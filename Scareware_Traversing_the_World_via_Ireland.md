In 2008, a dedicated group of security professionals came together to
set up IRISS-CERT, Ireland's first CSIRT, to provide a range of free
services to Irish businesses and consumers in relation to information
security issues. The aim is to help counter the security threats posed
to both the Irish businesses and the Irish Internet space.

Throughout the first two years, IRISS-CERT has notified and helped many
website owners detect, clean or restore their sites after a compromise.

In July 2009, several Irish websites were attacked and had malware code
injected into them. These (compromised) websites redirected end-users to
malicious websites, which subsequently served malware to anyone who was
browsing the original legitimate sites. The notification of this
compromise (to IRISS CERT) resulted in me beginning the on-duty Incident
Handler, initiating the Incident Handling Process to examine the issue.

Mark will summarise this aforementioned attack and briefly include other
types of attacks that IRISS-CERT have seen. He will primarily focus on
the process as laid out in his GIAC GCIH Gold Paper. The investigation
into the July 2009 attack and the associated complex infrastructure
prompted the research paper.

The talk will cover the various stages of the Incident Handling Process
explaining how they pertain to both the web application exploit and the
associated scareware installation.

By discussing these attacks, the talk should enable both companies and
volunteer organisations to improve Incident Handling efforts when
responding to Web Application attacks.

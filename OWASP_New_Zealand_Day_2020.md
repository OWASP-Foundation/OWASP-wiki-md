# Call for Sponsorships

## Call For Sponsorships

OWASP New Zealand Day 2020 will be held in Auckland on the 21st of
February, 2020, and is a security conference entirely dedicated to
application security. The conference is once again being hosted by the
University of Auckland with their support and assistance. OWASP New
Zealand Day 2019 is a very low-cost event, and requires sponsor support
to help be an instructive and quality event for the New Zealand
community. OWASP is strictly not for profit. The sponsorship money will
be used to help make OWASP New Zealand Day 2020 a compelling, and
valuable experience for all attendees.

Sponsorship funds collected are to be used for things such as:

  - Venue - Room use and on-site management fees
  - Name tags - We feel that getting to know people within the New
    Zealand community is important, and name tags make that possible
  - Promotion - We would like to reach a wider audience, by utilising
    paid advertising for the event
  - Printed Materials - Printed materials will include program
    information, room signs, and lanyards
  - Recognition items for speakers and trainers
  - Morning and afternoon tea, to promote a congenial environment for
    networking among application security professionals

## Facts

Last year, the event was supported by six premier sponsors and attracted
more than 650 attendees. Plenty of constructive (and positive\!)
feedback from the audience was received, and we are using this to make
the conference more appealing to more people. For more information on
the last New Zealand Day event, please visit:
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2019>

The OWASP New Zealand community is strong, with more than 500 people
currently subscribed to the mailing list ([sign
up](https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-newzealand)). OWASP
New Zealand Day is expected to attract between 700 and 850 attendees
this year.

OWASP regular attendees are IT project managers, IT security managers,
IT security consultants, Web application architects and developers, QA
managers, QA testers and system administrators.

## How to Become a Sponsor

All financial matters related to the conference, including Sponsorship
Agreements and payments, are handled through the OWASP Foundation. To
express interest in supporting the conference as a sponsor, please

    imprinted items if that proves infeasible.

    sponsors, must be free-standing, and their size is subject to

    auditorium preference, but final locations are at the discretion of
    the OWASP New Zealand Day Committee.
  - There will be a maximum of four (4) sponsor banners displayed in
    each auditorium, with placement priority given to Platinum Sponsors.

    keys, fidget spinners, etc.
  - Design of printed materials and imprinted items are subject to
    approval by OWASP New Zealand Day Committee

Thanks to the generous support of our lovely sponsors, we will have some
funding available to help people from around New Zealand attend the
OWASP NZ Day, who would otherwise find it hard to attend. In particular,
we welcome applications from women, people of colour, LGBTIQ, and all
others. You all deserve to be able to learn more about security, and
we’ll do our best to help make that happen\!

Our funds are limited, and we’ll be reviewing applications every week,
starting at the end of January. Submit your application soon, so we can
approve them promptly, and you’ll be in several review cycles\!

Process:

  - Fill out our Application Form - Available 1 December 2019
  - We will review and approve applications each week. The first reviews
    will be completed by 20 December.
  - We will contact all applicants and let them know the result of the
    review.
  - Successful applicants will be contacted to help sort things out.

We use the following criteria to help us decide who gets approved:

  - We are biased towards (but not exclusively for) diverse applicants.
  - We do attempt to maximise cost efficiency and will aim to get as
    many people to OWASP as possible, with our limited funds.

Each successful recipient can choose whether to be kept anonymous (in
which case only the OWASP NZ committee will know the details of your
funding), or to be put in touch with the supporting company whose
sponsorship is going towards your attendance (if applicable). We think
some of our sponsors may enjoy the opportunity to chat with you on the
day talk about your experiences and plans for the future, but that’s
totally optional and up to you.

If you have any questions, feel free to drop us an email:

# Code of Conduct

## Code of Conduct

We want to make the OWASP NZ Day a welcoming environment for all
attendees. To that end, we would like to remind you that all activities
associated with this event are subject to OWASP's [Conference
Policies](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Governance/Conference_Policies).
At their core, these policies are intended to promote and maintain an
inclusive, welcoming environment for all participants - actions
detrimental to that environment are unwelcome.

Speakers, trainers and sponsors have all been reminded of these
policies, and are expected to abide by them like all attendees.

If you have any concerns during the day, please seek out John, Austin,
or Brendan. We will make ourselves visible at the start of the day, so
you know what we look like.

# Overview

In 2019 the Foundation seeks to offer a better value proposition to
corporate sponsorship. Current supporters value exhibition and public
acknowledgment opportunities but have been interested in training and
better conference benefits. At the 2019 Staff Summit, the team
brainstormed the end state of updating our Corporate Sponsorship
Packages with a focus on value, shared benefit and simplicity.

# Goals

  - Increase our corporate sponsorship opportunities to further the
    mission of the Foundation
  - Simplify the options for corporate support into a set of tiered
    benefits
  - Provide more value to sponsors and conference attendees by hosting
    more exhibitors
  - Increase Corporate Sponsorship revenue by 25%.

# Milestones

  - 2019-02-21, Concept at Staff Summit

# Proposal

  - Add an additional level of corporate sponsorship, for a total of 4
    while adding additional benefits to the current top 2 levels.
  - Increase the cost of two of our current corporate sponsorship
    options.
  - The top 3 corporate sponsorship levels would offer a defined number
    of complimentary individual memberships.
  - The top 3 corporate sponsorship levels would offer a defined number
    of training seats at our global, local and/or regional events.
  - The top 3 corporate sponsorship levels would offer a defined number
    of complimentary exhibitor space at our global, local and/or
    regional events. These corporate sponsors would have first choice to
    choose their exhibitor space location at the particular event(s).
  - The top 2 corporate sponsorship levels would offer a defined number
    of on-site training days
  - $500 per event will allocated the Event P\&L

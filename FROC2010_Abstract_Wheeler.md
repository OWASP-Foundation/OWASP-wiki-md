## The Presentation: "Vulnerabilities in Secure Code - Now and Beyond"

Secure coding practices have advanced significantly within the past
decade. Yet, vulnerabilities remain despite the huge advances in secure
coding practices. This presentation will discuss real world

against code certified by our industryâ€™s top security programs.

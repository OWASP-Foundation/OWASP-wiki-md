\== The presentation ==

![Owasp_logo_normal.jpg](Owasp_logo_normal.jpg
"Owasp_logo_normal.jpg")Code injection vulnerabilities such as, SQL
injection, javascript injection, byte-code injection, etc… constitute
the most susceptible path of entry for rogue hackers into the corporate
networks of an organization. This paper discusses the core components of
Web Application code-injection attacks; the limitations of existing
approaches (such as regular expression searches) to prevent such
attacks; the paper introduces a new generalized approach to solving the
code-injection problem by building new solution vectors based on
compiler theory, in particular GLR parser theory combined with learning
engines to solve the attack identification problem. An brief
introduction to Trustifier ryū is provided as an example of practical
implementation of the theories and concepts put forth in this paper.

#### Speakers

## Dean Carter - Security-Assessment.com - "Where Worlds Collide" - PCI-DSS for OWASP practioners

Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) has become a
compliance requirement for many organisations. Due to its width and
breadth the PCI-DSS poses many and varied challenges to an organisation.
Achieving and maintaining compliance is not simply a technical issue –
it relies heavily on people, policy and processes. This session aims to
look at OWASP initiatives that can be related directly to the PCI-DSS.

The session will start with a very brief, high level overview of the
PCI-DSS and then look closely how various OWASP initiatives can be
leveraged in organisational compliance programs.

<b>Dean Carter</b>

Dean Carter leads the Security Advisory Services team within
Security-Assessment.com .

Dean has been in the IT industry for 17 years during which time he has
worked with a wide range of technologies, industries and companies. For
the past 7 of those 17 years Dean has spent the majority of his time
specializing in information security consulting for financial
organizations and telcos.

## Paul Craig – Security-Assessment.com - “Insecurity and the Internet”

For the last 5 years I have spent 10 hours a day successfully breaking
the internet. Networks, applications, services, it’s all insecure,
hack-able and often completely vulnerable. Through my work at
Security-Assessment.com I have pointed out critical security flaws in
the majority of New Zealand organizations. Hacking a multi-billion
dollar New Zealand organization is actually not that hard. This fact
really troubles me, and I find myself asking the question: “Why is the
internet insecure?” It is after all 2009, not 1999. Today I hope to
answer that question and find out why the internet is, and will likely
always remain insecure.

<b>Paul Craig</b>

Paul Craig is a principal security consultant at Security-Assessment.com
in Auckland New Zealand, where he leads the penetration testing team.
Paul is an active security researcher, published author, and a devoted
hacker. Paul specializes in application penetration testing, and
regularly speaks at security conferences around the globe.

## Brett Moore – Insomnia Security - “Vulnerabilities In Action”

Common application vulnerabilities have been known for years now, and
developers have been told about the threats and how to prevent these
flaws. Even so, web applications are still been developed that are
vulnerable to some of the oldest and most well known security flaws. The
aim of this presentation is to show the attendees how vulnerabilities
are discovered and exploited in real world situations, and the
devastating effect that a flaw can have on the security of an
application. The presentation will demonstrate multiple different
application vulnerabilities across various development languages and
operating systems. All of the commonly seen vulnerabilities will be
demonstrated, aligned with the OWASP top 10 rating system. Attendees
will be able to learn about the real dangers that application
vulnerabilities pose, by seeing them been exploited as they would in a
real compromise situation. The demonstration will be done again a
‘virtual’ network of vulnerable systems that will contain both server
and application level flaws, giving a real world insight to an
application compromise.

<b>Brett Moore</b>

Having conducted vulnerability assessments, network reviews, and
penetration tests for the majority of the large companies in New
Zealand, Insomnia founder Brett Moore brings with him over six years
experience in information security. During this time, Brett has also
worked with companies such as SUN Microsystems, Skype Limited and
Microsoft Corporation by reporting and helping to fix security
vulnerabilities in their products. Brett has released numerous
whitepapers and technical postings related to security issues and has
spoken at security conferences both locally and overseas, including
BlackHat, Defcon, Syscan, Kiwicon, Ruxcon, and the invitation only
Microsoft internal security conference called BlueHat.

## Roberto Suggi Liverani / Nick Freeman – Security-Assessment.com - “Exploiting Firefox Extensions”

Firefox extensions are popular, well-established and used by millions of
people around the world. Some of these extensions are recommended by the
Mozilla community, and are implicitly trusted by the masses.

Little is known about Firefox extensions from a security perspective and
our research intends to fill this gap. The talk is divided in two parts:
theory and practice. First, we will explore the security model of
Firefox extensions and present a security testing methodology. Next, we
will illustrate how we applied the theory and discovered severe
vulnerabilities in the most popular and recommended Firefox extensions.
Examples of exploits will also be demonstrated.

After this talk, attendees will have gained a better understanding of
the security implications, threats and risks of using and deploying
Firefox extensions. Security professionals and auditors will be able to
use our material as a security testing framework when auditing Firefox
extensions.

<b>Roberto Suggi Liverani</b>

Roberto Suggi Liverani is a senior security consultant for
Security-Assessment.com. He is the founder and leader of the OWASP (Open
Web Application Security Project) in New Zealand. Roberto has worked

## Nick von Dadelszen – Lateral Security - “Testing Web Services”

Web Services are now a major component of many organisation's online
presence. This could be in the form of AJAX-type consumer websites where
more processing is being passed to the browser, or in
corporate/governemtn b2b information-sharing environments. This talk
will focus on how to properly test web services, what to look for, and
some of the tips and tricks picked up through my testing of these types
of systems.

<b>Nick von Dadelszen</b>

Nick von Dadelszen has managed successful security teams for two
previous employers and is now a co-founder and director of Lateral
Security, responsible for technical delivery of projects. Nick has been
performing penetration testing in New Zealand for the last 10 years and
in that time he has worked with the majority of New Zealand's largest
organisations including government, financial and telecommunications
sectors.

## Mark Piper - Catalyst IT Ltd - “Application Bug Chaining”

As the number of useful, un-authenticated application bugs dwindles in
2009, the number of practical 'chained' exploits is growing.

Often, during development, it is very easy for developers (and
penetration testers) to focus on individual bugs within an application.
While these bugs may be serious, they are often difficult to exploit
practically. This talk will explore various conditions that may be found
within web applications to allow the 'chaining' of application bugs to
produce reliable and practical exploits.

A real world case study of how exploiting chaining can work will be
discussed, dissected and demonstrated to the audience.

<b>Mark Piper</b>

Currently working as a Linux Guy for Catalyst IT Ltd. Mark has a passion
for all things related to caffeine, UNIX and security.

In the past Mark has been both a UNIX Administrator and Principal
Security Consultant assisting and advising a large number of
organizations across New Zealand with regards to security. He has also
presented at a number of conferences including the OWASP conference in
Australia and OWASP evenings in New Zealand.

Mark is often called upon as a trusted advisor to various public and
private sector organizations regarding the practical, real world threats
they face.

## Andy Prow / Kirk Jackson - Aura Software Security / Xero - “XSS – The Gloves are Off”

XSS (Cross-site Scripting) is still one of the most common web-attacks
used today. Whether hidden in websites that have been vulnerable like
Twitter, Facebook, MSN, Hotmail and Amazon, or in PDFs or Flash, XSS
attacks are out in the wild. Just in May of this year we saw Gumblar
(a.k.a. Grumblar, Martuz, JSRedir) which hit the top-web-infections
lists around the globe – one of its growth techniques was good old XSS.

The key message of this presentation -“You’ve heard of XSS and you’ve
followed the “OWASP XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet” to protect your code,
but do you really understand each protection step, and does it really
matter if you miss one?”

To help answer this question in an easily understandable way this
presentation is not just another “XSS talk”, but more of a “Gloves are
Off” battle between good and bad. Andy takes the “bad-guy” role with XSS
attacks, Kirk is the “good-guy” defender, locking down his .Net website.
Who will win?

<b>Andy Prow</b>

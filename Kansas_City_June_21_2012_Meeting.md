<tt> This month we have extended the invitation to speak to Sergey
Shekyan from Qualys on the topic of Web Denial of Service, Attack and
Defense.

Date: Thursday June 21st. 7PM
Location: Regnier Center Room \#344
Johnson County Community College

While developers and administrators are focused on maintaining scalable
and complex interactive systems, another aspect is being overlooked:
making sure systems can detect and handle slow application layer DoS
attacks that consume available resources, and force servers to reject
legitimate clients.
Sometimes considered exotic and rare, slow DoS attacks can easily knock
out an unprepared server, as they use legitimate data and almost don't
differ from real traffic. Slow DoS attacks are exploiting protocol
flaws, and the handling of such attacks should be applied within the
server configuration, rather than setting up perimeter devices to
intercept the traffic. Without such protection, slow DoS attacks can
bypass traditional counter-DDoS systems undetected, and can harm
anything from HTTP servers to streaming servers, cache, proxy and
WebSocket servers.
Sergey will present a tool that can help find bottlenecks and help
developers and administrators to either apply existing tweaks, or
continue researching the problem with more details available, without
being distracted by having to implement their own proof of concept
solutions to test their systems.

The goal of presentation is to:

\- share information about such attack vectors, demonstrate the attacks
over HTTP and WebSocket protocols against HTTP, WebSocket , proxy,
cache, media streaming servers using new version of slowhttptest
\- discuss how information produced by the tool could be used to narrow
the problem
\- present mitigation recommendations and techniques.

<td><p><strong>OWASP Europe TOUR,</strong> is an event across the European region that promotes awareness about application security, so that people and organizations can make informed decisions about true application security risks. Everyone is free to participate in OWASP and all of our materials are available under a free and open software license.</p>
<ul>
<li>Apart from OWASP's Top 10, most OWASP Projects are not widely used and understood. In most cases this is not due to lack of quality and usefulness of those Document &amp; Tool projects, but due to a lack of understanding of where they fit in an Enterprise's security ecosystem or in the Web Application Development Life-cycle.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This event aims to change that by providing a selection of mature and enterprise ready projects together with practical examples of how to use them.</li>

\== Abstract == Omar's presentation:

Nokia has launched responsible disclosure program recently. Omar will
talk about experiences starting and running such a program as a part of
enterprise application security program. Common errors, solutions and
best practices will be explained to help other companies to improve
their security with this type of programs.

Gavin's presentation:

Jac0byterebel is not your typical social engineering presenter. Out goes
the snake oil sale of analysing the minutia of pop psychology and trying
to squeeze out real answers to the questions asked during a real social
engineering attack. In comes hard hitting accounts of social engineering
attacks drawn from real sources but anonymised to protect the pwned.

Deano, our ‘hypothetical’ bad-guy, could hack and social engineer his
way to cash in his pocket and no cash in your pocket. Easy, boring,
predictable. But what if Deano, a criminal social engineer, really upped
his game?

This talk will see Deano up the stakes and deliver the kind of
aggressive attack you have all lived in fear of. No longer a phone call
to get your credentials, or a rogue e-mail to direct you to a fake
website, this time its personal and Deano is looking to do you REAL
damage.

Drawing on real data from anonymised sources, from the account given of
this attack, attendees of the talk will see that a real social engineer
doesn’t once pick up a psychology textbook. Deano will instead pose you
a question -

“What if Deano could destroy my business without anyone realising it had
been attacked?”

Live in fear of Hactivism? You won’t sleep at night after meeting Deano.

If you want an hour and a half of being told that ‘looking to the right
makes you easier to social engineer’, go to another talk. If you want to
see how the real bad guy operates, and talk about how to defend against
him, then I look forward to seeing you there..

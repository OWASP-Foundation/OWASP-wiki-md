## Progress

12/7/2007 (Dublin Ireland) Getting there. Not as many volunteers as we
had for the testing guide. The more practical stuff is being covered at
the moment such as how to actually do a code review. Keywords to look
for when getting familiar with the code and identifying inputs and
outputs. The Java comon mistakes section is going alright also. Hope to
finish this by end of the summer but may be October/November.

### Update

27/8/2007 Reached the 50% Mark which has been verified by my good friend
Dinis. Hoping to complete guide pretty soon. May include Orizion guide
in Appendix. Not much contribution ongoing apart from myself, this is
pushing out ETA. Onward........

### Update

17/10/2007 The "First sweep of the code base" section is complete and
should facilitate static code review tools. completion by the 5/11 is
doubtful as a complete review is required and volunteers are scarce. May
need an extension by a few weeks.

### Update

5/11/2007 The Wiki is complete for this version of the Code Review
Guide. Currently it is being converted to MS doc and PDF.

### Update

14/11/2007 Code Review Guide (RC1) Completed The code review guide has
been completed and is available here:

book.

  - Proposal - OWASP should create a global OWASP-Alerts mailing list
    There has been a request for the creation of a single OWASP-wide
    vulnerability reporting mailing list, OWASP-alerts, so that
    corporations can monitor for vulnerabilities in our software. This
    is a PCI requirement. The items posted here would be security
    vulnerabilities in our libraries (ESAPI, AntiSamy, Encoding, and
    maybe our tools). Assuming we support the idea, we need to decide
    who would moderate the list.

  - Proposal - OWASP should move off of mailman and onto
    groups.owasp.org
    This brings the full power and ease of administration of Google
    Groups to an OWASP domain. The existing archives have been uploaded
    to Google docs where anyone can [search
    them](https://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0ByUwHYYmOdvrNTBiZGJlNzMtZWY3NC00YjZhLTgyOWUtNGFkZDE2ZGYwZTMx&hl=en).
    The only real hiccup is that people must have a google account to
    use this (or an owasp.org account). We can force add all existing
    members and their transition to the new list should be seamless -
    this will get them email list functionality. If they want the full
    forum, they'll need to have a google account. One other hiccup is
    that OWASP-ALL will generate one email per list. We can manage a
    list of lists, but any message will get multiplexed across all of
    them. Ideas?

  - Proposal - OWASP replace "cafe press" with an EBay Store to make
    OWASP branded gear available.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The goal of the Distributed Web Honeypot (DWH) Project is to identify emerging attacks against web applications and report them to the community. This may include automated scanning activity, probes, as well as, targeted attacks against specific web sites or applications. The scope of this project has recently been expanded to include deployment of both standard web application honeypots and/or open proxy honeypots. Project participants may choose whether they want to run their honeypot as an open proxy or a stand-alone sensor.</p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>This project fills a need in the web application Defender's community to have detailed data about mass web application scanning attacks such as those being operated by Botnets. This project will provide detailed data about attacks and their origins.</p>

# How to Participate

There are two ways to participate:

## Deploy a honeypot sensor

You can participate by deploying the Web Honyepot sensor on your own
network. We has created a VMware image of the standard sensor. This
image includes all of the software to quickly get your sensor up and
running with little configuration on the end user's part. You must
contact the project leader via email in order to participate. You will
then receive the link location to download the VMware image. You will
need to have the free version of VMware player or Server. If you would
like to deploy a honeypot sensor, include the following details in your
email to the project leader:

  - Sensor Point of Contact (POC) name
  - Source IP address that the logs will be coming from
  - Geographic location (Country, State, Locality)
  - Network Block Owner

The Project Leader will send back an email with instructions for
downloading the VMware honeypot image data and the OS root credentials.
The VMware host is configured with dhcp, so after you login, verify that
the host has successfully obtained an IP address. The Project Leader
will also provide you with the ModSecurity log agent credentials you
will need to authenticate when sending your log data. ModSecurity uses a
C program called mlogc located in the /usr/local/apache/conf/ directory.
This program will take the data generated by the ModSecurity concurrent
audit log and uses HTTP PUT requests to upload the individual audit_log
files to the central console host. Each honeypot sensor will have a
unique username/password combination. The file that you will need to
update is /opt/wasc-honeypot/etc/mlogc.conf. The final step is to start
up the apache web server - /etc/init.d/wasc-honeypot-ctl.sh start. You
should then review the log files to ensure that they everything is
working properly.

## Data analysis

Even if you do not deploy a honeypot sensor, we need help with data
analysis for the capture traffic. We will provide access to the
ModSecurity AuditConsole web interface to all project participants. The
AuditConsole has built in searching and reporting functions that may be
used for batch analysis. We will provide all project participants with a
reporting procedure so that we have a consistent process for vetting
data prior to releasing to the public.

# FAQs

  - Are there any legal issues I should be concerned with?
    The short answer is **yes** - if you choose to run your honeypot as
    an open proxy server. There are some legal issues to be aware of in
    this type of honeypot setup where we will be capturing third party
    user information. The Honeynet Project has excellent information on
    the challenges and issues surrounding due diligence in deploying
    honeypots/honeynets. Refer to this paper on Honeynets. In their book
    Know Your Enemy they have an entire chapter dedicated to Legal
    Issues. It is this concern over increased risk why we expanded the
    project scope to allow for deployment of stand alone web sites
    instead of running it as an open proxy.

<!-- end list -->

  - Should I run this on my production environment?
    That depends on your risk tolerance and whether or not you want to
    run the honeypot as an open proxy. If your organization is willing
    to approve it, then the program itself is a virtual host and will
    run under any host that runs VMware. We have many varied
    organizations participating ranging from universities, ISPs and
    government networks.

<!-- end list -->

  - Can I run the sensor at home?
    Sure, many participants are running the sensors from their home
    network. You shoud, however, consult your ISP's AUP info before
    deploying any web servers. There may be conflicts with your ISP
    allowing inbound HTTP traffic however the honeypots are
    pre-configured to listen on common proxy ports including 8000, 8080
    and 3128.

<!-- end list -->

  - Should I announce the honeypot IP address on public lists?
    That is up to you however be aware that if the sensor IP address
    becomes posted to pubic open proxy lists that more than likely your
    sensor will become flooded with SPAMMER traffic.

<!-- end list -->

  - What prerequisites do I need to participate?
    An understanding of ModSecurity functionality will help to
    understand the rules and logs being generated. Review the following:

# Road Map and Getting Involved

As of April 2015, the priorities are:

The main roadmap item is to solicit participants to deploy Sensors to
collect data. The main deliverables for this project are: 1) Real-world
web attack data, 2) Real-time web attack data and 3) Technical details
that can be leveraged by the OWASP Defenders community to help protect
their websites. Think of this project as somewhat similar to the SANS
Dshield project where the community correlates data and can also obtain
reputation services for blocking IP addresses, etc...

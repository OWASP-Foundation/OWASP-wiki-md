## The presentation

WAFs or Web Application Firewalls are being deployed to fix security
issues in your web applications. The question is, are they?

In this presentation we take a look at some of the issues related to
making use of this solution and how it may affect the overall security
posture of your web application. Finally we will describe tools to
automate detection of WAFs, and also tools to help identify ways to
bypass WAFs.

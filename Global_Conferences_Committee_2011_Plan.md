## Initiatives

  - OWASP Conference management system (Goal 1, 3)
      - We need a system to take in applications for events, vett them,
        approve them, and schedule them. The current process of people
        emailing Kate, Me or the board is not acceptable with the number
        of events we have
      - I see this as critical to establishing control over the OWASP
        schedule and is a top priority
  - OWASP AppSec Track (Goal 2)
      - Partnership with projects committee
      - Have a cadre of speakers, ready to go with presentations about
        OWASP projects/activities
      - Require all OWASP Regional and AppSec events to have an “OWASP
        Track” of at least 6 presentations from this pool, managed,
        selected, and funded by the GCC and the GPC
  - OWASP Global Conference Sponsors (Goal 3, 7)
      - Provide unified sponsorships for the Global AppSec Conferences
      - Split revenues among individual conferences budget
      - Streamlines our sponsorships
      - Conference planners are welcome to elicit additional
        sponsorships
  - Central conference support services (Goal 3)
      - Investigate for-hire international conference support companies
          - Event logistics companies
      - Investigate costs for hiring conference organizer
          - Foundation Employee
  - Conference Marketing (Goal 3)
      - OWASP Conference Twitter accounts
      - OWASP Conference Domain Names
          - Register Names only
          - <http://www.AppSecNA.org>
          - <http://www.AppSecUS.org>
          - <http://www.AppSecEU.org>
          - <http://www.AppSecAsia.org>
          - <http://www.AppSecSA.org>
          - If already owned by a conference, buy them out/transfer to
            GCC Control
          - GCC will re-direct to any hosting service once the
            conference has been assigned
          - Conference can still register AppSecXX2011.org and we can
            just redirect as appropriate
          - Helps maintain consistency in URLs between years
      - Conference Twitter Accounts
          - Like domains, turned over to planners for their use as
            appropriate
          - @OWASPConferences – held by the GCC for announcements
          - @OWASPAppSec – held by the GCC for announcements
          - @AppSecNA
          - @AppSecUS
          - @AppSecEU
          - @AppSecAsia
          - @AppSecSA
      - Use of Short URLS on the owasp.org website
          - ex <https://owasp.org/AppSecBR> points to the wiki page for
            this year’s conference
      - Regional Targeted Mailing Lists
          - To reduce OWASP All traffic
  - OWASP Merchandise Model(Goal 3, Goal9)
      - A shippable “OWASP Store” with OWASP branded items for sale at
        conferences
      - Already exists, just need to formalize
  - OWASP Conference Marketing (global, regional, electronic, print)
    (Goal 4,5,6)
      - Procure Booth space at developer focused conferences
      - Provide budget for OWASP Schwag for use at OWASP Booths in other
        conferences
      - Evaluate other advertising mechanisms for conferences

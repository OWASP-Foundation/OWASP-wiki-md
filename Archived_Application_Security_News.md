    "First it was porn, now it's privacy - a technical stuff-up on
    reality show Big Brother's website is said to have exposed the
    personal details of fans who signed up for its special features.
    Following reports that visitors to a pirate Big Brother site were

    numbers of people who registered for the official site were able to
    be viewed by others"

    SDL?](http://www.enterprisenetworkingplanet.com/netsecur/article.php/3673056)**
    Ken van Wyk discusses the importance of process for producing secure
    software, and notes that attacks on Vista may undermine the general
    support for Microsoft's approach. Check out Michael Howard's
    [talk](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Image:OWASPAppSec2006Seattle_SecurityEngineeringInVista.ppt)
    from the last OWASP conference for a great discussion on the success
    of the SDL.

  - **Apr 19 - [Why the software market is full of
    lemons](http://www.wired.com/politics/security/commentary/securitymatters/2007/04/securitymatters_0419?currentPage=all)**
    Bruce Schneier finally chimes in on an [old OWASP
    theme](http://www.aspectsecurity.com/documents/Aspect_HCSS_Unsafe_At_Any_Speed.ppt)
    - the problem of assymetric information between software buyers and
    sellers. He only talks about security products, but the same problem
    affects all types of software. Check the \[[Software Facts
    Label](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Types_of_application_security_metrics)
    which is an idea for actually doing something to change the game.

  - **Apr 10 - ["There is no
    hope"](http://www.csoonline.com/alarmed/?source=nlt_csoupdate)**
    Despite all the good stuff at OWASP, Scott Berinato is giving up.
    "No official announcement is forthcoming, but the Internet is broken
    and it can't be repaired. Oh, it's still there. You can still use
    it. Then again, if you went hiking and came across an old,
    broken-down mine shaft, you could still use that, too."

  - **Mar 15 - [local IE 7 phishing
    hole](http://aviv.raffon.net/2007/03/14/PhishingUsingIE7LocalResourceVulnerability.aspx)**
    Provides a nice proof of concept with CNN (Link at the bottom).
    "Internet Explorer 7.0 is vulnerable to cross-site scripting in one
    of its local resources. In combination with a design flaw in this
    specific local resource it is possible for an attacker to easily
    conduct phishing attacks against IE7 users." CNET News also picked
    this up as a
    [story](http://news.com.com/2100-1002_3-6167410.html?part=rss&tag=2547-1_3-0-20&subj=news).

    Disclosure](http://mybeni.rootzilla.de/mybeNi/2007/gmail_information_disclosure/)**
    Only a tiny XSS hole to demonstrate a disclosure proof-of-concept
    through AJAX/JSON of all contacts you ever mailed. If a domains
    covers a lot of functionality and users, one XSS can be devastating.
    Remember the Google Desktop vulnerability. What is frightening is
    that it took Beni only \~5 minutes to find a XSS hole.

    respond to this threat will result in real risk to any enterprise
    that stores financial or customer data. While the problem is a
    serious one, it is not something that cannot be fixed so long as
    proper attention and budget are allocated to it. Unfortunately,
    given the unique nature of the problem and its impact on the

    there were 7,247 new vulnerabilities recorded and analyzed by the

    vulnerabilities per day. This total represents a nearly 40 percent
    increase over what ISS reported in 2005. Over 88 percent of 2006
    vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely, and over 50 percent
    allowed attackers to gain access to a machine after exploitation. "

    An attacker can find out whether you're logged into your favorite
    website or not. They include a script tag where the src attribute
    doesn't point to a script, but instead to a page on your favorite
    websites. Based on the error the script parser generates when trying
    to parse the HTML of the page that's returned, the attacker can tell
    whether you're logged in or not. Should extend to access control
    easily. Protect yourself with CSRF protection.

    "The site asks for your user name and password, as well as the

    information to test whether the site is legit -- a tactic used by
    some security-savvy people -- you might be fooled. That's because
    this site acts as the "man in the middle" -- it submits data
    provided by the user to the actual Citibusiness login site. If that
    data generates an error, so does the phishing site, thus making it
    look more real."

    A pretty complete writeup about the exploit of an
    [XSS](Cross-site_Scripting_\(XSS\) "wikilink") flaw in PayPal - "The
    scam works quite convincingly, by tricking users into accessing a
    URL hosted on the genuine PayPal web site. The URL uses SSL to
    encrypt information transmitted to and from the site, and a valid
    256-bit SSL certificate is presented to confirm that the site does
    indeed belong to PayPal; however, some of the content on the page
    has been modified by the fraudsters via a cross-site scripting
    technique ([XSS](Cross-site_Scripting_\(XSS\) "wikilink")). When the
    victim visits the page, they are presented with a message that has
    been 'injected' onto the genuine PayPal site that says, "Your
    account is currently disabled because we think it has been accessed
    by a third party. You will now be redirected to Resolution Center."
    After a short pause, the victim is then redirected to an external
    server, which presents a fake PayPal Member log-In page."

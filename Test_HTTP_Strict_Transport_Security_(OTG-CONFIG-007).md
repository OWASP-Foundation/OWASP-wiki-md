## Summary

The HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) header is a mechanism that web
sites have to communicate to the web browsers that all traffic exchanged
with a given domain must always be sent over https, this will help
protect the information from being passed over unencrypted requests.

Considering the importance of this security measure it is important to
verify that the web site is using this HTTP header, in order to ensure
that all the data travels encrypted from the web browser to the
server.

The HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) feature lets a web application
to inform the browser, through the use of a special response header,
that it should never establish a connection to the the specified domain
servers using HTTP. Instead it should automatically establish all
connection requests to access the site through HTTPS.

The HTTP strict transport security header uses two directives:

  - max-age: to indicate the number of seconds that the browser should
    automatically convert all HTTP requests to HTTPS.
  - includeSubDomains: to indicate that all web applicationâ€™s
    sub-domains must use HTTPS.

Here's an example of the HSTS header implementation:
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=60000; includeSubDomains

The use of this header by web applications must be checked to find if
the following security issues could be produced:

  - Attackers sniffing the network traffic and accessing the information
    transferred through an unencrypted channel.
  - Attackers exploiting a man in the middle attack because of the
    problem of accepting certificates that are not trusted.
  - Users who mistakenly entered an address in the browser putting HTTP
    instead of HTTPS, or users who click on a link in a web application
    which mistakenly indicated the http protocol.

## How to Test

Testing for the presence of HSTS header can be done by checking for the
existence of the HSTS header in the server's response in an interception
proxy, or by using curl as follows:
$ curl -s -D- https://domain.com/ | grep Strict Result expected:
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=...

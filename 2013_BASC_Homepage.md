This is the homepage for the 2013 Boston Application Security Conference
(BASC). This fre conference will take place on Saturday, December
14<sup>th</sup> at [Microsoft New England Research and Development
Center (NERD)](http://microsoftcambridge.com/Default.aspx).

The BASC will be a free, one day, informal conference, aimed at
increasing awareness and knowledge of application security in the
greater Boston area. While many of the presentations will cover
state-of-the-art application security concepts, the BASC is intended to
appeal to a wide-array of attendees. Application security professionals,
professional software developers, software quality engineers, computer
science students, and security software vendors should be able to come
to the BASC, learn, and hopefully enjoy themselves at the same time.

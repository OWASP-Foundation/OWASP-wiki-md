**AGENDA**

**Title:** OWASP Limerick - introduction, objectives, meeting agenda


19:05 - 19:50
**Title:** **HTML5 - A Whole New Attack Vector** - presented by Robert
McArdle
**Abstract:** HTML5 opens up a wide and wonderful new world for Web
Designers to explore - bringing fantastic new features that were
previously only possible via Flash or horribly over-complicated
Javascript. And HTML5 is not a future technology - chances are your
favourite browser already has excellent support built in (unless you are
still using IE). In this talk we will look at HTML5 from an attackers
view-point. Because not only does HTML5 bring us Semantic web, editable
content, inbuilt form validation, local storage, awesome video support
and the long overdue death of

<div>

\- it also opens up a host of new opportunities for attackers. We'll
look at some of the troublesome new attacks that this new HTML5 standard
introduces, how attackers can leverage these attacks to cause untold
havoc on your machine, and how - with a little bit of help from some not
so over-complicated Javascript - we can build Botnets in your
Browser\!
**Presenter:** Robert is currently working as the manager of Trend
Micro's Advanced Threat Research team in Europe, where he is involved in
analyzing the latest malware threats, specializing in researching the
future threat landscape and criminal underground. Robert is a regular
presenter for the press and at security conferences. He has also written
and lectures an MSc module in Malware Analysis at Cork IT and UCD, and
is a trainer for several SANS qualifications. A graduate of Trinity and
DCU he holds several qualifications from SANS and serves on the SANS
advisory board.


19:50 - 20:05
**Title:** **EU Data Protection Reform** - presented by Niall Ahern
**Abstract:** In the almost 20 years since the introduction of the EU
Data Protection Directive our understanding of personal privacy has been
changed by globalisation, the commercialisation of personal data,
digitisation and social media. In response the European Commission
intends to introduce new uniform EU wide Regulations for Data
Protection. This presentation will consider the proposed changes, their
potential commercial consequences and benefits.
**Presenter:** Niall works in Dell’s Compliance and Information Security
group. For the past 6 years he has been a member of a Limerick based
team covering compliance, policy and risk for Dell IT globally. In the
real-world he enjoys rowing, running and rugby, all pleasant distraction
from being a CPI Internal Security Assessor and successfully completing
the wearisome ISACA CISM exam.


20:05 - 20:55
**Title:** **Practical Defense with mod_security WAF** - presented by
Marian Ventuneac
**Abstract:** Marian will introduce the mod_security Web Application
Firewall (WAF). This session will be a practical demonstration of
mitigating security risks for a sample vulnerable Web application.
**Presenter:** [Marian

**OWASP Limerick Chapter Raffle:** Two sponsored software
development/information security books will be available for this

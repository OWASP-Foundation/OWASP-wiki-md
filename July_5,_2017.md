  - Project Handbook Update - Andrew van der Stock
      - "The Board directs OWASP Foundation staff to make updates to the
        Project Handbook as applicable to include two project leaders
        for Flagship projects, with a period of public comment before it
        takes effect. The updated guidelines should include:
          - Flagship Projects shall have two leaders from different
            organizations to avoid independence issues in appearance or
            in actuality
          - Lab Projects looking to be promoted to Flagship shall have
            two project leaders as per Flagship requirements to be
            eligible for promotion
          - If during a project review it is identified that a project
            leader has become dormant, or through project leader
            resignation or transfer, the project has a period of three
            months to identify as many project leaders as required to
            resolve the situation or risk being demoted to Lab status at
            the next project review
          - A grace period of until the end of 2017 shall apply to the
            new independence requirements to allow projects time to
            promote a second leader.
      - Foundation Staff are directed to work with affected Projects,
        including ensuring timely processing of leadership promotion
        through the usual process."

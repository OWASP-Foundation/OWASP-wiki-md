## Summary

Some websites offer a user registration process that automates (or
semi-automates) the provisioning of system access to users. The identity
requirements for access vary from positive identification to none at
all, depending on the security requirements of the system. Many public
applications completely automate the registration and provisioning
process because the size of the user base makes it impossible to manage
manually. However, many corporate applications will provision users
manually, so this test case may not apply.

## Test objectives

1.  Verify that the identity requirements for user registration are
    aligned with business and security requirements.
2.  Validate the registration process.

## How to test

Verify that the identity requirements for user registration are aligned
with business and security requirements:

1.  Can anyone register for access?
2.  Are registrations vetted by a human prior to provisioning, or are
    they automatically granted if the criteria are met?
3.  Can the same person or identity register multiple times?
4.  Can users register for different roles or permissions?
5.  What proof of identity is required for a registration to be
    successful?
6.  Are registered identities verified?

Validate the registration process:

1.  Can identity information be easily forged or faked?
2.  Can the exchange of identity information be manipulated during
    registration?

### Example

In the WordPress example below, the only identification requirement is
an email address that is accessible to the registrant.

In contrast, in the Google example below the identification requirements
include name, date of birth, country, mobile phone number, email address
and CAPTCHA response. While only two of these can be verified (email
address and mobile number), the identification requirements are stricter
than WordPress.

## Tools

A HTTP proxy can be a useful tool to test this control.

## Remediation

Implement identification and verification requirements that correspond
to the security requirements of the information the credentials protect.

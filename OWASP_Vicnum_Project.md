<p>OWASP Vicnum Project is a collection of intentionally vulnerable web applications and will now includes an intentionally vulnerable web API.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>“Flexible, realistic, vulnerable web applications useful to auditor’s honing their web application security skills”</p>
<p>They demonstrate common web application vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross site scripting.</p>
<p>Vicnum applications are commonly used in Capture the Flag exercises at security conferences.</p>

# FAQs

  - Q1 Anything I need to set up vicnum?
    There are help folder in some downloads, and readmes on github as
    well as a pdf manual. Basically set up the database, make sure the
    apache modules are loaded and for Guessnum and Jotto modify the http
    config file to find the perl code in the cgi-bin folder.
  - Q2 Is there a way to make the challenges harder or easier?
    Sure. Some suggestions are in the help file, one of them of course
    is to delete the help file. You can also modify the backdoors,
    allow/disallow indexing of folders, or change the encoding of hidden
    fields.
  - Q3 Is there more to it than just technical challenges?
    Absolutely. In hacking a web application looking at the nature of
    the app or examining the so-called business logic is always a good
    idea. So looking for the back doors and hidden files is definitely a
    goal here.

# Acknowledgements

## Volunteers

Vicnum is developed by a worldwide team of volunteers. The primary
contributors to date have been:

  - Nicole Becher
  - Mordecai Kraushar

## Others

Vicnum has been demonstrated at many chapter events, many attendees have
provided feedback afterwards. In particular a big shout out to Daniel
Zabib, Anthony Martini and Albert Fong who helped customize Vicnum
applications for the APPSECUSA conference.

The Vicnum Project is affiliated with the Brooklyn OWASP chapter.

# Road Map and Getting Involved

The vulnerable API \!

API’s are everywhere\! Mobile & web applications applications, cloud
services, the Internet of Things and embedded devices are all
communicating via API’s.  A vulnerable API can be just as destructive as
a vulnerable web application.  So, how do you test an API?   The
vulnerable API has a number of serious issues including many of the
classic OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.  This release is meant for pen
testers, breakers and developers and will demonstrate some of the common
flaws that are found in API’s such as:

-----

Authentication

-----

Injection

-----

Verbosity

-----

Transport Encryption Denial of Service

-----

Insecure Direct Object References

-----

Unrestricted File Uploads

Involvement in the development and promotion of Vicnum is actively
encouraged\! You do not have to be a security expert in order to
contribute. Some of the ways you can help:

  - Coming up with a name (and maybe themes for a vulnerable API
    program)

# Project About

__NOTOC__ <headertabs />

Vicnum was introduced in 2009, Early releases introduced several
vulnerable apps (and CTFs) including Guessnum, Jotto and the Union
Challenge. Recent release upgrades are:

V1.5 (December 2013) Cyclone, a vulnerable Ruby on Rails Application

-----

V1.6 (June 2014) Breaking Bad XXE Exploit

-----

V1.7 (December 2015) Basic CTF to parse a pcap

-----

V2.0 will be introduced in May 2016 and will include an intentionally
vulnerable API.

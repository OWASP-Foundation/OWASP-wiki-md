The OWASP Software Security 5D framework represents a practical
framework that focus on 5 dimensions to evaluate the maturity of a SDLC
and create the best Software Security Roadmap in a fast way.
The key areas are the following:
\- SwSec PROCESSES
\- SwSec TESTING
\- SwSec TEAM
\- SwSec AWARENESS
\- SwSec STANDARDS
Traditional Secure SDLC frameworks lack of:
\- level of awareness for all the people involved in the process
\- description of the application security roles involved
\- set of security standards
\- security testing tools adopted

This new model aims are:
\- build a more practical Secure SDLC for the Companies
\- have a fast assessment to undertand the actual maturity of a
Company
\- create a reliable way to build a concrete Software Security Program

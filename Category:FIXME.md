error and don't know how to fix it, you can

1.  **Easy Way:**
      -
        tag it with this category. just put the following directly in
        the text, as close to the problem as possible.
        \[\[Category:FIXME|put a descriptive comment about the problem
        here\!\!\!\]\]
2.  **Best Way:**
      -
        read the **[Wiki Cleanup](Wiki_Cleanup "wikilink")** Page and
        use
        [<nowiki>{{TaggedDocument](:Template:TaggedDocument "wikilink")-Template
        at the top of the page.

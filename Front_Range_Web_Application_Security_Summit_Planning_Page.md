## Panel Discussion Topics

These are preliminary ideas; PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CONTRIBUTE by logging
in to the wiki... It seems likely that only one or two will be able to
get in-depth discussion; the remainder may be subject to a "Lightning
round."

1.  Biggest problem incorporating security into the SDLC and how/if it
    was overcome
2.  Cost-justification strategies - how did you sell this?
3.  If there was one thing you'd do differently...
4.  The secret to motivating developers, testers, and QA'ers to adopt
    secure coding practices...
5.  Was a launch really postponed due to security concerns? What's the
    rest of the story?
6.  What are the best resources or references for succeeding in this
    area?
7.  What do you look for when hiring someone or engaging a company to
    participate with your SDLC
8.  What's your favorite story about how your Security Ops or Management
    team REDUCED your overall security in the name of security?
9.  At what point should security be introduced into the SDLC?
10. What are some of the ways the group has seen security tools used
    internally and externally?
11. How much time is really needed for manual testing?
12. How do I budget for security testing (manual or otherwise) on
    applications?

### Jeremiah Grossman, Founder and CTO, WhiteHat Security - Business Logic Flaws – Seven Deadly Web Exploits

Jeremiah Grossman founded WhiteHat Security in August 2001.

An internationally recognized security expert, Mr. Grossman is a
frequent speaker at security industry events including RSA, CSI NetSec,
Black Hat, ISACA Network Security Conference, ISSA and Defcon. He is a
popular security media resource, featured in USA Today, The Washington
Post, InformationWeek and on NBC news, and was recently named a “friend
of Google.” Mr. Grossman is also an influential blogger
(www.jeremiahgrossman.blogspot.com) who offers insight and encourages
open dialogue regarding current research and vulnerability trend
information. He frequently alerts the media community to the latest
attacks and is not only able to offer in-depth commentary that usually
finds its way into their stories, but can also provide his perspective
of what’s to come.

Grossman is also a founding member of the Web Application Security
Consortium (WASC). Prior to WhiteHat, Mr. Grossman was an information
security officer at Yahoo\!.

**Summary:** Session handling, credit card transactions, and password
recovery are just a few examples of Web-enabled business logic processes
that malicious hackers have abused to compromise major websites. During
this presentation, Jeremiah Grossman will examine seven real-world
scenarios that demonstrate how pernicious and dangerous business logic
flaws are to the security of today’s websites.

### Robert Rachwald - Director of Product Management, Fortify Software - The Evolution of Application Security in Online Banking

Rob is a 10-year veteran of the high tech industry. Rob started his tech
career at Intel, where he worked on automating their complex supply
chain. Rob managed U.S. product marketing for Commerce One and managed
their marketing efforts in Asia Pacific. Rob, then, managed marketing
for Coverity and joined Fortify as the Director of Product Marketing
focusing on security and financial services.

**Summary:** With trillions of dollars in transactions, how do the
world's leading financial institutions defend against massive cyber
attacks while delivering new features and products to customers quickly?
How are software security tools, such as dynamic and static analysis,
deployed for optimal use? Using case studies, learn how online banking
has set the standard for effective application security. We’ll provide
an overview of the industry’s migration to online banking and analyze
the many security challenges that banks overcame during online banking’s
infancy, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting and privilege
escalation.

We will then move toward broader security issues, including the steps
needed to ensure a secure and robust infrastructure. In addition, we
will examine the implementation of Web 2.0 technologies within an online
banking environment and discuss the security issues these new
technologies bring with them. The session will conclude with two
critical take-aways: developing a compliance strategy to leverage the
secure development lifecycle, and the steps IT professionals need to
take when preparing online corporate infrastructure against future
attacks and vulnerabilities.

### Akshay Aggarwal - Microsoft ACE Team “Application Security Kung Fu: Threat Modeling your way to competitive advantage”

Akshay Aggarwal is a security strategist and researcher. He is currently
a Practice Manager for Microsoft Information Security’s ACE Team where
he leads the information security consulting practice for North America.
He is responsible for securing Microsoft’s ecosystem by developing a
robust security practice, incubating new service lines & helping
enterprise customers develop world-class IT security strategies.

Previously as a Senior Security Technologist, Akshay was responsible for
conducting architecture design, threat modeling, application security
assessments and vulnerability research. He helped Fortune 100 clients
evaluate the security of their software products and applications. He
has authored several security research papers and been invited to speak
at many forums like the RSA Security Conference and Black Hat briefings
at Las Vegas.

Akshay holds a MS in Computer Science from the University of California
at Davis. There, at the renowned Computer Security Lab, he conducted
research on Internet worms and intrusion detection systems.

**Summary:** Microsoft’s approach to threat modeling line of business
(LOB) applications is based on a simple principle: Building a secure
application requires an understanding of the threats against that
application. The challenge has been the difficulty in adopting threat
modeling practice for software application development. Over the past
two years, the Microsoft Application Consulting & Engineering (ACE) team
has developed a process that allows non-security subject matter experts
to produce feature-rich threat models. The process:

  - Provides a consistent methodology for objectively identifying and
    evaluating threats to applications.
  - Translates technical risk to business impact.
  - Empowers a business to manage risk.
  - Creates awareness among teams of security dependencies and
    assumptions.

Microsoft Application Threat Modeling is a critical security activity,
enabling effective application risk management during the SDLC and
beyond. Application Threat Modeling is enforced as part of the Security
Development Lifecycle for IT (SDL-IT) at Microsoft IT. This talk will
focus on the need for a robust and secure development lifecycle for
applications and the value mature organizations can derive from threat
modeling.

Commerce, West Austin Rotary, WASC, IACSP, APWG, he is the Industry
Liaison for the Austin ISSA and contributed to the OWASP 2.0 guide.

**Summary:** Browser security is one of the least known but most
important aspects to modern security. They are ubiquitous and highly
insecure. They are close enough alike that many exploits will work cross
browsers, and they are different enough that it makes it difficult for
websites to protect themselves. This speech will cover the history of
browser security, where it today and where it needs to go in the future.

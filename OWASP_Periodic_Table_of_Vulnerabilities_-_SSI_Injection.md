### SSI Injection

## Root Cause Summary

The root cause of server-side includes/injection is the application's
failure to validate data before it is inserted into a server-side
interpreted HTML file. Some Web servers allow entering dynamic code to
static HTML pages making it possible for an attacker to send code to a
web application that will get executed by the web server and possibly
gain access to files or other exploits similiar to cross site scripting.

NIST organized an exposition [(SATE)](http://samate.nist.gov/SATE.html)
for static analysis tools that find security relevant defects. Our goals
are to enable empirical research based on large test sets and to
encourage tool improvement. Briefly, participating tool makers run their
tool on a set of open source programs. The results and experiences are
shared at a workshop. The test sets, tool reports, and analysis are made
publicly available later.

We present our experience organizing the exposition, discuss our
observations of tool reports, and describe our plans for the next
exposition.

In October 2010 we held the experience workshop for the third SATE.

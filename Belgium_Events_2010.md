    The Smart Grid brings greater benefits for utilities and customer
    alike, however these benefits come at a cost from a security
    perspective. This presentation will explore how the increased
    functionality and complexity also increases the Smart Grid's attack
    surface, or in other words, increases the ways attackers can
    compromise the Smart Grid's new infrastructures, systems, and
    business models. We'll discuss several specific attack avenues
    against the Smart Grid and recommendations for mitigating or
    blocking these attacks.
    [Justin Searle](http://www.linkedin.com/in/meeas), a Senior Security
    Analyst with InGuardians, specializing in the penetration testing of
    web applications, networks, and embedded devices. Justin currently
    leads the Smart Grid Security Architecture group of the CSWG (Cyber
    Security Work Group) for NIST (National Institute of Standards and
    Technologies) and is a member of ASAP-SG (Advanced Security
    Acceleration Project for the Smart Grid). Previously, Justin served
    as JetBlue Airway’s IT Security Architect, and has taught courses in
    hacking techniques, forensics, networking, and intrusion detection
    for multiple universities and corporations. Justin has presented at
    top security conferences including DEFCON, ToorCon, ShmooCon, and
    SANS. Justin co-leads prominent open source projects including the
    Samurai Web Testing Framework, Middler, Yokoso\!, and Laudnum.
    Justin has an MBA in International Technology and is CISSP and SANS
    GIAC-certified in incident handling and hacker techniques (GCIH) and
    intrusion analysis (GCIA).

  - 20h00 - 21h00: **[How I Met Your
    Girlfriend](http://media.blackhat.com/bh-us-10/whitepapers/Kamkar/BlackHat-USA-2010-Kamkar-How-I-Met-Your-Girlfriend-wp.pdf)**
    (by Samy Kamkar)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    The discovery and execution of entirely new classes of attacks
    executed from the Web in order to meet your girlfriend. This
    includes newly discovered attacks including HTML5 client-side XSS
    (without XSS hitting the server\!), PHP session hijacking and weak
    random numbers (accurately guessing PHP session cookies), browser
    protocol confusion (turning a browser into an SMTP server), firewall
    and NAT penetration via Javascript (turning your router against
    you), remote iPhone Google Maps hijacking (iPhone penetration
    combined with HTTP man-in-the-middle), extracting extremely accurate
    geolocation information from a Web browser (not using IP
    geolocation), and more.
    [Samy Kamkar](http://samy.pl/) is best known for the Samy worm, the
    first XSS worm, infecting over one million users on MySpace in less
    than 24 hours. A co-founder of Fonality, Inc., an IP PBX company,
    Samy previously led the development of all top-level domain name
    server software and systems for Global Domains International (.ws).
    In the past 10 years, Samy has focused on evolutionary and genetic
    algorithmic software development, Voice over IP software
    development, automated security and vulnerability research in
    network security, reverse engineering, and network gaming. When not
    strapped behind the Matrix, Samy can be found stunt driving, getting
    involved in local community service projects, and continuing his
    focus on staying out of jail.

    (by Joe McCray, Learn Security Online)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    SQL Injection is a vulnerability that is often missed by web
    application security scanners, and it's a vulnerability that is
    often rated as NOT exploitable by security testers when it actually
    can be exploited. Advanced SQL Injection is a presentation geared
    toward showing security professionals advanced exploitation
    techniques for situations when you must prove to the customer the
    extent of compromise that is possible.
    The key areas are:
      - Re-Enabling stored procedures
      - Old and new ways of obtaining an interactive command-shell
      - Data Exfiltration via DNS
      - IDS Evasion & Web Application Firewall Bypass
      - Privilege Escalation
    **Joe McCray** has 10 years of experience in the security industry
    with a diverse background that includes network and web application
    penetration testing, forensics, training, and regulatory compliance.
    Joe is a frequent presenter at security conferences, and has taught
    Ethical Hacking and Web Application Security at Johns Hopkins
    University (JHU), University of Maryland Baltimore College (UMBC),
    and several other technical training centers across the country.

    (by Erwin Geirnaert and Frank Cornelis)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *Presentation + discussion:* What can go wrong when implementing the
    Belgian eID in an unsecure way to authenticate a user? We will
    discuss the security issues, the problems with trust, SSL and some
    examples of a bad implementation. We will demo how to use WebScarab
    to intercept and change authentication data on the fly,
    impersonating somebody else.
    To help developers to implement it correctly, we will give away best
    practices and a road map to do it properly using the new eID applet
    with entity authentication.
    This presentation will be given by **Frank Cornelis**, Developer @
    Fedict, who is responsible for the new eID applet and **Erwin
    Geirnaert**, co-founder & white-hat hacker @ ZION SECURITY, who has
    reviewed unsecure implementations of eID authentication

  - 20h15 - 21h15: **Analyzing the Accuracy Of Web Application
    Scanners** (by Larry Suto)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *Presentation + discussion:* Analyzing the Accuracy Of Web
    Application Scanners
    This talk summarizes my recent
    [study](http://ha.ckers.org/blog/20100203/accuracy-and-time-costs-of-web-application-security-scanner-report/)
    related to benchmarking a set of web application scanners against
    target test sites constructed by the scanner vendors themselves. I
    will review the methodology and some of the challenges that were
    faced as the tests were conducted. I have received some interesting
    feedback from the vendors and the security community. This new
    information will be integrated into the presentation. The
    controversial nature of "Point and Shoot" and "Trained" scanning
    will be addressed and scanning issues related to cloud
    computing/SaaS will be covered. The presentation will cover some
    thoughts on open source scanners such as Skipfish and W3AF. Finally
    I will go into the ideas for another round of testing and the
    possibility of soliciting target apps from the community.
    **Larry Suto** is an application security consultant based in the
    San Francisco Bay Area. He is focused on software security analysis
    and the testing the effectiveness of software security tools.

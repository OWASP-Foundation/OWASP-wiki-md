"Owasp_logo_normal.jpg")This talk will focus on exploiting SQL
injections in web applications with oracle back-end and will discuss all
old/new techniques. The talk will target Oracle 9i,10g and 11g (R1 and
R2) It is widely considered that the impact of SQL Injection in web apps
with Oracle back-end is limited to extraction of data with the
privileges of user mentioned in connection string. Oracle database does
not offer hacker friendly functionalities such as openrowset or
xp_cmdshell for privilege escalation and O.S code execution. Further,
as Oracle by design do not support execution of multiple query in single
SQL statement, the exploitation is further restricted. The Talk will
highlight attack vector to achieve privilege escalation (from Scott to
SYS) and O.S code execution, all by exploiting Oracle SQL injections
from web applications.

As a number of organizations move to compliances like PCI thereby
ensuring that the Card data is always stored encrypted with the private
key never stored inside the database. The talk will focus on what
hackers are doing in the wild to bypass these and to obtain clear text
card data when its only stored encrypted or even when its never stored
at all.

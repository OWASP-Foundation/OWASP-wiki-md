# 2013 OWASP International Board of Directors Election

The OWASP Foundation was established in 2001 as an open community and
software security resource. Since then, OWASP has grown to be globally
recognized as a credible source for application security standards (see
industry citations). Individuals typically find OWASP when searching the
internet for information about software security - and they are happy to
find a reliable source of knowledge built by an extremely open and
passionate community. OWASP is open to anyone. Anyone can attend OWASP's
vendor agnostic local chapter meetings, participate in regional and
global conferences, and contribute to the many OWASP projects. And
anyone can start a new project, form a new chapter, or lend their
expertise to help an OWASP Global Committee.

The OWASP Foundation Board of Directors currently consists of six
elected volunteers (seven starting in 2014). These unpaid volunteers
dedicate themselves to the organizational mission and playing a pivotal
role in the software security community. OWASP conducts democratic
elections of its Board Members to enable bottom-up advancement of its
mission.

### International Board of Directors Primary Responsibilities

Seated members of the Board of Directors attend and contribute to
monthly meetings. [See
Archive](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Board_Meetings).
Additionally, they:

1.  Create and review a statement of mission and purpose that
    articulates the organization's goals, means, and primary
    constituents served globally. They then support that mission and
    purpose.
2.  Support all employees. The Board should ensure that the employees
    have the moral and professional support needed to further the goals
    of the organization.
3.  Ensure effective planning. The Board must actively participate in
    the overall planning process for the organization and assist in
    implementing and monitoring the organization's goals.
4.  Monitor and strengthen programs and services. The Board's
    responsibility is to determine which programs are consistent with
    the organization's mission and monitor their effectiveness.
5.  Ensure adequate financial resources. One of the Board's foremost
    responsibilities is to secure adequate resources for the
    organization to fulfill its mission.
6.  Protect assets and provide proper financial oversight. The Board
    must assist in developing the annual budget and ensuring that proper
    financial controls are in place.
7.  Build a competent Board. The Board has a responsibility to
    articulate prerequisites for candidates, orient new members, and
    periodically and comprehensively evaluate their own performance.
8.  Ensure legal and ethical integrity. The Board is ultimately
    responsible for adherence to legal standards and ethical norms.
9.  Enhance the organization's public standing. The Board should clearly
    articulate the organization's mission, accomplishments, and goals to
    the public and garner support from the community.

Additional Responsibilities that the International Board of Directors
must adhere to can be found here [Board of
Directors](https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/document/d/sP5OOETtzriv6bC6L6zzr6g/headless/print#heading=h.hgfxswibcczn)

### OWASP Foundation Board of Directors Updates

<span style="color:red">Note: Changes were decided and voted on at the
August 19, 2013 Board Meeting</span>

  - **Board Orientation Documents** - An official board orientation set
    of documents will be created that includes a stated conflict of
    interest policy (in addition to what we have in the bylaws), 2
    required reading short books on non-profit foundations, requirement
    to read previous financial reports and 990, and links to our to-be
    created governance page. All board members will sign and acknowledge
    completion of the orientation by Jan 1, 2014.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Conflict of interest policies** will also be extended to all
    employees and those in decision making roles for global conferences.
    We see this as a natural step to mature OWASP and better align with
    non-profit requirements. This is not in response to any concerns.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Board Size** - OWASP bylaws specify the board must be between 5
    and 7 members. Currently the OWASP board is 6 members. We voted to
    extend to 7 members. The 2013 election will now seat 4 spots instead
    of 3. The newly elected board members will begin their terms Jan 1,
    2014. At this time we'll see the board officially expand to 7
    members.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Quarterly Board Meetings** - The board voted to move board
    meetings from the current schedule of monthly 1 hour meeting to
    quarterly 4-6 hour meetings. The schedule of meetings will be set by
    the board in December before the year. It is likely the the board
    meetings will take place on Saturdays or on a dedicated day before a
    large OWASP conference. This change is a result of the success of
    the longer format board meeting and also a result of the Executive
    Director role that has enabled full time involvement and focus on
    OWASP operations. This will take effect in January, 2014.

### Eligibility Requirements for Board Candidates

You need to be an OWASP member. **NOT** just paid members, but an active
project and chapter contributors are eligible. All candidates must be in
good standing for a twelve (12) month period of time prior to
**30-September 2013**. Candidates are required to submit a bio, current
membership number and note if you are a paid or honorary member. You
will be contacted shortly after your response for an audio
interview/podcast. If you are interesting in running for the board then
please submit your intention along with the requirements listed above
to: [Call for Candidates](http://www.tfaforms.com/284825)

#### OWASP Academies meeting - 5th, 6th January

## Preparatory meeting for the Summit'11

Following the email sent in October regarding the OWASP Academies and
the work OWASP is developing to implement and operationalize this
concept, multiple feedback and contributions for the discussion have
been received.

We thought that one way to turn the feedback and interest received into
something positive and constructive would be to sit the people involved
at a table and discuss experiences, views and ideas for the OWASP
Academies' operational model. Knowing, for example, how the already
established connections with Universities were started and how they are
working, what would seem to these partners the most reasonable “next
step” in terms of formalization or knowing what, from the Universities’
point of view, would be an interesting model of relationship, could be
of great use for our own definition and consolidation of the OWASP
Academies concept.

In this context, **a meeting will be held on the 5th and 6th of January,
in Lisbon,** with the following format:

  - Two days (5th and 6th January) of **working sessions focused on the
    OWASP Academies** where the operational model will be discussed with
    the intent to prepare a draft that can be presented and debated in
    the Summit'11 to happen in February;
  - Main objectives should be:
      - Definition of the concept behind the OWASP Academy model;
      - Discussion of Certification;
      - Identification of a "to do" list for the Summit'11.

The meetings will take place at [ISCTE, Lisbon University
Institute](http://www.iscte.pt/), in Lisbon. Address is Av.ª das Forças
Armadas, 1649-026 LISBOA.

Unfortunately, due to budgetary constraints, it will not be possible for
us to invite all who have contributed for the discussion and pay for
their traveling and accommodation. We have therefore devised a criteria
of selection for paid invitations that takes into account both the level
of engagement in the discussion and the amount of work already done
within the Academic community.

Having said that, if you find sponsorship to fund your trip and stay in
Lisbon, you will be very welcome to join us – just drop
[me](mailto:sandra.paiva@owasp.org) a line to let me know you are
coming\!

#### Conclusions of the Meeting

**Following two days of intense and animated debate** about what would
be the best model to support the OWASP Academies, **the team gathered in
Lisbon has reached the following results:**

  - The OWASP Academies will be embodied by the **OAP (OWASP Academic
    Portal)**


\* The **OAP** will be an online platform, mainly aimed at professors
and students, comprised by 3 distinct components

  -   - **Blocks** – sets of teachable contents formatted for diverse
        purposes and ready to use

<!-- end list -->

  -   - **Labs** – platforms with vulnerable apps and hands-on exercises

<!-- end list -->

  -   - **Community** – where interaction platforms, foruns and tools
        facilitating asynchronous communication will be made available


\* It has been decided that an OWASP Project would be created to support
this area of work – [OWASP Academy Portal
Project](OWASP_Academy_Portal_Project "wikilink")
\* The OPA will be led by [Martin
Knobloch](user:Knoblochmartin "wikilink"), Ricardo Melo and
[Konstantinos Papapanagiotou](user:Conpap "wikilink") and will have the
following contributors: Vasileos Vlachos, Jim Burkman, Andreas
Fuchsberger, Jason Taylor, [Carlos Serrão](User:Pontocom "wikilink"),
Filipe Lacerda, Ed Adams, [Dinis Cruz](user:Dinis.cruz "wikilink")
\* Filipe Lacerda accepted the responsibility of hosting the 1st version
of the OWASP Academies Portal and Vasileos and Kostas will ensure the
hosting of the Labs of the Portal
\* Security Innovation has agreed to sponsor this Project by providing a
hosting environment that allows SCORM eLearning content, forums,
glossary, resources (such as zip, word, pdf, etc) and tracking and
reporting features
\* It has been agreed that the 1st version of the OAP will be presented
at the Summit'11

## UPDATE - 11 Jan 2011

We would like to inform that, within the context of the Academies
meeting and what has there been discussed, [Carlos
Serrão](User:Pontocom "wikilink") (Portuguese Chapter Leader and
Assistant Professor at ISCTE - Instituto Universitário) has informed us
of ISCTE's interest in discussing the idea of creating a Summer Course
on the AppSec area.

Following a more detailed conversation with Carlos and a subsequent
discussion with [Dinis Cruz (OWASP Board)](user:Dinis.cruz "wikilink"),
it has been decided that [Sandra Paiva](user:Sandra_Paiva "wikilink"),
[Paulo Coimbra](user:Paulo_Coimbra "wikilink") and [Carlos
Serrão](User:Pontocom "wikilink") would draft a plan for the creation
of a Summer School.

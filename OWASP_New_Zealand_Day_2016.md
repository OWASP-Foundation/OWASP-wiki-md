    application security. Afternoon sessions will dive deeper into
    technical topics, and build on the morning sessions.
  - Management: After an introduction to web application security, one
    of the afternoon streams will focus on informational and defensive
    topics.
  - Security Professionals and Enthusiasts: Technical sessions later in
    the day will showcase new and interesting attack and defence topics.

# Speakers List

## Speakers List

### Dan Wallis - Christchurch ISIG - Credit card fraud; you don't want to be the common point of purchase

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

A real-world example of how three problems lined up to leak credit card
data online. Each problem wasn't by itself enough to leak anything
valuable, but by their powers combined, the bank called. I'll talk
through the details of each flaw, why they were introduced, how they
lined up, and lessons learnt.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

I'm a sysadmin with lots of web experience; I've been in the industry
for more than 10 years. I currently work for an agency in Christchurch,
focusing on ecommerce websites.

### Emmanuel Law - Aura Information Security - Chronicles of SOP bypass

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

Same Origin Policy (SOP) is one of the fundamental protection when
surfing the internet. It's in all browsers, various plugins and mobile
applications. This talk will walk the audience through a history of some
of SOP most interesting bugs; ranging from some of the earliest
manifestations to the more recent SOP bypasses. Although many of these
SOP bugs are beyond the control of the developers but we'll cover some
mitigating measures that one could possibly take.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Principal security consultant @ Aura Information Security (NZ) by day,
he spends his nights exploiting stuff for fun and profit.

### Valentinas Bakaitis - Aura Information Security - Keep calm and CSP

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

CSP stands for Content Security Policy and is a reasonably new mechanism
to protect against client side vulnerabilities like XSS and XSRF.
Applied correctly it can completely eliminate nearly all XSS issues,
regardless whether they are known or unknown. While the mechanism is
extremely, effective and in most cases easy to implement, the adoption
remains low. This talk will introduce CSP to those who are not familiar
with it and remind about the power of it to those that heard about it
before.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Developer turned Security Consultant. Valentinas has 10 years of
experience in IT industry, with last two years working as a security
consultant. His interests include IT security, physical security and
hardware hacking.

### Russell McMullan - Beca Ltd - Risk based software assurance requirements for aircraft systems

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

This talk focuses on the contribution of the design methods used in
aircraft system development and their contribution to security. This
includes an overview of aircraft system design requirements and design
rules, how the system and software ‘Design Assurance Level’ is
determined, and an overview of the Software ‘Assurance Level’
requirements used in software development. I’ll provide my personal
thoughts on the Design Assurance Level contribution to security
including the inherent aircraft system design principles and processes
that contribute to security, and some thoughts on augmenting these
practices with the Common Criteria requirements.

If you’ve ever wondered about aircraft systems software development,
this talk may be of interest.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

With 20+ years associated with military aircraft systems, Russell has a
unique view of system and software risk methods for aircraft systems.
Russell currently works at Beca in the Advisory team.

### Chris Campbell - Jade Software - Making AppSec a (Respectable) Religion

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

No stranger to rapid transformation, Jade Software – a leading
technology company with an almost 40 year pedigree, today works with an
ever increasing range of technologies to solve complex problems for its’
customers. .NET, HTML5, SQL, Oracle, Java, Azure and AWS cloud services,
and of course the JADE platform, all form part of the Jade technology
stable.

Using the latest and greatest technology stack only gets you so far. But
to maintain the reputation of producing market leading, enterprise-level
solutions, robust security practices are a must. Making security a key
component of your SDLC with minimal interruption can be achieved with
assistance from an OWASP project (or a few), coupled with a lot of
passion.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Chris, who in a past life was a .NET developer, is a Security &
Operations Consultant at Jade Software. His role sees him managing
operational and user security, and overseeing both the security and
architecture of development and operational projects which span a wide
variety of industries.

### Sergey Ozernikov - Lateral Security - Oauth 2.0: The Promise and Pitfalls

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

OAuth 2.0, the second version of the popular authorisation framework,
was proposed as an IETF standard in October 2012 and has since been
implemented and used by companies such as Facebook, Google and
Microsoft. In January 2013 an RFC containing a comprehensive threat
model of OAuth 2.0 was introduced. It was as long as the initial
specification which had left out a lot of security considerations, most
likely as it was assumed that developers would know how to securely
implement OAuth 2.0. However many didn’t and without the necessary
security controls, many relatively benign web application
vulnerabilities could now flourish on a much larger and bountiful attack
surface. An open redirect directly leading to an account compromise?
Easy. In this talk, an overview of what should be catered for when
integrating OAuth 2.0 into your project and how not to introduce
additional security risks, will be provided. Most common attack vectors
and some examples of real-life vulnerabilities in OAuth 2.0
implementations will be presented. Ideally attendees should have a basic
understanding of OAuth 2.0 flow and web application security.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Sergey has gained his experience in the field of information security
working for several Russian commercial and government organisations for
around 7 years after finally realising that he enjoys breaking and
protecting things more than building them. In 2013 he moved to New
Zealand and shortly after joined Lateral Security as a security
consultant.

### Chris Smith - Insomnia Security - Attacking Real-World Crypto Flaws

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

Everybody knows by now not to roll your own crypto, right? RIGHT? But,
as an attacker, how do you go about identifying and exploiting these
flaws for your own benefit. And, as a defender, how can you gauge the
full impact of such flaws and ensure you steer clear of them?

So forget about the LUCKYBEASTCRIMEPOODLE13 for now, this talk is going
to focus on real-world crypto flaws in everyday software. We'll look at
some cryptographic issues I've come across in my travels, and how to
exploit them. And along the way, we might just learn something about
doing it correctly, too\!

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Chris is a consultant for Insomnia Security where he breaks other
peoples stuff and writes reports about it. Previously a Linux sysadmin
and polyglot developer, he now exacts his revenge on technologies that
have wronged him.

### Felix Shi - Xero - Practical Attacks on WebRTC Applications

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

WebRTC is a browser-based technology that allows peer-to-peer
communication via a list of predefined APIs. It has gained popularity
among many video conferencing, telephony, and file sharing applications.

Research has been done on its design, architecture, and potential attack
vectors against applications that use it. This talk will focus on
practical attacks that can be performed on applications that use WebRTC,
and how to mitigate against them.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Felix works in the product security space at an online accounting
software company named Xero. He joined in 2014 and his day job involves
securing and breaking internally developed products. Before Xero he
spent his previous years as a developer, and has been dabbling in the
information security scene in Wellington.

### Nilesh Kapoor - Aura Information Security - Host Hardening : Achieve or Avoid?

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

This is still a question mark for most of the business and application
owners; host hardening – Avoid or Achieve. This paper covers the real
world scenario of a potential server compromise due to the lack of OS
hardening, running secure but unpatched services over the Internet and
the host review process and approach backed up with OWASP guideline and
CIS benchmark. This talk also touches on host review and hardening
automation techniques for medium-sized and enterprise organisations.

This topic aims; Increase the awareness and importance of host review
and hardening among business owners, application owners, server
administrators and developers. Answer basic questions such as what host
review involves, what approach is recommended for structured host review
and achieving compliance, how to create a hardening baseline standard
and apply them to your organisation policy Automate host review process
and hardening for servers hosting critical data

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Nilesh Kapoor is the author of “Security Testing Handbook for Banking
Applications” published by IT Governance. He is currently working as a
Senior Security Consultant with Aura Information Security. He has over 8
years of experience in security consulting, application security, host
review and hardening, network security, enterprise solution security and
mobile security. He is also a registered penetration tester with CREST
and a CEH certification holder. His articles are published on IITP blogs
and also maintain own security blog at
<http://nileshkapoor.blogspot.com>.

### Shahn Harris - Beca Ltd - I judge all of your services and applications

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

I will explain the process that goes on inside a corporate/enterprise
when a corporate security team is contacted to evaluate a new
application or service by a business unit. The first questions asked
have nothing to do with your SDLC, choice of code, framework or
potential integration points. the questions are more what is it, what
does it do and where does it live and what do they know. Come to this
talk if you wish to discover what information most large
corporates/enterprises will ask of you if you try to sell a
product/service to them. By taking the learnings from this talk it could
potentially save you lots of time,money and

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Shahn has worked for/with a number of different flagship New Zealand
companies across multiple sectors and industries as a security
consultant.

### Laura Bell - SafeStack - Continuous Security

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

Agile development is a powerful tool for the creation of high-quality
software products. It has however scared the life out of many security
managers and risk leaders. Once the job of a dedicated security team,
security is now the responsibility of all members of our Agile teams.

So how do we bring continuous security to our lifecycles without
compromising velocity and innovation? What tools and techniques do we
need and when should we apply them?

In this talk, we will examine why security is the new key skills for
successful Agile development teams and what you can do to bring it to
your teams.

This is a talk of war stories from the SCRUM team trenches and real
world tools, techniques and processes that are less about 'managing'
security than they are about building amazing(secure) things, fast.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

With almost a decade of experience in software development and
information security, Laura specialises in bringing security survival
skills, practices and culture into fast-moving environments.

Laura has spoken at various events such as BlackHat, BlueHat, Velocity,

### Kevin Alcock - Katipo Information Security Ltd - After 30 Years, I’m Coming Out

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

This talk is about my journey from a software development veteran with
30 years of experience to an information security noob. The intended
audience is for information security noobs looking to get better and web
application developers wanting to understand how their applications are
vulnerable. The focus is on the Offensive Security (makers of Kali
Linux) course Penetration Testing Training with Kali Linux and the
Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) certification exam.
There will be no spoilers for those that are currently doing the course
and exam. OWASP projects such as ZAP, Dirbuster and Broken Web
Applications will be discussed on how they help me. I will also discuss
which of the OWASP Top 10 (2013) vulnerabilities I used to gain access
to the systems on the lab network.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Kevin has spent the last 30 (10 in North America) years in enterprise
software development and delivery, now he is turn that experience
towards the information security sector to help businesses in need.

### Carlos Cordero - Convergnce - Information Security is a Marketing Responsibility

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

KPMG’s Global CEO Outlook Survey (July 2015) showed that 50% of global
CEO’s say that their organisations are “not fully prepared” for a “cyber
event”. Additionally, information security related risks are perceived
to be “the most unpredictable kind of risk”. CEOs and Boards expect the
IT function to take care of this aspect of the business risk portfolio -
for obvious reasons: they own the IT infrastructure or manage it on
behalf of other functions (logistics, operations, HR, accounting,
finance, etc.). Unfortunately, nobody has told the marketers.

In the last 3 to 5 years, marketing departments have taken upon
themselves to bring into the organisation a smorgasbord of systems and
applications, with little or no consultation with the IT department. The
result is an unprecedented increase of infosec and legal risks that few
organisations are even aware off, much less managing.

Our presentation would consist of 15-20 minutes sharing:

In this presentation we will: (1) Describe briefly the current situation
and how we got to it. (2) Give an insight into the mindset of “the
marketer” and an explanation of why “marketers” are oblivious to
security. (3) Suggest a map of the marketing-related risks for
businesses in the 201X going forward into the 202X (4) Offer a
prediction of the evolution of the marketing-related risks and its
implications for information security professionals. (5) Offer
suggestions regarding how these risks should be approached in order to
reduce the exposure that the marketing department is bringing to the
organisation.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Carlos is a marketing and intelligence consultant. One of his current
areas of interest and research is risk in the marketing context.

### Andrew Kelly - Insomnia Security - Two-Thirds of the Sacred Triangle

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

"People, Process, and Technology" has been the sacred mantra, or triad,
of IT for as long as I've been in the business. Unfortunately, whether
you consider it a 'strategy for success', part of your overall 'holistic
approach', or even 'the smell of good business', it's too often ignored.
That is, two of the three are, as we all race to install faster,
cheaper, more efficient, or 'better' technologies, in order to save
money, stay ahead of our competitors, or sometimes even just for the
sake of it? My talk will, hopefully, remind you that that "People,
Process" part is as important as, maybe even more so, than the tech. Or,
as Douglas Adams put it: "It is a mistake to think you can solve any
major problems just with potatoes." List of the author's previous
papers/articles/speeches on the same/similar topic: Previously, and
similar, at ISIG, ISF, OWASP, etc.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Andrew started in InfoSec back when the dinosaur's still ruled the
Earth. At least, that's how his fellow InfoSec workers, and often his
audiences, view him anyways. But, even though his useful working life is
slowly coming to its inevitable end, he reckons he still has a little
something to offer his fellow IT professionals. Even if every other
sentence these days begins with: "Back in my day..." and most of the
others with: "Damned kids..." Between nanny naps, Andrew is still
relatively gainfully employed as the GM for Insomnia Security.

### Daniel Jensen - Security Assessment - Practical exploitation of less commonly identified vulnerabilities

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

Recently I decided to look for some slightly more "complex"
vulnerabilities in a PHP project. The open source video platform Kaltura
was chosen for no particular reason other than looking vulnerable and
having no prior CVEs. Surprisingly, a large PHP based project actually
contained some fairly serious (and interesting) issues such as SSRF,
object injection, and poor cryptography. This talk will provide some
practical advice for finding less commonly identified vulnerabilities,
their impact, and how to mercilessly exploit them in a real world
application, using Kaltura as our test subject.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Daniel is a consultant at Security-Assessment.com where he hacks
assorted systems and carries out research (read hacks). Before that he
enjoyed a brief stint as a sysadmin, and spent too many years south of
the Cook Strait in a misguided attempt at attending university. He
currently resides in the bustling metropolis that is Auckland City, and
resents having to write his own biography.

### Brendan Jamieson - Insomnia Security - Deserialization, what could go wrong?

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

So you're just gonna pass off that data to unserialize()? What could
possibly go wrong?

This talk is focused on the deserialization class of web application
vulnerabilities. What are they? How are they introduced into web
applications? Just how bad can deserializing that arbitrary object
really be?

In this talk we'll cover real-world examples of deserialization
vulnerabilities being introduced, and exploited, across a number of
languages. We'll then look at options that are available to developers
to avoid introducing this class of vulnerability into their
applications.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Brendan Jamieson is a security consultant for Insomnia Security, based
out of Wellington. He is active in the .nz infosec community, having
spoken at Wellington's ISIG, and involved in Kiwicons as a speaker; a
trainer; and also the event organiser for the Hamiltr0n CTF.

### David Waters - Lateral Security - Source Code Reviews: Why You Should

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

In this talk I will give the case that you should be using security
focused code review as part of your defensive strategy. I will talk
about the types of bugs that are more easily found with either white-box
penetration tests or code reviews as opposed to more limited penetration
tests. I will then present some real world examples of issues found
during code reviews.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

David is a Senior Security Consultant at Lateral Security, David
previously worked in the Security Team at Google in London and draws on
16 years experience as a systems and web developer, primarily working in
.NET, Java and JavaScript.

## Call For Presentations

OWASP New Zealand Day conferences attract a high quality of speakers
from a variety of security disciplines including architects, web
developers and engineers, system administrators, penetration testers,
policy specialists and more.

We would like a variety of technical levels in the presentations
submitted, corresponding to the three sections of the conference:

  - Introductions to various Web Application Security topics, and the
    OWASP projects
  - Technical topics
  - Policy, Compliance and Risk Management

The introductory talks should appeal to an intermediate to experienced
web developer, without a solid grounding in web application security or
knowledge of the OWASP projects. These talks should be engaging,
encourage developers to learn more about web application security, and
give them techniques that they can immediately return to work and apply
to their jobs.

Technical topics in the afternoon should appeal to two audiences -
experienced web application security testers or researchers, and web
developers who have a “OWASP Top Ten” level of understanding of web
attacks and defenses. You could present a lightning, short or long talk
on something you have researched, developed yourself, or learnt in your
travels. Ideally the topics will have technical depth or novelty so that
the majority of attendees learn something new.

For the “Management Stream” in the afternoon we would like to invite
talks that will appeal to those interested in the various non-technical
topics that are important in our industry. These talks could focus on
the development of policies, dealing with compliance obligations,
managing risks within an enterprise, or other issues that could appeal
to those in management roles.

We encourage presentations to have a strong component on fixing and
prevention of security issues. We are looking for presentations on a
wide variety of security topics, including but not limited to:

  - Web application security
  - Mobile security
  - Secure development
  - Vulnerability analysis
  - Threat modelling
  - Application exploitation
  - Exploitation techniques
  - Threat and vulnerability countermeasures
  - Platform or language security (JavaScript, NodeJS, .NET, Java, RoR,
    etc)
  - Penetration Testing
  - Browser and client security
  - Application and solution architecture security
  - PCI DSS
  - Risk management
  - Security concepts for C\*Os, project managers and other
    non-technical attendees
  - Privacy controls

The email subject must be "OWASP New Zealand 2016: CFP" and the email
body must contain the following information/sections:

  - Name and Surname
  - Affiliation
  - Telephone number
  - Email address
  - Short presenter bio
  - Title of the contribution
  - Type of contribution: Technical, Informative, Management
  - Suggested length for the talk
  - Short abstract (up to 500 words)
  - List of the author's previous papers/articles/speeches on the
    same/similar topic (if any)
  - If you are not from New Zealand, will your company support your
    travel/accommodation costs? - Yes/No

The submission will be reviewed by the OWASP New Zealand Day conference
committee and the highest voted talks will be selected and invited for
presentation.

PLEASE NOTE:

  - Due to limited budget available, expenses for international speakers
    cannot be covered.
  - If your company is willing to cover travel and accommodation costs,
    the company will become "Support Sponsor" of the event.

Please submit the above information to all of the following: Denis
Andzakovic (denis.andzakovic@owasp.org), Adrian Hayes
(adrian.hayes@owasp.org) and Kim Carter (kim.carter@owasp.org).

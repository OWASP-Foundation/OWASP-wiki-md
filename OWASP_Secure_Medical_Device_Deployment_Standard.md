<p>With the growth of electronic medical records systems and the increasing use of network enabled medical devices, hospitals and other healthcare related facilities are becoming more interconnected than ever. While this increasing level of interconnectedness often results in improvements to both the quality and efficiency of patient care, it is not without some potential security drawbacks. Many medical devices are extremely costly to upgrade or replace and such legacy systems within healthcare facilities are often commonplace. Moreover, many medical devices were engineered with patient safety and life saving as the sole functions of the device and little attention was traditionally paid to the security of these devices. These trends are evidenced by recent FDA recommendations as well as numerous security studies that find many medical devices rife with security vulnerabilities. Additionally, such networked enabled medical devices within hospitals are often not deployed with security in mind, which can further add to the ease of compromise. With the explosion of botnets and other malware that now target IoT devices (of which medical devices can be considered a subtype) the need for security minded deployments of medical devices is now more essential than ever. This guide is intended to serve as comprehensive guide to the secure deployment of medical devices within a healthcare facility.</p>
<p>Version 2 of the standard was developed in conjunction with the <a href="https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/">Cloud Security Alliance</a>. <img src="CSA_logo.png" title="fig:CSA_logo.png" alt="CSA_logo.png" width="400" /></p>

Leader's know how you would like to contribute and pitch in to help the
project meet it's goals and milestones. There are many different ways
you can contribute to an OWASP Project, but communication with the leads
is key.

## If I am not a security expert can I participate in your project?

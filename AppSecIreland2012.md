# Secure Coding Competition

## OWASP AppSec Ireland 2012 Secure Coding Competition

### What’s this about?

OWASP AppSec Ireland 2012 will host a secure coding competition to give
you and your friends the chance to test your secure coding skills and
challenge other secure coders for the title of AppSec Ireland 2012
Secure Coding Competition (SCC) Champions. The competition is open to
everybody and is designed to promote awareness of the benefits of
designing and developing secure applications – a skill that all aspiring
and accomplished software developers should aim to possess.

### Tell me more...

You and your friends will form a team of between 2 and 4 people to
design and develop the most secure Java or .NET application based on a
web application requirement specification that will be handed out on the
morning of the first day of the competition. The onus will be on
developing a functioning and usable web application without sacrificing
on security. Teams will be scored on functionality, usability,
reliability and security.

If you'd like to take part in the competition but don't have a team to
join, you can email one of the organising team and let us know. We will
keep a list of people wanting to join a team and we can put you in touch
with each other, after which the team can register.

### How will it be judged?

Teams and their finished applications will scored on a number of areas:

  - Short discussion with the esteemed judging panel on design approach
    and consideration for OWASP Top 10 web application vulnerabilities
  - Demonstration of working functionality as per requirements
  - Automated secure code review using a leading commercial static
    source code analysis tool
  - Automated vulnerability scanning of application using a leading
    commercial application vulnerability scanner

Scoring will be designed to promote both a secure approach to, and
implementation of, web applications. We want you to demonstrate that
there does not need to be a trade-off between functionality and
security.

### When is it on?

The competition will be ran over the two training days of the conference
on the 4th and 5th of September, with the results and prizes awarded on
the day of the presentations, the 6th of September. Teams will need to
be around the conference for short presentations to the judges on the
6th as well.

### What do we need to bring with us?

You are allowed to bring any equipment you want and you can set up a
local area network between your team if desired. In order to reflect the
realities of the modern constantly connected world, Internet access will
be allowed and will be provided. However, abuse of this privilege, such
as attempts to plagiarize other applications, could lead to
disqualification. Teams will be responsible for providing their own
software (SDK, web server and database) and software licenses.

### What can I win?

The winning team first and foremost will be showered with the adulation
and adoration of the OWASP community. In addition, the winning team will
receive a cash prize and goody bags, the inaugural trophy and be crowned
OWASP AppSec Ireland 2012 SCC Champions\! There will be runner-up prizes
and goody bags for second and third place.

### Who can enter?

The competition is open to everyone from academic, students, open-source
and industry backgrounds. A registration fee of €100 per team is
required in order to prevent teams signing up and then not showing up on
the day. In some cases this registration fee may be waived - please
contact the organising team for applicability. Due to the time and
resources required to run this type of event places will be limited to 8
teams in total so registering early is vital if you want to reserve your
place.

### OK I'm interested. Where can I sign up?

Registration is now open here: <http://reg.appsecireland.org> (redirects
to cevent.com). Just follow the usual registration process and select
the "Secure Coding Competition" option and the give the details of your
team. Make sure to read the longer list of rules in the fine print
section below.

### Who can I contact about this?

Please contact Niall Jordan ( niall.jordan at owasp dot org), Marian
Ventuneac (marian.ventuneac at owasp dot org) or Eoin Keary (eoin.keary
at owasp dot org) for any questions relating to the competition

### So what's the sneaky fine print?

Here is fine print that we think you should know about before
registering (it's not really sneaky):

  - As stated already, you are responsible for providing your own
    software, hardware and licenses. As well as obviously requiring a
    SDK and a web application server, teams will also need to have some
    form of database software for the web application to interface with.
  - A detailed requirements specification for the application will be
    provided to the teams on the first morning - Tuesday the 4th.
  - A room will setup at the conference for the teams which will be open
    between 9am and 6:00pm. Participants will be allowed to take their
    equipment home at the end of the day as expecting people to do
    without their laptop during the evening is not realistic, along with
    the other concerns such as security and insurance.
  - Internet access is allowed. Obvious signs of plagiarism will lead to
    disqualification so please only use it for reference and help. We
    will endeavour to provide wi-fi access to all teams but prudence
    would suggest bringing your own 3G access if possible.
  - Teams are expected to produce the following deliverables to the
    judges by 6pm on Wednesday the 5th:
      - Buildable/compilable source code for manual and automated static
        code analysis
      - Working web application that is accessible to a browser and
        application vulnerability assessment tool. Networking equipment
        to create a LAN for judging purposes will be provided so teams
        just have to make sure it the application is externally
        accessible
  - We don't wish to endorse one browser over another, but in the
    interests of uniformity we will be viewing all applications with
    Internet Explorer. We suggest you optimize the application to work
    on Internet Explorer 8 or later.
  - As part of the judging process, teams will be expected to present
    and demonstrate their completed application to the judging panel,
    and answer any questions they may have. This will contribute a
    certain amount to your score. These presentation will take place on
    the morning of Thursday the 6th and should take no longer than 30
    minutes for each team.
  - In all cases the judging panel's decision will be final.
  - The organising committee reserves the right to make changes to any
    of the rules and regulations without prior notice.
  - The organising committee reserves the right to defer or cancel the
    competition due to Acts of God, health advisories by relevant
    Government authorities, or circumstances beyond our control.
  - All submitted code must be original and not infringe any copyrights
    or any third party intellectual property rights. The applicants
    agree to indemnify the organising committee and supporting
    organisations against any disputes, liabilities or damages howsoever
    arising.
  - Collaboration, copying/sharing across teams is disallowed. We don't
    mean to discourage sharing, but we need to be fair to everyone.
  - Any infringement of the rules and regulations by any team members
    may result in the disqualification of the whole team.
  - No substitution of team members is allowed once the competition
    starts.
  - All team members must be present throughout the competition.
  - Collaboration, copying/sharing across teams is disallowed.

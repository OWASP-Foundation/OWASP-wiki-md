For the third year in a row, the Portland OWASP chapter is proud to host
our information security training day\! This is be an excellent
opportunity for those interested to receive top quality information
security and application security training for prices far lower than
normally offered. It's also a great chance to network with the local
infosec community and meet those who share your interests.

OWASP Portland 2018 Training Day will be **October 3, 2018.** See
[Details](#Details "wikilink") for more info.

<span style="color:red">General registration is open on September 1,
2018. If you have recently donated to the OWASP Portland Chapter by
accident (thinking you have registered for a course), we will issue you
a refund. When registration is open, you should be able to select the
available courses you want to take.</span>

# Courses

Courses will be held in two tracks: four in the morning session, and
four in the afternoon session. Each participant can register for one
morning course, or one afternoon course, or one of each.

## Morning Session 8:30 AM - Noon

### Intro to Hacking Web 3.0

#### Sponsored by Security Innovation

*Instructor: Mick Ayzenberg*

Abstract: In this half day course, we will introduce several emerging
Blockchain concepts such as Web 3.0, smart contracts, and decentralized
applications (DApps). You will get the opportunity to explore and
interact with applications on this platform, and will be introduced to
several of the most common vulnerability categories found in smart
contracts through a capture the flag platform. This class will be highly
interactive, so bring a laptop. No previous Blockchain experience
required.

### Introduction to Computer Forensics

*Instructor: Kris Rosenberg*

Abstract: It’s 3AM and the phone rings… ok, maybe not 3AM, but you get
the call that a computer system on your network is acting strange. After
taking a look you realize that this system may be infected with malware,
or possibly you have an active intruder inside your network. What do you
do next? This session will guide you through the basic initial steps
that can be taken in a security incident to effectively isolate and
contain the attack and collect evidence for potential future
prosecution. We will introduce the PICERL framework for incident
handling and discuss each phase in detail: Planning, Identification,
Containment, Eradication, Recovery, and Lessons Learned. At the end of
the session you should have a basic understanding of how to respond to a
potential security incident, and preserve any evidence that may be
needed.

### Intro to Practical Internal Vulnerability Scanning

#### Sponsored by Summit Security Group, LLC

*Instructor: Patterson Cake*

Abstract: If your organization has the resources to scan all of the
things all of the time, this course may not be for you\! If, however,
you are like most organizations, struggling to keep up and to make
tangible progress towards improving your security posture, read on\! In
this course, we'll discuss scanning tools and techniques to help you
identify unknown devices, sensitive data exposure, and system
misconfigurations within your environment, using open-source and
built-in tools, like Nmap and PowerShell, along with some good
old-fashioned NI (Natural Intelligence). We'll focus on practical,
tactical ways to find things like unapproved IoT devices on your
network, sensitive data shares with "Everyone" permissions, and web apps
with default credentials, things you care about which are often easy to
remediate but may not show up on traditional vulnerability or compliance
scans.

Prerequisites: Laptop capable of running a recent version of Nmap
(Windows, Linux or Mac) with admin/root privileges.

### Incident Handling in Cloud Environment - a primer

#### Sponsored by ForgeRock

*Instructor: Derek Hill*

Abstract: Have you ever wondered what it takes to investigate an
incident inside your company network? What about your assets stored in a
public cloud? When does an event become an incident? Who decides this?
We will cover the important steps of an incident handling process,
including getting you started in creating your own incident handling
plan. We will talk about the challenges of doing this in cloud, where
you don't have physical access to the machines. You will walk away with
an understanding of the fundamental steps of incident handling as well
as some examples of what to look for, how to handle collection and
preservation of evidence.

## Afternoon Session: 1:30 PM - 5:00 PM

### Advanced Application Security Testing

#### Sponsored by New Relic

*Instructor: Timothy Morgan*

Abstract: This course takes students beyond the most basic web
application exploitation scenarios, focusing on advanced SQL injection,
XML eXternal Entities (XXE) and server-side request forgery (SSRF)
attacks. The course also covers out-of-band detection and exfiltration
using the DNS, which has recently become a popular technique used by
penetration testers.

### AppSec Testing Beyond Pen Test

*Instructor: Bhushan Gupta*

Abstract: Most web application security testing efforts are concentrated
around penetration testing, which is an art based on hackers’ psyche,
thought process, and determination to exploit software vulnerabilities.
However, does it yield a high level of confidence and sense of security
in a developer’s mind? The web application developers must begin to
think of building security throughout the software development life
cycle (SDLC). This workshop paper focuses on an approach that aligns the
web application security testing with the three basic principles of
security; confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA). Using a
simple approach, workshop teaches how to identify the most vulnerable
processes in an application, highlighting the test-intensive areas. The
students will learn:

1.  How to identify the security requirements for their business
2.  How to plan security testing using both statics and dynamic code
    analysis
3.  How to apply STRIDE model to evaluate critical web application
    components
4.  How to prioritizing vulnerabilities based upon DREAD model to
    minimize breech impact

### Applied Physical Attacks on Embedded Systems, Introductory Version

*Instructor: Joe FitzPatrick*

Abstract: This workshop introduces several different relatively
accessible interfaces on embedded systems. Attendees will get hands-on
experience with UART, SPI, and JTAG interfaces on a MIPS-based wifi
router. After a brief architectural overview of each interface, hands-on
labs will guide through the process understanding, observing,
interacting with, and exploiting the interface to potentially access a
root shell on the target.

### Advanced Custom Network Protocol Fuzzing

#### Sponsored by Oracle Cloud Infrastructure

*Instructor: Joshua Pereyda*

Abstract: Get hands on experience writing custom network protocol
fuzzers. This class will cover the basics of network protocol ""smart
fuzzing."" Exercises will utilize the open source network protocol
fuzzing framework, boofuzz. Attendees will gain practice reverse
engineering a network protocol, implementing and iterating on a custom
fuzzer, and identifying vulnerabilities. After the course:

1.  You will know the basics of fuzzing.
2.  You will know how to write custom network protocol fuzzers using
    state of the art open source tools.
3.  You will have hands on experience with this widely-discussed but
    still largely mysterious test method.

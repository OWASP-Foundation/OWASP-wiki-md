<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Android users face many threats and risks. Since modern mobile devices are almost all the time exposed to the internet and other types of mobile networks, they are more exposed to the attacks. From the open WiFi networks that can be spoofed to the Trojan malware applications on the app stores, threats are everywhere around. Many of the attacks are successful because users are not aware of the risks and threats. They may act naive and expose themselves to the attacks even more. These attacks may lead to the identity theft, money theft, losing privacy or they devices may start acting as part of the botnet network.</p>
<p>In order to prevent attacks on the users, this project aims to develop a set of guidelines and application that will ensure that users are using their devices in a secure manner. Project is and always will remain open for everyone to participate and all project deliverables will be free and open source.</p>
<p>Project development is done on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/nikolamilosevic86/owasp-seraphimdroid">https://github.com/nikolamilosevic86/owasp-seraphimdroid</a></p>
<p>Release of OWASP Seraphimdroid is available on Google Play: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.owasp.seraphimdroid">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.owasp.seraphimdroid</a></p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>The aim of this project is to research all threats and risks for users of Android operating system. We want to develop, as a community an free and open source security and privacy protection application and a set of security guideline for Android users. The project tend to be research oriented and we are willing to innovate in Android security field using machine learning, heuristics and other innovative techniques in order to protect our users, their privacy and money. The project is community driven and everyone is open to participate. The main aim of OWASP SeraphimDroid application should keep user data and money safe.</p>
<p>So far the main features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Permission scanner. Permission scanner will show you the list of all installed application and the permission they are using. Also app will describe potential malicious use of certain permissions. Seraphimdroid is using machine learning in order to predict whether application might be malicious (be a virus, Trojan, worm, rootkit, etc) or not and will notify the user.</li>
<li>Application and service locker. With OWASP Seraphimdroid, user may lock access to certain or to all of your applications and system services (WiFi, network, BlueTooth) with password</li>
<li>Install lock. This feature can lock all installing and uninstalling action on your device. Great for parental control.</li>
<li>Outgoing call and SMS blocker. This feature will allow user to perform normally outgoing calls and SMS, but it will block outgoing calls and inform about outgoing SMS performed by trojan applications.</li>
<li>Geo-fencing. This feature allows user to set a location range where the device should be. If the device exits the range it may set up alarm or start sending messages to the defined number with its location.</li>
<li>Remote location. If user lost your phone, he is able to send SMS with a defined secret code as a content and his phone and it will reply with the location coordinates of the device.</li>
<li>Remote lock and lock</li>

# Features and Functionalities

## OWASP Seraphimdroid is

  - Android application
  - Open source
  - Completely free (no paid for 'Pro' version)
  - Community based, with involvement actively encouraged
  - Under active development by an international team of volunteers

## OWASP Seraphimdroid has two aims:

  - To protect user's privacy and secure the device against malicious
    features and threats
  - To educate user about threats and risks for their privacy, privacy
    of their data and security of their device.

## Features:

  - Permission scanner. Permission scanner will show you the list of all
    installed application and the permission they are using. Also app
    will describe potential malicious use of certain permissions.
    Seraphimdroid is using machine learning in order to predict whether
    application might be malicious (be a virus, Trojan, worm, rootkit,
    etc) or not and will notify the user. Currently, we use SVM/SMO
    model trained on M0Droid malware/goodware dataset, which performed
    with accuracy of 88%.
  - Application locker. With OWASP Seraphimdroid, you may lock access to
    certain or to all of your application with password
  - Service locker. This feature enables user to lock usage of WiFi,
    mobile network and Bluetooth with a password.
  - Install lock. This feature can lock all installing and uninstalling
    action on your device. Great for parental control.
  - Incoming SMS blocker. This feature will scan all incoming messages
    and alert user if it find in the content potential phishing
  - Outgoing SMS scanner. The application will monitor outgoing SMS and
    alert user if the some of the application is trying to send SMS.
    This is the usual scenario how malware creators earn money - by
    sending premium SMS messages.
  - Outgoing call blocker. This feature will allow you to perform
    normally outgoing calls, but it will block outgoing calls performed
    by other installed applications. Similarly to outgoing SMSes, this
    is the scenario malware creators use to earn money.
  - Geo-fencing. This feature allows user to set a location range where
    the device should be. If the device exits the range it may set up
    alarm or start sending messages to the defined number with its
    location.
  - SIM change detector. Ask password when SIM card is changed in order
    to assure that the owner of the device is changing SIM card. Perfect
    for theft protection.
  - Remote location. If you lost your phone, you'll be able to send SMS
    with a defined secret code as a content and your phone will reply
    with the location coordinates of the device.
  - Remote lock. Similarly, you may lock your device using a message
    with secret code
  - Remote wipe. If your phone is stolen, you may send a message with
    secret code and wipe all user data from the phone.

# Project/Feature ideas

**OWASP Seraphimdroid encourages students and University lecturers to
contribute to the projects. We would like to encourage any BSc, 3rd year
or master project ideas that would improve Seraphimdroid app. Project
leaders are willing to co-supervise these projects. Please contact us if
you are interested. At the end of the page are listed some of the
potential project ideas, but we encourage you to send us your ideas as
well.**

### Behavioral malware and intrusion analysis

**Brief Explanation:**

[OWASP Seraphimdroid](OWASP_SeraphimDroid_Project "wikilink") is an
Android mobile app which already has a capability to statically analyze
malware using machine learning (weka toolkit) relying on permissions.
However, this is usually not enough and we intend to improve this with
behavioral analysis. There are a number of paper in scientific
literature describing how to detect malware and intrusions by
dynamically analyzing its behavior (system calls, battery consumption,
etc.). The idea of this project is to find the best approach that can be
implemented on the device and implement it.

**Expected Results:**

  - Reviewing scientific literature and find feasible approach we can
    take
  - Implement and possibly improve the approach in Seraphimdroid
  - Test the model and provide controls to switch algorithm on or off
    and possibly fine tune it
  - Documenting approach as a technical report

**Knowledge Prerequisites:**

  - Java
  - Android
  - CSV, XML
  - Basic knowledge and interest in machine learning

**Mentors:**

  - [Nikola Milosevic](User:Nikola_Milosevic "wikilink") - OWASP
    Seraphimdroid Project Leader

### Framework for plugin development

**Brief Explanation:**

[OWASP Seraphimdroid](OWASP_SeraphimDroid_Project "wikilink") is well
rounded security and privacy app, however, it lacks some components
community can provide. We would like to provide community the way to
develop plugins that can add features to OWASP Seraphimdroid app.
However, the way of integrating external components into Android app may
be challenge. The way of presenting GUI and integration between
processes need to be examined and developed.

**Expected Results:**

  - Examining the way of integrating third party apps through some
    provided API to OWASP Seraphimdroid
  - Providing GUI integration with third party components
  - Develop at least one test plugin
  - Document the development process and API

**Knowledge Prerequisites:**

  - Java
  - Android
  - CSV, XML

**Mentors:**

  - [Nikola Milosevic](User:Nikola_Milosevic "wikilink") - OWASP
    Seraphimdroid Project Leader

### As of SeraphimDroid, the priorities are:

  - MVP development of Android security application with educational
    content
  - Documenting approaches taken during the development
  - Try to publish some papers
  - Further development and improvement

**Involvement in the development and promotion of SeraphimDroid is
actively encouraged\! You do not have to be a security expert in order
to contribute.**

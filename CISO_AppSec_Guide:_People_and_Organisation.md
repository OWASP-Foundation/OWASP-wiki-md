## V-2 Organisation

### Organisation Structures Variance

In order to analyse what would be good and effective organisation
structures, it is useful to analyse the different dimensions of various
best practices and their success criteria, strengths and weaknesses.
Organisation Structures can vary greatly from one organisation to the
other. And further reviews did show that even if functions my carry the
same name, they may still not actually carry the same responsibilities,
capabilities or capacites.

Such criteria for organisational structures can be based on

  - historical reasons (e.g which department first started to care about
    Security or simple political calculations).
  - company culture (what organisational structure fits best with the
    company culture)
  - individual leader’s abilities and preferences (often if some
    department leader has a background in one specific area, that may be
    randomly added into the security functions and equally if the leader
    is sceptical about some areas, he may decide to leave such functions
    separately...

### Frameworks: Organization Design Principles

Synergies

  - Maximise synergies with related functions
  - Customer Value
  - Avoid conflicts of interest

<!-- end list -->

  - influenced by history and personal strengths of some of the managers
  - more mature organizations less concerned with conflicts (as these
    can be resolved through other means), more oriented towards
    organizational synergies…

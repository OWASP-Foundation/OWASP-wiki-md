## Update

Unfortunately, we were not able to raise enough funds to facilitate
remote participation for the 2013 Project Summit. It is certainly an
aspect of our summits that we find incredibly important, and we will
work hard to make sure remote participation is an option our
contributors have in 2014.

## Notes

Remote participation will be key for the success of this Projects
Summit.

Ideally we should should have 10x remote attendees (vs local attendees),
since that allows project leaders, contributors and users that cannot
make it to the conference (or will arrive late) to also participate.

What would be really interesting is if the physical presence is the
'enabler' for the wide participation and deliverables. In fact we might
find that the most important attendees might be remote

Starting with the basics here is what will be needed:

  - Good Internet connectivity (ideally dedicated, but that will have
    further costs)
  - Local moderators
  - Streaming technology (in both video, audio and text)
  - Sharing tools (virtual docs, whiteboards,etc..)
  - Registration system for remote participates
  - Schedule for remote participants

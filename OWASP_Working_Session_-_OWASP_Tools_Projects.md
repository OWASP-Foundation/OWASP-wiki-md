# Working Session Outcomes

## Standardized Output for OWASP Tools

#### Explanation

For tools that generate output, it should be in a well-defined manner
(XML-preferred) so that it can be easily used as input into another
project, program, process, etc or quickly convertible into an easily
readable format. Whenever possible, a project should re-use an existing
standard (ex. ADVL, OVAL) for this purpose.

#### Rationale

The idea is to allow easier integration to encourage tool chaining,
customized report generation, adaptability into other environments, etc.

#### Voting Outcome

  - For: 25 votes
  - Against: 0 votes

## Official OWASP Code Repository

#### Explanation

Provide or arrange for one standard, managed, OWASP-controlled place for
all tool projects to maintain their source code. This could be an OWASP
branded arrangement with Google Code, Sourceforge, etc, or an
OWASP-maintained SVN server.

#### Rationale

Provides a central, standardized place for code repository that allows a
standardized way to track metrics such as activity, usage, downloads,
etc. It also provides a single point for all projects that can be linked
in with the OWASP website for ease of use and documentation for new
OWASP project developers.

#### Voting Outcome

  - For: 26 votes
  - Against: 0 votes

## Create Metrics for OWASP Project Evaluation

#### Explanation

Beyond current OWASP Project quality metrics, create other metrics to
evaluate projects by things such as activity, usability, relevance to
current standards/technologies, how well the project addresses the
problem it is trying to solve, etc. This could even include a user
review system (a la Star ratings).

#### Rationale

Existing projects are in a state of disarray that do not readily lend
themselves to OWASP Alpha/Beta/Release quality standards. Also, quality
alone is not a sufficient measure of an OWASP Project.

#### Voting Outcome

  - For: 25 votes
  - Against: 0 votes

## Make Available an OWASP Technical Writer

#### Explanation

OWASP should make experienced technical writer(s) available to projects
to review, critique and suggest changes on existing or newly created
project documentation. This could be a single full-time person or a pool
of part-time, on-demand technical writers.

#### Rationale

To appeal to more users and corporations, projects need well written
documentation. Additionally, this will help with project adoption.

#### Voting Outcome

## Standardize User Interface for OWASP Graphical Tools

#### Explanation

Create a standard UI design "kit" for tools that have a GUI that
includes:

  - OWASP logos and icons for use in applications
  - Standardized OWASP color scheme specifications
  - Human useability guidelines such as scalar sizing, standard
    shortcuts, and other UI Best Practices

#### Rationale

Bad user interface design can limit adoption of a tool and inconsistent
UI design can hurt the OWASP brand. Consistent, well-designed UIs make
tools easy to use and encourage adoption.

#### Voting Outcome

  - For: 21 Votes
  - Against: 0 Votes

votes)](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Image:Tools-working-session-vote1.jpg)

## Make Available an OWASP UI/Graphic Designer

#### Explanation

OWASP should make experienced UI/graphic designer(s) available to
projects to review, critique and suggest changes on existing or newly
created project GUIs. This could be a single full-time person or a pool
of part-time, on-demand UI/graphic designer.

#### Rationale

Most developers are not good graphic designers and make user interface
design decisions based on limited experiences. Minor UI annoyances can
inhibit tool adoption.

#### Voting Outcome

## AJAX-Enabled Web Spider/Crawler Tool

#### Explanation

A tool to crawl over AJAX pages in a JS-aware manner.

#### Rationale

More and more sites are moving to an AJAX-enabled design and existing
open-source tools do not handle these types of sites well.

#### Voting Outcome

## Re-categorize OWASP Projects

#### Explanation

As part of the project proposal phase, tools should identify the type of
tool, the intended audience of the tool, and phases in the SDLC where
the tool might be useful. In addition, existing tools should undergo
this classification process.

#### Rationale

The "Tools" heading encompasses a broad range of projects including API
Frameworks, testing tools, reporting tools, etc. This is extremely hard
to navigate for a new OWASP user. Classifying tools across multiple
headings would also allow the OWASP site to highlight projects or to
create a "How Can OWASP Help You?" page that direct users to projects
that are most relevant to them.

PyMultitor enables to perform multiple web requests from multiple IP
addresses by using TOR network. Adding an ability of this sort to some
of the most common attacks often makes them lethal and unstoppable.

Why? Is this limited to TOR? How can we stay safe?

Tomer will present several examples and discuss the reasons and correct
precautions recommended.

''' 18:30 – 19:15
''' ''' International Trade in Cybersecurity Products *'

Recent changes to international arrangements have the potential to
significantly impact collaboration in security communities.

“Dual-use” refers to technology that can be used for both civilian
military goals. In order to limit the export of such “dual-use”
technologies for military purposes, forty-one countries have joined
together in the “Wassenaar Arrangement” – an international regime that
guides member countries in imposing export restrictions on such
technologies. Israel is not formally a member of the Wassenaar
Arrangement, but Israel’s internal export control laws are regularly
synchronized with the Wassenaar Arrangement.

The Wassenaar Arrangement mostly affects international trade in physical
weapons, but recent changes also aim to control the export of technology
connection to “intrusion software” and “surveillance systems.”
Unfortunately, the broad language used to implement these changes could
adversely affect the sharing of legitimate security information and
products across international borders. This talk will discuss the recent
changes to the Wassenaar Arrangement and how the changes have been
implemented in various countries, highlighting the problems for
legitimate security research and cooperation and presenting strategies
for managing the legal risk presented by this regime.

''' 19:15 – 19:30
''' ''' Coffee break '''

''' 19:30 – 20:15
''' ''' Data flow analysis *'

Data flow analysis is used to collect run-time (dynamic) information
about data in software while it is in a static state (Wögerer, 2005).
Dani will show how to find real life examples of vulnerabilities this
technique.

# "Hands on Hack-A-Thon" -- Thursday 17 March 2011

Bring a laptop and be ready to have some fun\!

It's been ages since we've had a meeting and we're getting back to our
roots. Our hands on sessions have always been more popular than anything
else. We apologize that our Sep 2010 mtg was supposed to be hands-on and
wasn't. For this meeting chapter leaders DC and Eric Duprey will be
preparing some live vulnerable environments and opening things up for a
fun free-for-all. The format will be that whenever somebody owns
something, they get to explain to the rest of the chapter how they did
it. If folks get stuck, we'll provide hints and walkthroughs, etc. The
vulnerable targets will range in difficulty and should provide something
for everyone, but we'll be leaning towards beginner type material.
DISCLAIMER: pro pentesters may be a bit bored, but come along anyway.
Time permitting we'll get some advanced stuff into the mix.

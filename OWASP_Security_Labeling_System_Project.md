<dd>There are 4 labels:
</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>* Security (S).</strong> Security starts with SECURE CODING, and secure maintenance. This label is based on the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard(AVSV). Web applications will get a rating based on the Applications Security Verification levels on the AVSV standard(cursory, standard, opportunistic, and advanced).</p>
<p><strong>* Privacy (P).</strong> Security is also about TRUST. Technical security is not relevant if Software comes with hidden backdoors, and non-transparent policies. This label will require a Privacy scanning policy that may be based on the OWASP Top Ten Privacy project. Web applications must follow ethical principles of data processing and data protection.</p>
<p><strong>* Ingredients (I).</strong> Security is also about TRANSPARENCY. This condition is only possible through the use of Open Source Software. Contemporary Software is built(and linked) by many components such as shared libraries, APIs, and so on. This label is about Web Applications exposing all their ingredients, including third party code and dependencies.</p>
<p><strong>* Openness (O).</strong> Security might also be OPEN. Open security means having a fast and reliable IT security team. This label consists on a scanning policy based on the OWASP Top Ten project, and making the scan visible.</p></td>
<td><p>valign="top" style="padding-left:25px;width:200px;border-right: 1px dotted gray;padding-right:25px;"</p></td>
<td><h2 id="implementation">IMPLEMENTATION</h2>
<p>Due to the complexity of the tasks, the Labels will be implemented 1 by 1. The first Label to be implemented is the OPENNESS LABEL. We will start with this experimental implementation in June - 2015. In the mean time we need open security promoters, to get submitted into the project's records.</p>
<p>The System provides 4 logos and 4 clauses(1 for each label). The clauses can be added before the copyright public licenses as a "license exception", or included in the warranty clause(or any other) in custom copyright licenses, license contracts, terms of services, or even privacy policies.</p>
<p>STEP 1: Get Registered into the OWASP Security Labeling system Site.</p>
<p>STEP 2: Download the label-logo(s) and paste before your copyright license, license contract, terms of service, or privacy policy.</p>
<p>STEP 3: Incorporate the correspondent label-clause(s) in a visible place within your Web application, copyright license, license contract,terms of service,or privacy policy.</p>
<h2 id="compromises">COMPROMISES</h2>
<p>- Between DEVELOPER and the OWASP SECURITY LABELING PROJECT. By including the Labeling-logos, the Developer gets the compromise of following the OWASP labeling system requirements.</p>
<p>- Between DEVELOPER and USERS. By incorporating the Labeling-Clauses, Web service providers assume a direct compromise with their users.</p>
<p>- Between OWASP SECURITY LABELING PROJECT and USERS. Users can report violations of the labeling system to the OWASP labeling project Volunteers.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">MOTIVATION</h2>
<p>After joining the OWASP community in my local chapter, I got the idea of a security labeling system. When I contacted Jeff Williams I found out that he already proposed a very similar idea few years ago. We think we can revive it. The OWASP international community has the purpose of making security visible, and opinions from different sides are crucial in order to create a practical and widely used labeling system.</p></td>

# Labeling clauses

*/\*Add these clauses on your web applications in a visible place. You
could also add them into your license contracts, terms of services or
privacy policies. If your software is licensed under the terms of a
generic-purpose FOSS public license(such as the GPL license, the Apache
license, the Mozilla license, and so on...),you might add these clauses
before the license terms as a license exception, or as additional
terms.\*/*

OWASP SECURITY LABELING SYSTEM. This Web Application is labeled under
the OWASP security labeling system with the purpose of making security
VISIBLE for everybody. THIS IS A SECURITY COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE
ADMINISTRATOR of this Web Application, and the end users. This system is
only based on trust and reputation. OWASP denies any liability, or
damage claims of any kind.

## Security Label

"File:Owasp-security-scaled.png")

SECURITY LABEL CLAUSE: Security starts with secure coding and
maintainance. This Web application is following the security guidelines
of the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard. Reports can be
downloaded "here".

## Privacy Label

![<File:Privacy-scaled.png>](Privacy-scaled.png
"File:Privacy-scaled.png")

PRIVACY LABEL CLAUSE: Security is about Trust. This Web application uses
a scan policy based on the OWASP top ten Privacy project. Reports can be
downloaded here.

## Ingredients Label

![<File:Owasp-ingredients-scaled.png>](Owasp-ingredients-scaled.png
"File:Owasp-ingredients-scaled.png")

INGREDIENTS LABEL CLAUSE: Security is about Transparency. This Web
application discloses a list of all its components and third party code,
including source code, plug-ins, shared libraries. Reports can be
downloaded here.

## Openness Label

![<File:Openness-scaled.png>](Openness-scaled.png
"File:Openness-scaled.png")

OPENNESS LABEL CLAUSE: Security is about Transparency. This Web
application is regularly scanned by a policy based on the OWASP top ten
project. Reports can be downloaded here.

THIS COMPROMISE IS VALID AS LONG AS THE WEB APPLICATION IS REGISTERED
INTO THE OWASP SECURITY LABELING SYSTEM RECORDS.

# FAQs

*' Why creating a security labeling system is important?*'

  -
    Making security more visible.
    Is a transnational and market wise solution.
    It is based on trust and reputation.
    Visual, and easy to apply.
    Different labeling categories for different purposes.

**Which security labels can I add to my Software?**

  -
    **S**ecurity label (S).
    **P**rivacy label (P).
    **I**ngredients label (I).
    **O**penness label (O).

**What is the Security label (S) about?**

  -
    Web Applications must be developed and maintained with a security
    orientation.

**Why is the Security label (S) relevant?**

  -
    Users have the right to know if web applications are secure enough.
    This is the main purpose of OWASP. Currently we propose using the
    AVSV standard as it provides a basis for testing web application
    technical security controls.

**What is the Privacy label (P) about?**

  -
    Surveillance code, missuse of personal data, and non-transparent
    policies are as dangerous as code vulnerabilities.

**Why is the Privacy label relevant?**

  -
    Users have the right to know how their information is processed and
    stored. We propose developing a privacy scan policy based on the
    OWASP Top Ten Privacy Project.

**What is the Ingredients label (I) about?**

  -
    Is about exposing all the components of your software, such as
    API's, and shared libraries.

**Why is the Ingredients label (I) relevant?**

  -
    Because it will help developers and users to identify properly third
    party code, evaluate the risks of using it,
    avoid non intentional license compatibility controversies, and so
    forth.

**What is the Openness label (O) about?**

  -
    It is dedicated to rate security. Web Applications will expose their
    vulnerabilities of the
    last vulnerability scan the public. They will have the time to patch
    them until the next vulnerabilities scan.
    The scans should be fixed in a regular basis(e.g. each week).

**Why is the Openness label (O) relevant?**

  -
    Vulnerabilities such as XSS scripting and SQL injection must be
    efficiently fixed.
    Scan policies must be based on the OWASP Top ten Project.

# Acknowledgements

## Volunteers

The OWASP Security Labeling System is developed by a worldwide team of
volunteers. The primary contributors to date have been:

  - Luis Enriquez (Copyright & IT Lawyer)
  - Jeff Williams (Computer Security Expert)
  - Mauricio Gálvez (Security Consultant - Hosting)
  - Jorge Lara (Graphical Designer)

# Road Map and Getting Involved

The priorities of the OWASP Security Labeling System are:

**(1) Create and Distribute opinion polls to different sides involved in
the IT environment**(such as software developers, e-commerce agents, IT
security firms, Cyber communities, Internet rights NGOs, lawyers, and of
course, users).

**(2) Create the most suitable methodology for the security labeling
system**. At this point seems that the best methodology is to create a
logo and a declaration. The logo must be visible within the web
application, and linked to the declaration and reports stored on the
OWASP security labeling system records. The declaration may also be
included within the web application, or as part of IT contracts,
copyright licenses(additional terms for public licenses), terms of
service, or privacy policies.

'''(3) Create a secure server in order to generate genuine certificates
for the labeled web applications. **WE ARE HERE**

**(4) Evaluate the labeling system with a voluntary Application on the
Internet.** This application will be promoted as the first Labeled
application. We would start with the **OPENNESS LABEL** If the results
are good enough, we will add the other labels.

**(4) Open the labeling system for any Application** The OWASP labeling
system volunteers will contribute to check that the system is working
properly. The labels can always be removed.

Involvement in the development and promotion of the OWASP Security
Labeling System is actively encouraged\! You do not have to be a
security or legal expert in order to contribute. Some of the ways you
can help:

  - Get into the testing program.
  - Improve the system.
  - Translate the documents to other languages.
  - Improve this wiki.

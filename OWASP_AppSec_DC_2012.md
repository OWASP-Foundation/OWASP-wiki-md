## 2 Day Classes

### **Assessing and Exploiting Web Applications with Samurai-WTF** | 2 Day | [Course Detail](OWASP_AppSec_DC_2012/Training/Assessing_and_Exploiting_Web_Applications_with_Samurai-WTF "wikilink") | Rm 203A

Come take the official Samurai-WTF training course given by the two
founders and lead developers of the project\! You will learn the latest
Samurai-WTF open source tools and as well as the latest techniques to
perform web application penetration tests. After a quick overview of pen
testing methodology, the instructors will lead you through the
penetration and exploitation of various web applications, including
client side attacks using flaws within the application. Different sets
of open source tools will be used on each web application, allowing you
to learn first hand the pros and cons of each tool. After you have
gained experience with the Samurai-WTF tools, you will be challenged
with a capture the flag event. This final challenge will give you time
to practice your new skills at your own pace and experiment with your
favorite new tools. This experience will help you gain the confidence
and knowledge necessary to perform web application assessments and
expose you to the wealth of freely available, open source tools.

### **Building Secure Android Apps** | 2 Day | [Course Detail](OWASP_AppSec_DC_2012/Training/Building_Secure_Android_Apps "wikilink") | Rm 203B

The course focuses on building secure mobile applications for the
Android platform. Students will learn about the Android security model
and platform security features. They will be introduced to mobile
application threat modeling, and learn how to apply the outcomes of
threat modeling directly into their design and development processes.
The OWASP Mobile Top 10 Risks and Controls will be covered at great
length.

After students are taught foundational information, they will learn how
to properly use the various Android components and APIs to reduce the
amount of vulnerabilities within production code. Hands-on labs will use
the vulnerable mobile Android applications provided by the OWASP
GoatDroid project. Students will learn many techniques for performing
source code reviews, penetration testing, and forensic analysis of
Android applications. Hands-on exercises represent a large portion of
the course. Each concept presented will include examples of insecure and
secure code, along with strategies for remediation. By teaching students
how to identify and exploit various security flaws, they will gain a
greater understanding of how the security controls actually protect
their applications.

At the end of this two-day course, attendees should understand how to
build secure applications, perform source code reviews, and perform
penetration testing for Android applications. They will also understand
and be able to demonstrate expertise at applying security controls to
applications for addressing many security defects. Each student will
ultimately take back with them to their workplace a repeatable and
reliable methodology for building and maintaining secure Android
applications.

### **The Art of exploiting Injection Flaws** | 2 Day | [Course Detail](OWASP_AppSec_DC_2012/Training/The_Art_of_exploiting_Injection_Flaws "wikilink") | Rm 208A

OWASP rates injection flaws as the most critical vulnerability within
the Top 10 most Critical Web Application Security Risks under the OWASP
Top 10 project. <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2010-A1>. This
hands-on session will only focus on the injection flaws and the
attendees will get an "in-depth" understanding of the flaws arising from
this vulnerability. The topics covered in the class are, SQL Injection,
XPATH Injection, LDAP Injection, Hibernate Query Language Injection,
Direct OS Code Injection, and XML Entity Injection. The workshop covers
classical issues such as SQL Injection, which is an oldie yet very
relevant in today's scenario as well as some lesser known injection
flaws such as LDAP, XPATH and XML Injection. During the 2 days course,
the attendees will have access to a number of challenges for each flaw
and they will learn a variety of exploitation techniques used by the
attackers in the wild. Identify, extract, escalate, execute; we have got
it all covered.

### **Virtual Patching Workshop** | 2 Day | [Course Detail](OWASP_AppSec_DC_2012/Training/Virtual_Patching_Workshop "wikilink") | Rm 208B

Identification of web application vulnerabilities is only half the
battle with remediation efforts as the other. Let's face the facts,
there are many real world business scenarios where it is not possible to
update web application code in either a timely manner or at all. This is
where the tactical use-case of implementing a web application firewall
to address identified issues proves its worth.

This workshop is intended to provide an overview of the recommended
practices for utilizing a web application firewall for virtual patching.
After discussing the framework to use, we will then present a very
interesting OWASP Summer of Code Project where the challenge was to
attempt to mitigate as many of the OWASP WebGoat vulnerabilities as
possible using the open source ModSecurity web application firewall.
During the workshop, we will discuss both WebGoat and ModSecurity and
provide in-depth walk-throughs of the complex fixes. Examples will
include addressing not only attacks but the underlying vulnerabilities,
using data persistence for multiple-step processes, content injection
and even examples of the new LUA programming language API. The goal of
this workshop is to both highlight cutting edge mitigation options using
a web application firewall and to show how it can effectively be used by
security consultants who traditionally could only offer source code
fixes.

## 1 Day Classes

### '''Application Source Code Analysis - Discovering Vulnerabilities in Web 2.0, HTML5 and RIA ''' | 1 Day (4/2/2012) | [Course Detail](OWASP_AppSec_DC_2012/Training/Application_Source_Code_Analysis_-_Discovering_Vulnerabilities_in_Web_2.0,_HTML5_and_RIA "wikilink") | Rm 204A

Enterprise application source code, independent of languages and
platforms, is a major source of vulnerabilities. The class is designed
and developed to focus on enterprise architecture and application
analytics to discover vulnerabilities across Web 2.0, RIA and HTML5. We
will be covering analysis techniques, with tools, for assessment and
review of enterprise application source code. It is imperative to know
source code review methodologies and strategies for analysis. The
emphasis of the class would be to develop a complete understanding of
source code analysis, techniques and tools to address top set of
vulnerabilities. Knowledge gained would help in analyzing and securing
next generation enterprise applications at all different stages -
architecture, design and/or development. The course is designed and
delivered by the author of "Web Hacking: Attacks and Defenses", ?Hacking
Web Services? and ?Web 2.0 Security ? Defending Ajax, RIA and SOA?,
bringing his experience in application security and research to the
curriculum.

### **Pratical Threat Modeling** | 1 Day (4/2/2012) | [Course Detail](OWASP_AppSec_DC_2012/Training/Pratical_Threat_Modeling "wikilink") | Rm 204B

Threat modeling is gaining traction as a fundamental application
security activity. In this class students learn about the attacks that
their applications may face and then both formal and informal approaches
to threat modeling. Using a fictional scenario, students perform all the
activities of a threat model on a complex application ? including
analyzing design documents and role-playing interviews. Students learn
about the industry standard formal threat modeling process as well as
Facilitated Application Threat Modeling: a 1-day approach to threat
modeling pioneered by Security Compass. Students will also be taught
about Security Compass?s unique source-code/design-pattern level threat
modeling.

### **Mobile Hacking and Securing** | 1 Day (4/3/2012) | [Course Detail](OWASP_AppSec_DC_2012/Training/Mobile_Hacking_and_Securing "wikilink") | Rm 204A

Students will discover mobile hacking techniques for Android and iPhone.
They will understand the platform security models, device security
models, app analysis, file system analysis and runtime analysis for
these popular mobile operating systems. This course will provide
students with the knowledge necessary to assess mobile app security
including what hackers look for in mobile apps. Hacking apps themselves
will equip them with the skills required to protect their own apps from
attacks. Students will come out with an understanding of the pitfalls to
mobile device security and the importance of developing mobile apps
securely. They will learn the concepts necessary to securely develop
mobile in your organization.

### **WebAppSec: Developing Secure Web Applications** | 1 Day (4/3/2012) | [Course Detail](OWASP_AppSec_DC_2012/Training/WebAppSec:_Developing_Secure_Web_Applications "wikilink") | Rm 204B

Web applications continue to be the frontier of wide-spread security
breaches. This tutorial will guide through development practices to
ensure the security and integrity of web applications, in turn
protecting user data and the infrastructure the application runs on.
Several attack types and risks will be reviewed (including OWASP?s Top
10), along with how the proper development practices can mitigate their
damage. Although examples covered are PHP-based, much of the content is
also applicable to other languages. <span style="color: #800000;">This
course was sold out at AppSec USA 2011.</span>

# Travel

## Traveling to the DC Metro Area

The Washington DC Area is serviced by three airports -- [Reagan National
(DCA)](http://www.metwashairports.com/national/), [Dulles
(IAD)](http://www.metwashairports.com/Dulles/), and [Thurgood Marshall
Baltimore/Washington International (BWI)](http://www.bwiairport.com/en).
All currently have available transportation to downtown DC via public
transportation, shuttles, or cab.

Washington DC is also serviced by [Amtrak](http://www.amtrak.com),
[VRE](http://www.vre.org/), and
[MARC](http://www.mtamaryland.com/services/marc/) train lines, which
arrive in [Union
Station](http://www.wmata.com/rail/station_detail.cfm?station_id=25), a
few metro stops or a short cab ride away from the convention center and
the Grand Hyatt.

If you live in the DC Metropolitan area, we suggest taking
[Metro](http://www.wmata.com) to the event. The convention center is
located over the [Mount Vernon Square/Convention Center Metro
stop](http://www.wmata.com/rail/station_detail.cfm?station_id=70) on the
Green and Yellow lines of the [DC Metro](http://www.wmata.com).

**July 24, 2019 (6:15PM-7:45PM) - A Practical Approach to Secure Code
Reviews**

RSVP: <https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Phoenix/events/262982992/>

*Presenter:* Seth Law

Location: **Early Warning**
16552 N 90th St
Ste 100
Scottsdale, AZ 85260
<https://goo.gl/maps/R8X2RdD2zr22>
**Topics**: Let’s face it, performing a manual review of someone else’s
source code is hard. It takes time, effort, expertise, and grit to
actually figure out what the application does, how the developer
implemented it, and if there should be any changes. From an application
security perspective, this becomes even more difficult because of the
security nuances of multiple languages that must be understood in order
to identify and squash vulnerabilities. On top of that, most security
reviews must be performed within a limited amount of time against more
lines of code than recommended in standard code review best practices.

After performing secure code reviews for over a decade, it becomes
easier to identify a pattern and framework to address security concerns
within code quickly and efficiently. This talk will introduce the
Absolute AppSec Secure Code Review Framework to attendees and discuss
lessons learned, code review tips and tricks, and strategies for quickly
assessing code that can be used by reviewers immediately.

**About the Speaker**:

**Seth Law** is an experienced Application Security Professional with
over 15 years of experience in the computer security industry. During
this time, Seth has worked within multiple disciplines in the security
field, from software development to network protection, both as a
manager and individual contributor. Seth has honed his application
security skills using offensive and defensive techniques, including tool
development. Seth is employed as a security consultant, hosts the
Absolute AppSec podcast with Ken Johnson, and is a regular speaker at
developer meetups and security events, including Blackhat, Defcon,
CactusCon, and other regional conferences.

**June 19, 2019 (6:30PM-7:45PM) - The Danger of Exposing docker.sock**

RSVP: <https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Phoenix/events/262095694/>

*Presenter:* Dejan Zelic

Location: **Early Warning**
16552 N 90th St
Ste 100
Scottsdale, AZ 85260
<https://goo.gl/maps/R8X2RdD2zr22>
**Topics**: Common containers such as traefik, nginx-proxy (jwilder),
Netdata, vamp, and many more recommend exposing the Docker socket within
the container. This configuration could allow for privilege and
horizontal escalation in a Docker environment. Other services, like
Portainer, could leave the entire host and other containers exposed on
the Internet. In a recent blog post, Dejan explained the dangers of
exposing the Docker Socket. During this talk he will explain the
vulnerability and demo exploiting a Docker environment.

**About the Speaker**:

**Dejan Zelic** is a Content Devloper at Offensive Security, and was
previously the Penetration Testing Team Lead at Early Warning. He enjoys

**March 06, 2018 (6:30PM-7:45PM) - 10 Mistakes Security Engineers Make**

*Presenter: Damilare D. Fagbemi, Security Architect at Intel
Corporation*

Location: **Early Warning**
16552 N 90th St
Ste 100
Scottsdale, AZ 85260
<https://goo.gl/maps/R8X2RdD2zr22>
**Topic**: Let’s face it, product security isn’t going anywhere anytime
soon. Product security increasingly occurs by the minute as software
houses build infrastructure to allow the provision of hourly software
updates. Software isn’t just everywhere, the manner in which it’s
designed is also a moving target. Considering all that churn, it’s
unsurprising that information security related roles are one of the
hottest items on the job market.But those jobs stay hot, because we just
don’t have enough people with the necessary skills. This results in a
dependence on relatively few security experts in most organizations –
and those experts often need to scale to a large number of product
teams.

How can security engineers succeed and scale effectively? To answer that
question, we peeled back the different layers of the product security
engineering role. We explored how the security engineer approaches
projects, interacts with teams, trains developers, communicates with
management, assesses business risk and tackles other problems. Post
analysis, we arrived at a set tips which we’re calling the Don’ts (and
Dos) of the trade.


**About the Speakers**:

**Damilare D. Fagbemi** is a Security Architect at Intel Corporation,
where he has the pleasure of working with talented software teams to
drive and improve product security in mobile, web, and IoT solutions. He

(OWASP) in Nigeria, and a former Co-founder of verdeinfotech.com, a web
development consultancy. He enjoys writing and blogs at edgeofus.com.
When he’s not stuck in a computer, he can be found exploring nature and
trying to stay active without a fitness tracker.

**July 12, 2017 (6:30PM-7:45PM) - Weaponizing Machine Learning: Humanity
Was Overrated Anyway**

**Presenter: Dan Petro & Ben Morris**

Location: **Early Warning**
16552 N 90th St
Ste 100
Scottsdale, AZ 85260
<https://goo.gl/maps/R8X2RdD2zr22>
**Topic**: At risk of appearing like mad scientists, reveling in our
latest unholy creation, we proudly introduce you to DeepHack: the
open-source hacking AI. This bot learns how to break into web
applications using a neural network, trial-and-error, and a frightening
disregard for humankind.

DeepHack can ruin your day without any prior knowledge of apps,
databases… or really anything else. Using just one algorithm, it learns
how to exploit multiple kinds of vulnerabilities, opening the door for a
host of hacking artificial intelligence systems in the future.

This is only the beginning of the end, though. AI-based hacking tools
are emerging as a class of technology that pentesters have yet to fully
explore. We guarantee that you’ll be either writing machine learning
hacking tools next year, or desperately attempting to defend against
them.

No longer relegated just to the domain of evil geniuses, the inevitable
AI dystopia is accessible to you today\! So join us and we’ll
demonstrate how you too can help usher in the destruction of humanity by
building weaponized machine learning systems of your own… unless time
travelers from the future don’t stop us first.

Location: **Early Warning**
16552 N 90th St
Ste 100
Scottsdale, AZ 85260
<https://goo.gl/maps/R8X2RdD2zr22>
**Topic**: Security testing is difficult, no matter who is doing it or
how it is performed. Both the security and development industries still
struggle to find reliable solutions to identify vulnerabilities in
custom code, but sometimes make things harder than they should be.

This talk will address the current limitations of security unit-testing
applications with existing tools and various frameworks. It will
introduce a generic framework for creating simple security unit-tests
for any application. We will also cover review common strategies for
building application security-specific unit-tests, including function
identification, testing approaches, edge cases, regression testing, and
payload generation. These techniques will be demonstrated in Java Spring
and .Net MVC frameworks using intentionally-vulnerable applications and
cover unit-testing, Test Driven Development (TDD) and Continuous
Integration (CI) in security framework.
**About the Speaker**: Seth Law is an experienced Application Security
Professional with over 15 years of experience in the computer security
industry. During this time, Seth has worked within multiple disciplines
in the security field, from software development to network protection,

Title: **DevOps and Security - A match made (and broken) in the cloud**

Abstract: DevOps is the new Agile, allowing organizations to move faster
and deploy code quicker. Yet in the quest for continuous delivery,
security can fall by the wayside, opening an organization up to data
exposure and malicious exploitation. This talk will cover current
security research into the technology behind DevOps, examples of
failures, and how to prevent the same from happening in your
organization. Technologies discussed will include AWS, Git,
Hudson/Jenkins, and more. In the end, the presentation should help
attendees understand the risks involved in running a DevOps environment.

The Beatles once sang, "I've got to admit it's getting better, a little
better all the time, because it can't get more worse" and that applies
directly to the field application security. The successes in building
security into common application development frameworks is remarkable
and has, in some ways, made secure coding less of an effort to the
developer. While much needs to be done in this area, there are many very
positive examples of security characteristics built correctly into
frameworks. This talk with bring the positive vibe to OWASP Phoenix and
highlight that things really are getting better in AppSec - all time -
if you look in the right places."

Black-Box web vulnerability scanners, such as Acunetix, AppScan, and
WebInspect, attempt to automatically find vulnerabilities in web
applications. These tools promise to bring pentesting skills to the
average developer, and they are frequently used as part of the pen
testing process.

However, despite their frequent usage, significant questions remain. How
do these tools work? Are they effective at finding vulnerabilities? What
research is being done to improve these tools? Can they handle modern
client-side JavaScript web applications? In this talk, we'll cover all
these questions and more\!

Title: **Reversing Video Games to Create an Unbeatable AI Player - Game
over, man\!**

Abstract: “Super Smash Bros: Melee.” - Furrowed brows, pain in your
thumbs, trash talk your Mom would blush to hear. That sweet rush of
power you once knew as you beat all the kids on your block will be but a
distant memory as SmashBot challenges you to a duel for your pride —
live on stage. SmashBot is the Artificial Intelligence I created that
plays the cult classic video game Smash Bros optimally. It can't be
bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity,
remorse, or fear. This Raspberry Pi monster won’t stop until all your
lives are gone. What started as a fun coding project in response to a
simple dare grew into an obsession that encompassed the wombo-combo of
hacking disciplines including binary reverse engineering, AI research,
and programming. When not used to create a killer doomsday machine,
these same skills translate to hacking Internet of Things (IoT) devices,
developing shellcode, and more. Forget about Internet ending zero-day
releases and new exploit kits. Come on down and get wrecked at a beloved
old video game. Line up and take your turn trying to beat the AI
yourself, live on the projectors for everyone to see. When you lose
though, don’t run home and go crying to yo Momma.

Title: **Everyone hates Robocalls: Why is it so hard to stop? Speaker:
Raymond Tu**

Abstract: Today, the telephone network is rife with telephone spam,
namely voice, voicemail, and SMS spam. Spam calls are significant
annoyances for telephone users, unlike email spam, which can be ignored,
spam calls demand immediate attention. Telephone spam is not only a
significant annoyance, it also result in significant financial loss in
the economy. According to complaint data collected by the FTC, Americans
lost more than $8.6 billion due to fraud annually, and the vast majority
of them (and still increasing) are due to phone communication. Despite
various efforts that reduce telephone spam, scam and robocalls,
complaints on illegal calls have been making record numbers in recent
years. This situation is surprising, given the significant gains made in
reducing the amount of email spam. This raises the question: are there
any simple and effective solutions that could stop telephone spam? In
this talk, we will cover the existing countermeasures and analyze why
these countermeasures have so far failed at reducing the growth of
telephone spam, followed by a discussion on what he believes to be the
future direction of solving the telephone spam problem.


Bio: Raymond Tu is a PhD Student in the School of Computing,
Informatics, and Decision Systems Engineering at Arizona State
University, where he is advised by Dr. Adam Doupé. He was awarded a
graduate fellowship award from Arizona State University and has recently
published a paper at the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy
(Oakland). His main research focus is in spam and scams in the telephony
networks, and the goal is to develop simple, effective and deployable
solutions in combating telephone spam, similar to what has been achieved
in defenses against email spam. To know more information or to connect

Title: **Microservices Security - Challenges and Solutions Speaker: Jack
Mannino**

**Abstract:** Microservices offer a lot of benefits for deploying
large-scale applications, but implementing a secure architecture that
scales over time can be challenging. Services are highly decoupled from
each other as well as producers and consumers of data moving throughout
the architecture. Data contracts between services are often blurry, and
data sharing between microservices require careful consideration around
access patterns and boundaries between related services. New services
come, new services go. Some are deployed to containers, some to servers,
and some are serverless. Your developers, data scientists, and
infrastructure team are all empowered to move quickly and ship new
services. Your job is to make sure all of the above happens in a secure
and sane way.

In this presentation, we will discuss the challenges with securing
microservices and present solutions to make security a seamless and
frictionless part of scaling your architecture. Using real-world
examples of successes and failures while building a microservice
architecture, we will discuss what translates well from monolithic
design to microservices, and the bad habits you should leave behind. We
will demonstrate how to build authentication into a microservice
architecture and how to implement a granular authorization scheme that
will work effectively as you introduce new services. At the end of this
presentation, you’ll understand what separates microservices from
traditional monolithic applications and understand the problem space
from a secure architectural perspective.


**Bio:** Jack is the CEO at nVisium and focuses on building solutions to
make security and education scale in fast-paced software development
organizations. He has worked with large software development teams to
guide secure software from conceptualization to production. In his spare
time, he enjoys digging into new frameworks and writes most of his
(good) code in Scala. He has spoken at most of the other major
conferences people generally list in their bios, too.

Title: **Hacking Smart Safes: On the "Brink" of a Robbery**
Presenter(s): **Dan “AltF4” Petro, Oscar Salazar**
Have you ever wanted to crack open a safe full of cash with nothing but
a USB stick? Now you can\!
The Brink’s CompuSafe cash management product line provides a “smart
safe as a service” solution to major retailers and fast food franchises.
They offer end-to-end management of your cash, transporting it safely
from your storefront safe to your bank via armored car.
During this talk, we’ll uncover a major flaw in the Brink’s CompuSafe
and demonstrate how to crack one open in seconds flat. All you need is a
USB stick and a large bag to hold all of the cash. We’ll discuss how to
remotely takeover the safe with full administrator privileges, and show
how to enumerate a target list of other major Brink’s CompuSafe
customers (exposed via configuration files stored right on the safe).
At any given time, up to $240,000 can be sitting in each of the 14,000
Brink’s CompuSafe smart safes currently deployed across the United
States - potentially billions of dollars just waiting to be stolen.
We will also release a USB Rubber Ducky script to automate the whole
attack, acting as a skeleton key that can open any Brink’s safe. Plug
and plunder\!
So come ready to engage us as we explore these tools and more in this
DEMO rich presentation. And don’t forget to call Kenny Loggins… because
this presentation is your highway to the Danger Zone…

Title: **If you like it then you shouldn’t put a ring3 on it**
Presenter: **Andrew Wilson**
Web applications are a primary means to breaching a company’s external
network. It is a high-value goal for both malicious actors and security
professionals to gain this valuable foothold. But how do you get from
mere web application vulnerabilities to the compromise of a server?
Common testing guidelines provide you a check list of items to test for,
but very few show you how to utilize vulnerabilities to achieve testing
goals.

Everyone knows that vulnerabilities have different levels of risk; But,
what few talk about is the utility provided by vulnerabilities and how
they can be used to achieve goals. Although some vulnerabilities are
useful to note and impactful to a client, during a time gaped and scoped
engagement they may not be able to be fully utilized. However, there are
a handful of key direct vulnerabilities that can be leveraged to result
in a compromise. These vulnerabilities, along with how to find them and
how to leverage them for our needs, will be reviewed during this talk.
Additionally, common attack strategies will be reviewed that can help a
focus time and energies to maximize efforts in web server compromises.

**Title: Top Ten Web Defenses**
We cannot “firewall” or “patch” our way to secure websites. In the past,
security professionals thought firewalls, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL),
patching, and privacy policies were enough. Today, however, these
methods are outdated and ineffective, as attacks on prominent,
well-protected websites are occurring every day. Most every organization
in the world have something in common – they have had websites
compromised in some way. No company or industry is immune. Programmers
need to learn to build websites differently. This talk will review the
top coding techniques developers need to master in order to build a
low-risk, high-security web application.

**Dan Cornell, Using ThreadFix To Manage Application Vulnerabilities**

'''Dan Cornell '''
ThreadFix is an open source software vulnerability aggregation and
management system that reduces the time it takes to fix software
vulnerabilities. It imports the results from dynamic, static and manual
testing to provide a centralized view of software security defects
across development teams and applications. The system allows
organizations to correlate testing results and streamline software
remediation efforts by simplifying feeds to software issue trackers.
This presentation will walk through the major functionality in ThreadFix
and describe several common use cases such as merging the results of
multiple open source and commercial scanning tools and services. It will
also demonstrate how ThreadFix can be used to track the results of
scanning over time and gauge the effectiveness of different scanning
techniques and technologies. Finally it will provide examples of how
tracking assurance activities across an organization’s application
portfolio can help the organization optimize remediation activities to
best address risks associated with vulnerable software.

**wxFramework** **(Web Exploitation Framework)**
**Ken Johnson**
The project’s goal is to assist penetration testers in exploiting web
application and web service weaknesses. Because exploitation of
applications is rarely point and click and usually requires multiple
steps, network exploitation frameworks often fall short of the goal. The
framework is intended to assist attackers along their exploitation
journey. During this talk we will preview the new graphical interface
for the first time and demonstrate how it changes or enhances the
reasons you may wish to try wXf.

**OWASP O2 Platform**
**Dinis Cruz**

The O2 Platform is focused on automating application security knowledge
and workflows. It is specifically designed for developers and security
consultants to be able to perform quick, effective and thorough source
code-driven application security reviews (blackbox + whitebox). In
addition to the manual findings created/discovered by security
consultants, the OWASP O2 Platform allows the easy consumption of
results from multiple OWASP projects and commercial scanning tools. This
allows security consultants to find, exploit and automate (via Unit
Tests) security vulnerabilities usually dismissed by the community as
impossible to find/recreate. More importantly, it provides security
consultants a mechanism to: (a) "talk" with developers (via UnitTest),
(b) give developers a way to replicate + "check if it's fixed" the
vulnerabilities reported and (c) engage in a two-way conversion on the
best way to fix/remediate those vulnerabilities. For more details see

**SharePoint Hacking - Advanced SharePoint Security Tools and Tips    
 -Francis Brown**

<http://www.bishopfox.com/resources/tools/sharepoint-hacking-diggity/>

Microsoft SharePoint products and technologies continue to grow in
popularity and have become the core foundation upon which many
organizations have built their web presence. Unfortunately, guidance
concerning common SharePoint security issues tends to be overly complex
and often misunderstood. Ultimately this results in insecurely
configured and deployed SharePoint instances in production environments.

This demonstration rich presentation will cover our newly released
SharePoint hacking tools and techniques that security professionals can
easily use to identify and exploit common insecure configurations in
SharePoint applications. Some of the areas we’ll attempt to tackle
are:
• Identifying vulnerable SharePoint applications using public search
engines such as Google and Bing
• Gaining unauthorized access to SharePoint administrative web
interfaces
• Exploiting holes in SharePoint site user permissions and inheritance
• Illustrating the dangers of granting excessive access to normal user
accounts
• Pillaging Active Directory via insecure SharePoint services
• Attacking 3rd party plugins/code within SharePoint
• And much more…

**Appsec Design Reviews Reloaded - Andre Gironda
**The best place to start in the software lifecycle is during the design
phase.
Workflow tools exist for SDL processes, build servers,
penetration-testing activities, and many other application security
checkpoints. However, very few tools and techniques exist or are
readily available when performing application security design reviews.
The full process of application security should be agreed upon during
the design phase by the security department and all relevant
application development teams. The direction of the projects and the
patterns used in the application architectures can also be augmented
from an application security perspective.
This presentation will provide discussion around how to solve many of
these and other challenges in application security. The focus will be
on web applications that use common technologies, such as managed code
frameworks.

**Involuntary Case Studies in Data Breaches, Rich Mogull, Securosis**

It's absolutely bass ackwards, but while the bad guys constantly share
details of their exploits, including techniques, when it comes to real
incidents, actual defenders rarely talk about what worked, and what
didn't. Our entire industry is built on anecdote and the few tidbits we
can glean from press reports. Thus we, as an industry, don't link means
and methods to actual security outcomes. Without this information we're
like a bunch of blindfolded wannabe ninjas trying to catch rounds from a
machine gun with our bare hands. In this session we'll name names as we
build in-depth case studies based on publicly available information,
some of which isn't overly public. We will combine these with the latest
information from breach reports released by incident response companies
and the Dataloss Database. The session will build a picture of how real
breaches happen, which security controls really work, and which
compliance checkboxes are a complete and total waste of time.

**[Reflections on Trusting the Same-Origin
Policy](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Image:Same-origin.pdf) â and
other web+network trust issues â Andre Gironda**
In computing, the same origin policy is an important security measure
for client-side scripting (mostly Javascript). It prevents a document or
script loaded from one "origin" from getting or setting properties of a
document from a different "origin". It was designed to protect browsers
from executing code from external websites, which could be malicious.

XSS and CSRF vulnerabilities exploit trust shared between a user and a
website by circumventing the same-domain policy. DNS Pinning didn't pan
out exactly right, either. Can client-side scripting allow malicious
code to get into your browser history and cache? Can it enumerate what
plugins you have installed in your browser, or even programs you have
installed to your computer? Can it access and modify files on your local
hard drive or other connected filesystems? Can client-side scripts be
used to access and control everything you access online? Can it be used
to scan and attack your Intranet / local network? Does an attacker have
to target you in order to pull off one of these attacks successfully? If
I turn off Javascript or use NoScript, am I safe? What other trust
relationships does the web application n-Tier model break?

Dynamics, Inc. discussed what Web application security is and why it is
needed throughout the entire development lifecycle. We will discuss
common vulnerabilities in the Web application layer and why they are so
easily exploited. This session demonstrates how to defend against common
attacks at the Web application layer with examples covering Web
application hacking methods such as SQL Injection, Blind SQL Injection,
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Parameter Manipulation, etc. We will also
review how compliance and regulatory legislation such as PCI, GLBA,
HIPAA, CASB 1386, and Sarbanes-Oxley, etc. specifically relates to and
affects Web application security. Additionally, we will examine how
security throughout the development lifecycle is essential to the
security of Web application code and the protection of proprietary data.

Adam will share his experiences about how organizations can integrate
application security into all phases of the Software Development Life
Cycle, from the creation of functional specifications all the way
through deployment, maintenance, and updates. He will explain how to
"bake security in" rather than "ice it on."

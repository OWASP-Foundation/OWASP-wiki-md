## From Previous Meeting/Follow up

  - ["OWASP Mini-Summit 2009"](:Summit_2009 "wikilink")/[:OWASP AppSec
    DC 2009](:OWASP_AppSec_DC_2009 "wikilink"):
      - [Brad's
        PPT](https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/present/edit?id=0Ae9M2vJFBkqfZGZjOGJoY3dfMmM3cHI0OGN6&hl=en).
      - [Brad's PPT - Second
        version](:File:AppSec_DC_2009_OWASP_GPC.ppt "wikilink")
          - Issues (revision)we decided last meeting to add to the PPT:
              - One slide about review process,
              - A reviewers' drive,
              - What we ask to all projects
              - Maybe a PDF with all diagrams and processes/everything
                we have,
              - What we want from our community,
              - SoC,
              - We should use a methodology similar to [the one we used
                in the former
                Summit](OWASP_Working_Session_Top_10_2009 "wikilink"),
              - Projects committee should involve the community in
                determining which projects/project leaders are supported
                financially. Travel, evangelism, publication, training,
                etc.....

-----

  - Honorary memberships to be given to "active" OWASP participants
    (chapter leader, project participants, etc.). Chapter and projects
    committees to submit proposal for persons to be given membership:
      - Community's adhesion has been very limited if any - See the
        ["OWASP Projects
        Dashboard"](OWASP_Projects_Dashboard "wikilink"),
      - It seems we haven't been clear and confused project leaders with
        the distinction between "contributors" and
        ""past_leaders_special_contributions" - Action must be taken.
      - We need to add a column in the ["OWASP Projects
        Dashboard"](OWASP_Projects_Dashboard "wikilink") to show
        "current" contributors.

-----

  - Spreading [OWASP Project Details
    Tab](:Template:OWASP_Project_Identification_Tab "wikilink") through
    [ALL OWASP Projects](OWASP_Projects_Dashboard "wikilink").
  - Waiting until we (Jason's task?) come up with revised\&improved wiki
    code to either link project with release and to consider the below
    referred,
      - Consider having a single release roadmap page that is not
        attached to a single version but instead is the summation of the
        various release roadmaps.
          - The single page is easier for project leaders to find/edit
          - The single page would show the progression of the project to
            external audiences
          - Makes the release roadmap very similar to a changelog -
            which is more useful if its in one place rather then in bits
            attached to releases.

-----

  - Committee members' evaluation process.

**18:00 Registration**

**18:25 Introduction**

**18:30 Talk: PRSSI Quirks - James Kettle**

James Kettle is a web security researcher on the Burp Suite team. He
will be talking about a prevalent but little-understood web
vulnerability, with a real example of a recent 0day in a popular web
platform.

**19:15 Talk: OWASP ZAP 2.4.0 - Simon Bennetts**

ZAP is an OWASP Flagship project and the most active open source web
application scanner. Simon is the OWASP ZAP project lead and works for
Mozilla as part of their security team. In this talk Simon will give an
overview of the new features available in the forthcoming 2.4.0 release.

**20:00 Talk: Burp Collaborator - Dafydd Stuttard**

Dafydd Stuttard is the creator of Burp Suite and author of The Web
Application Hacker's Handbook. He will be talking about a new technique
for web testing that will soon be available in Burp Suite, and which
will enable the automated and manual discovery of many types of
vulnerability that currently elude all but the best penetration testers.

**20:45 Networking**

This will probably be the only chance this year to hear about both the
new features in Burp and ZAP from the respective project leaders, so we
expect this event to be very popular - book now\!

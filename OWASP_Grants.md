## OWASP Grants

The OWASP Foundation was established to encourage and facilitate
application security projects, and one way that we do that is by
awarding grants to promising researchers. We have funded dozens of
projects to create tools, develop guides, perform surveys, and much
more.

## Current Projects

The OWASP Foundation is actively seeking proposals for a number of
different projects. Check out the
[details](Funds_available_for_OWASP_Projects "wikilink") of these
projects, and then consider applying for one of them. You should follow
the general proposal format that we have used for the Autumn and Spring
of Code projects. Please review the proposals there for ideas on how to
describe your credentials and approach. Your proposal is our only way to
judge your ability to complete the project successfully, and will be
very carefully reviewed.

## Ad Hoc Proposals

We are always willing to receive an ad hoc proposal for a project that
is not on the list. Please fully describe the project with particular
attention to the problem that it is intended to address.

## Season of Code Program

Periodically, OWASP runs a "Season of Code" effort to drive innovation
in application security. The following pages contain details of these
fun and highly successful programs.

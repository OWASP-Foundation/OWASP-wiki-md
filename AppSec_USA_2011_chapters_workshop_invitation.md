Dear Fellow Chapter Leaders,


Global Chapter Committee invites you to the Chapter Leader Workshop at
AppSec USA 2011, in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The workshop will be on
September 21, from noon to 3:00PM. Its format will be based on the
successful chapter workshop at AppSec EU in Dublin, earlier this year.


While we are still working on the agenda, it will closely resemble the
[AppSecEU 2011 chapters workshop
agenda](AppSecEU_2011_chapters_workshop_agenda "wikilink"). It will
include review of the chapter handbook, managing chapter finances, Top
10 advice, and how to cross-pollinate and cooperate among chapters. EU
event's agenda can be seen below.


We strongly encourage you to participate in this opportunity. Chapter
leaders are encouraged to use chapter funds for the travel. Chapter
leaders will get a free admission to the conference. The committee has
limited funds available for chapter leaders with limited chapter funds.


We would like to ask the following.

  - Save the date, September 21, 2011, from noon to 3:00PM, for the
    workshop.
  - Register for the [AppSec USA](http://www.appsecusa.org) Conference.
    Ask [Lorna Alamri](mailto:lorna.alamri@owasp.org) for a registration
    code.
  - Start making travel arrangements -- [hotel
    rooms](https://resweb.passkey.com/Resweb.do?mode=welcome_ei_new&eventID=3294461)
    are running out -- if your chapter has funds available.
  - If needed, ask for funding by emailing
    [me](mailto:tin.zaw@owasp.org) or [Sarah
    Baso](mailto:sarah.baso@owasp.org), Administrator for the Chapter
    Committee.
  - Start thinking what topics to discuss.
  - Stay tuned to further emails and upcoming Wiki page.


A word about funding. While we wish we could fund every chapter leader,
due to the limited amount of budget allocated for this event, we may not
be able to fund 100% to all the requests. We will have a deadline for
applying funding, and after that deadline, we will make funding decision
in a fair and transparent manner. When you apply for funding, please
highlight your past contributions to OWASP and your future plans for the
local chapter and OWASP.


We will try to have an option to participate, via Skype or Webex, for
those who cannot make it.


If any questions, please email [Sarah Baso](mailto:sarah.baso@owasp.org)
or [me](mailto:tin.zaw@owasp.org).

Best regards, Tin Zaw

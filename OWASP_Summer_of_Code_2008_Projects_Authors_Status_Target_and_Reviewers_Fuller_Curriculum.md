I currently work as a web application penetration tester. I come from a
desktop, server, network and OS background. I have a basic understanding
of code thanks to a stint with a dot-com. I have no in-depth knowledge
that would be of significance.
Most of my pen test work revolves around WebInspect and tools like SSL
Digger, Paros, Nikto , Cain and Able etc. I do some manual testing and
have recently started using JBrofuzz, Web Scarab and other OWASP tools.

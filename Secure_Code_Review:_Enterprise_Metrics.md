"Owasp_logo_normal.jpg")Developers in large organizations are
experiencing a move to a more holistic centralized management of
application source code and its review and reporting for
vulnerabilities. Presented will be the vulnerability statistics, which
were collected at various programming milestones for a range of
applications from an enterprise-wide application development portfolio.
Application vulnerabilities, which were detected using automated source
code analysis tools were stored in a centralized database and reported
back to developers and management with the intent of managing risk at an
enterprise level. Reports aligned vulnerability classes to the OWASP Top
10. The centralized view of source code vulnerability metrics are shown
to drive an enterprise approach to developing standardized security
APIâ€™s throughout the SDLC.

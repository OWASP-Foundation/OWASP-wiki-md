### PROGRAM

The agenda:

  - 18h15 - 19h00: **Welcome & sandwiches**
  - 19h00 - 19h15: **OWASP Update** (by Sebastien Deleersnyder, OWASP
    Belgium Board)
  - 19h15 - 20h15: **[Why Code Reviews and Pen-Tests Are Not
    Enough](https://www.owasp.org/images/0/0c/2015-02-24-Jim_DelGrosso-OWASP_Belgium%2C_Why_Code_Reviews_and_Pen-Tests_Are_Not_Enough.pdf)**
    (by Jim DelGrosso, Cigital)

    *Abstract:* Code reviews and penetration tests are excellent
    techniques for finding defects in software. But there is a whole
    class of defects that they are not good at finding - flaws. Jim will
    briefly talk about the differences between bugs and flaws, will
    describe a technique to help identify flaws, and talk about the work
    being done as part of the IEEE Center for Secure Design to help
    people avoid common flaws.
    *Bio:* **Jim DelGrosso** is a Principal Consultant at Cigital with
    over 30 years of experience working for software development and
    consulting organizations. At Cigital, Jim heads up the Architecture
    Analysis practice with the mission to analyze the architecture and
    design of systems to identify flaws and provide our customers
    contextual guidance to remediate or mitigate those flaws. Jim is
    also the Executive Director for the [IEEE Computer Society Center
    for Secure Design
    initiative](http://cybersecurity.ieee.org/center-for-secure-design.html).

<!-- end list -->

  - 20h15 - 20h30: **Break**
  - 20h30 - 21h30: **[An analysis of exploitation behaviors on the web
    and the role of web hosting providers in detecting
    them.](https://www.owasp.org/images/9/98/2015_02_24-Aurelien-Francillon-Owasp_leuven.pdf)**
    (by prof. Aurélien Francillon, EURECOM)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *Abstract:* Compromised websites are often used by attackers to
    deliver malicious content or to host phishing pages designed to
    steal private information from their victims. In a first part of the
    talk I will describe Eurecom's web honeypot, a set of deliberately
    vulnerable web applications that are regularly compromised by real
    attackers. In a second part of the talk, I will describe tests we
    performed on the ability of specialized monitoring services and web
    hosting providers to detect compromised websites and how they react
    to user complaints.
    *Bio:* *' Aurélien Francillon*' is an assistant professor in the
    Networking and Security department at EURECOM, where he is
    co-heading the System and Software Security group. Prior to that he
    obtained a PhD from INRIA and Grenoble INP and then spent 2 years as
    a postdoctoral researcher in the System Security Group at ETH
    Zurich. He is mainly interested in practical aspects of the security
    of embedded devices. In this context he has worked on topics such as
    code injection, code attestation, random number generation, hardware
    support for software security, bug finding techniques as well as on
    broader security and privacy topics. He served in many program
    committees and was program co-chair of CARDIS 2013.

`OLD BUSINESS`

AppSecUSA Leaders Meeting - [Recording](https://youtu.be/BcM3hxmiMxg)

`NEW BUSINESS`

OWASP Project Summit 2018 (AJV)

  - Seba and Dinis want to do the event without Board funding
  - OCMS event registered again
  - Considering the cost of Centre Parcs (££££££), does this leave OWASP
    on the hook - who signs for this?
  - Vote: Let Seba and Dinis go forward with planning and execution of
    OWASP Summit in 2018 without funding from the Organization and
    without the organization signing contracts.

Audit (AJV)

  - Tom Pappas to describe the outcomes
  - Items that need Board attention (timesheets, staff CC / expense
    management, and ensuring that we have visibility of pay changes
    within the ESC system)
  - Likely to sign it off once we have final draft.

Fix Project Balance for the OWASP SAMM project (AJV)

  - They have access to 6600 Euros in their EU chapter funds (Tom Pappas
    to confirm) as that's not listed in the consolidated document which
    is where I got the $0 from, but in the attachments for EU chapter.
    This is the danger of running two sets of books, and two accounts
  - Please delay until I can join (ajv)
  - They donated $10k to the Project Summit, and the rest on travel,
    which is perfectly fine as it uses OWASP funds for mission.
  - The project asks for the return 3677.22 USD to the SAMM project
    funds removed on 2-Jan-2017 as per the Board's Fund recovery vote on
    October 2015. No budget was received.
  - see email

Clarification of reimbursement approval process (Matt Tesauro)

  - Budget owners approve reimbursements in the new OWASP Service Desk
    system. I've been approving staff reimbursements, so who approves my
    reimbursement requests?
      - I'd suggest the board chairman or treasurer should do the
        approval. These should be infrequent.

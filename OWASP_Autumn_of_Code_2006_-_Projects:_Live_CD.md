## Background and Motivation

**History Behind Project** Concieved after discussions between Eoin and
Josh regarding a the need for a Live CD for Application security & RFID.
Eoin & Josh agreed to build a Live CD for OWASP as it seemed a good
vehicle for OWASP tools and the OWASP Guide documentation

**Problem to be Addressed** Build a stable Morphix based Live CD to
support OWASP deliverables.

**Benefit to OWASP Members and Community** A Physical artifact from
OWASP that can be used in the development and testing of web
applications. It is in effect a security environment that boots from a
CD.

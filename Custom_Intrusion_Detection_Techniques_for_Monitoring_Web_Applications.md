"Owasp_logo_normal.jpg")This talk will discuss leveraging in-house
specific architecture knowledge to build custom detection methodologies.
One of the very few advantages defenders have against attackers, at
least at the beginning, is an intimate (we hope) knowledge of the
underlying architectures and process flows for a web front. Combining
this knowledge with Netflow analysis and generation software, as well as
the Snort IDS system, a custom detection system can be built to provide
unique, implementation-specific detection. We will look at the Snort
rules and preprocessors specifically geared towards web-based protocols
including in depth technical reviews of functionality added in recent
Snort updates. We'll also look at how Netflow data can be generated
(both from network devices and servers) and how it, along with the data
from Snort, can be used to provide a broader security picture.

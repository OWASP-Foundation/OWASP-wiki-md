Some thoughts and the things I would like to do/achieve in the GIC:

To start, I like to strengthen more our work towards decision makers and
developers. It may sound simple as it is only 20 pages, but I loved the
"OWASP Secure Coding Practices - Quick Reference Guide". Simple and yet
easy to use for an industry company. The OWASP for CIO
document/presentation has potential to be equally useful. As well, I
hope we can improve and build on the AppSec for CISO guide Marco is
currently working on, at least that is something I will spend
significant time on myself.

We should also tailor a bit of our messages a bit more towards industry.
And build corporate memberships. For our conferences, IMHO we should try
to strengthen our industry related tracks and message.

In the past we missed sometimes to connect to developers (and that is
IMHO also due to the fact that we missed to connect to the industry as
the main consumer where actually most of the developers sit).

Just my 5cents. Am open, so if you have further suggestions/ideas,
please let me know.

## Talks

### <span id="TALK_0930">Fast, Furious and Insecure: Passive Keyless Entry and Start in Modern Supercars by Lennert Wouters</span>

#### Abstract

The security of immobiliser and Remote Keyless Entry systems has been
extensively studied over the past years. Passive Keyless Entry and Start
systems, which are currently deployed in luxury vehicles, have not
received as much attention. During this presentation we will share the
techniques used in reverse engineering the Tesla Model S Passive Keyless
Entry and Start system. We will discuss multiple security weaknesses in
the system including the use of an inadequate proprietary cipher using
40-bit keys, the lack of mutual authentication in the challenge-response
protocol, hardware configuration mistakes and the absence of security
partitioning.
We verified our findings by implementing a proof of concept attack
allowing us to clone a Tesla Model S key fob in a matter of seconds with
low cost commercial off the shelf equipment.
Finally, we will share our experience with the responsible disclosure of
these finding to Tesla Motors and other likely affected manufacturers
such as McLaren, Karma Automotive and Triumph Motorcycles as they all
use the same system developed by Pektron.

#### Bio

Lennert Wouters is a PhD researcher at the Computer Security and
Industrial Cryptography (COSIC) research group at KU Leuven. His
research interests involve hardware security of connected embedded
devices and side channel attacks.

### <span id="TALK_1015">Weaknesses in our voice communications network: from Blue Boxing to VoLTE by Ralph Moonen</span>

#### Abstract

Voice over 4G, or VoLTE, brings back the phreaking 80's. Once again,
after 3 decades, the signaling path of telephony is accessible to end
users. No more R1, R2, C4 or C5 however: we now have SIP. As it turns
out, the implementations of SIP and VoLTE in various European providers'
4G infrastructures, open up a host of possibilities. During our research
over the past few years we have identified vulnerabilities in
implementations such as txt message spoofing, subscriber enumeration,
location determination (leakage of cell-ID and LAC), IMEI leakage and a
potential SIM-card sharing attack.
During this talk we will begin with a little historic stroll of phone
phreaking through notable events and discoveries over the years.
Bridging the narrative over the last few decades, new technologies such
as VoIP, Volte, and VoWiFi are introduced, explaining the 4G and VoLTE
infrastructure components and protocols. Next, on a rooted Android
phone, we will show what control the user has over the VoLTE stack using
some standard tools and the IPv6 stack. This includes hidden activities
in Android and extraction of IPsec keys from the VoLTE stack. We will
show that it is possible to import keys to Wireshark and monitor the
IPv6 SIP traffic and components. Finally, examples of the
vulnerabilities in implementations such as txt message spoofing,
subscriber enumeration, location determination (leakage of cell-ID and
LAC), IMEI leakage and a potential SIM-card sharing attack will be
explained.
Yes, a slightly technical nugget of knowledge, yet very accessible and a
lot of fun\!

**Importance of presentation for involved audience**
The phone systems of the world have always been of interest to everyone:
from users who expect privacy, to intelligence agencies who want access.
The privacy, integrity and confidentiality of voice communications over
telecommunication networks is therefore of interest to anyone who uses
mobile phones (i.e.: everyone). It is also typically a closed subject
with very little research being done, relative to other security topics
such as malware and application vulnerabilities. The combination of
little research and high impact on everyone, makes that this topic
deserves much more attention than it currently does. The VoLTE
weaknesses we will describe are implementation dependent, and largely
unpublished (i.e. new).

### <span id="TALK_1130">When Serverless Met Security… Serverless Security & Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS) by Niels Tanis</span>

#### Abstract

Serverless is a design pattern for writing scalable applications in
which Functions as a Service (FaaS) is one of the key building blocks.
Every mayor Cloud Provider has got his own FaaS available. On Microsoft
Azure there is Azure Functions, AWS has got Lambda and Cloud Functions
can be used on the Google Cloud. All of these have a lot of similarities
in the way they allow developers to create small event driven
services.
From security perspective there are a lot of benefits when moving to a
serverless architecture. There is no need to manage any of the machines
and the underlying infrastructure. Dealing with updates, patches and
infrastructure is the responsibility of the platform provider. FaaS are
short lived processes which will be instantiated and destroyed in a
matter of milliseconds making it more resilient to denial-of-services
(DoS) and also makes it harder to attack and compromise.
But will all of this be sufficient to be ’secure’ or should we be
worried about more? With serverless there is still a piece of software
that will be developed, build, deployed and executed. It will also
introduce a more complex architecture with corresponding attack surface
which also makes it hard to monitor. What about the software supply
chain and delivery pipeline? There still will be a need to patch your
software for vulnerabilities in code and used 3rd party libraries. In
this talk we will identify the security area’s we do need to focus on
when developing serverless and define possible solutions for dealing
with those problems.

### <span id="TALK_1215">OWASP Zap by David Scrobonia</span>

#### Abstract

Intoducing security testing tools to a QA or developers workflow can be
difficult when the tools aren't easy or intuitive to use. Even for
security professionals, the friction of cumbersome security tooling can
prevent them from getting the most from a tool or being effective with
their time.
The OWASP ZAP team is working to help enable developers, QA, and hackers
alike with the ZAP Heads Up Display, a more user friendly way to engage
with the security testing tool. The Heads Up Displays integrates ZAP
directly in the browser providing all of the funcitonality of the tool
via a heads up display. The goal is to make ZAP more accessible and
enabling users, especially developers, to integrate security in their
daily workflows.
This talk will discuss the importance of usable tools, design tradeoffs
made to improve usability, the various browser technologies powering the
HUD, and how you can start hacking with a heads up display.

### <span id="TALK_1400">Juice Shop: OWASP's most broken Flagship by Björn Kimminich</span>

#### Abstract

OWASP Juice Shop is an intentionally insecure webapp for security
trainings written entirely in Javascript which encompasses the entire
OWASP Top Ten and many more severe security flaws. In this talk, you'll
learn about this open-source project and its capabilities first-hand
from its creator. Join a “happy shopper round trip,” enjoy a hacking
demo of some of the built-in challenges, witness how to re-theme the
Juice Shop into a security awareness booster for your own company, and
learn how to set it up for a capture-the-flag (CTF) event in less than 5
minutes\!

#### Bio

Björn Kimminich is responsible for global IT architecture and
application security at Kuehne + Nagel. On the side, he gives IT
security lectures at the non-profit private university Nordakademie.

### <span id="TALK_1445">Leaky Processors: Stealing Your Secrets with Foreshadow by Jo Van Bulck</span>

#### Abstract

For decades, memory isolation has been one of the key principles of
secure system design. The recent wave of speculative execution attacks,
including Meltdown, Spectre, and Foreshadow abruptly showed, however,
that performance optimizations in modern processors fundamentally
undermine application security.
This talk will review how speculative execution attacks work. What makes
them dangerous, and why they require a paradigm shift in the way we
think about application security. The talk will have a special focus on
the recently disclosed Foreshadow CPU vulnerability, which led to a
complete collapse of state-of-the-art Intel SGX technology, and
necessitated hardware and software patches for all major operating
systems and virtual machine hypervisors.

#### Bio

Jo Van Bulck is a PhD researcher at imec-DistriNet, KU Leuven, where he
investigates hardware-level trusted computing from an integrated attack
and defense perspective. His work resulted in a.o., the high-impact
Foreshadow CPU vulnerability announced in August 2018, and several
open-source secure processor prototypes.

### <span id="TALK_1600">Fast forwarding Mobile Security with the MSTG by Jeroen Willemsen</span>

#### Abstract

After the startup of the mobile security project in 2010, the mobile
security project and its testing guides have seen quiet some evolution.
All of this changed quiet intensively when, in 2016, the Mobile
Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS) and the Mobile
Application Security Testing Guide (MSTG) were created. Now, two years
fast forward: where are we now? How can you use it as a pentester or a
developer? We will start with introducing the current state of the MSTG
and its side-projects and then show various demos on iOS.

#### Bio

Jeroen Willemsen is a Principal Security Architect at Xebia. With a love
for mobile security, he recently became one of the projectleaders for
the OMTG project (MASVS & MSTG). Jeroen is more or less a jack of all
trades with interest in infrastructure security, risk management and
application security.

### <span id="TALK_1645">Lessons From The Legion (The OWASP BeNeLux Remix) by Nick Drage</span>

#### Abstract

Look at your job, your colleagues, your industry. Very smart people,
working very hard... and yet it feels like we're losing.

*Why?*

Cyber security has always been a technology driven, engineer led
industry - self-taught practitioners have chosen tactics and point
solutions based on what fits in with their preferred ways of working and
studying. We need better strategies to make use of those tactics. We can
learn those strategies from other contexts and conflicts to improve our
own methods and practices.

*Would you like to start winning?*

#### Bio

Nick is the Director of Path Dependence Limited, and has over two
decades of experience in the cyber security field… previously he was
"SecOps” before the term was invented, as well as having been a
SysAdmin, PCI QSA, pre-sales analyst, CHECK Team Leader, and various
other less well defined roles. Nick is currently a Cyber Security
Consultant and Penetration Tester, with occasional forays into being a
Wargame Umpire, Adversarial Analyst, or Professional Wildcard.

### <span id="CyberWayFinder">Women in cybersecurity (CyberWayFinder)</span>

OWASP BeNeLux and CyberWayFinder would like to invite you to a
**breakfast with other women in cybersecurity**.
Since women make up 7% of the cybersecurity work force, they are a rare
breed, and don't often meet each other. That is why "women in
cybersecurity breakfasts" are popping up in conferences around the
world. A small gathering with the women who will be present at our OWASP
conference in the morning provides an excellent network opportunity to
meet one another. We'll make sure you don't start out the day on an
empty stomach, and provide you with some contacts, without missing out
on the rest of the conference.
join us as of 08h30 at Lamot conference center, and also hear about the
CyberWayFinder training program which is being created to help women
transition their career into cybersecurity.

'''ABSTRACT:: ''' The OWASP Top Ten provides a powerful awareness
document for web application security. The OWASP Top Ten represents a
broad consensus about what the most critical web application security
flaws are. Project members include a variety of security experts from
around the world who have shared their expertise to produce this list.
There are currently versions in English, French, Japanese, Korean and
Turkish. A Spanish version is in the works. We urge all companies to
adopt this awareness document within their organization and start the
process of ensuring that their web applications do not contain these
flaws. Adopting the OWASP Top Ten is perhaps the most effective first
step towards changing the software development culture within your
organization into one that produces secure code.

In this meeting, we will discuss the new release of OWASP Top Ten
(2010). More details about OWASP Top Ten can be found here:

I'm currently doing free-lance web work and am learning the various
aspects of application security as it applies to Ruby on Rails.

I graduated from Oregon State University with a degree in Botany, an
option in Plant Molecular Genetics and Biotechnology with a minor in
Chemistry. I've involved with various aspects of computers from
refurbishing donated equipment in high school to various Computer
Science courses at the university level. I am interested in the
applications where biological sciences and technology meet such as
genomics/proteomics and biological simulations. I have written a few
database applications using Microsoft Access/Excel, PHP/mySQL and Ruby
on Rails.

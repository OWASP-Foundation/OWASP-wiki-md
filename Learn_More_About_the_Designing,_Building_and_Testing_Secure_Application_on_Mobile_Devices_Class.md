**Abstract:** This course provides an introduction to security for
mobile and smartphone applications. It walks through a basic threat
model for a smartphone application. This threat model is then used as a
framework for making good decisions about designing and building
applications as well as for testing the security of existing
applications. Examples are provided for both iOS (iPhone and iPad) and
Android platforms and sample code is provided to demonstrate mobile
security assessment techniques. Particular emphasis will be on the
unique security challenges that developing software for mobile devices
represent, comparing mobile software security concepts to those in the
web application world.

**Trainer Bio:** Denim Group Principal, Dan Cornell, has been developing

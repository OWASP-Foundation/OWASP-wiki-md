This page is split in 2 parts.
The first part is the split-up of the current goals in tasks. Here you
can add who is working on what module together with the status on
progress.
The second part lists longer term goals of the Eduction project. Do not
hesitate to add goals and discuss them in the mailing list.

## Sub Goal 4: Track try-outs (20%)

In further stages the tracks can be piloted on 'victim' audiences.

  - Feedback forms will be necessary to capture structured feedback
    (100% - Seba: template created)
  - (parts) of modules will need corrections (0% - volunteers needed)

## Sub Goal 5: Track Distribution

To support further evolution of the existing tracks:

  - Teach the teacher sessions can be set up
  - Webinars can be created
  - Figure out a way to accompany module with audio/video support (0% -
    tbd)

# Future Goals

When we get here, we can say that the project reached Beta Status and we
should define goals to get it to Release Quality.

  - Define other tracks

:\* 2 h awareness track

:\* 4h What testers should know on Web Application Security track

:\* ...

  - Set up and maintain improvement cycles for existing tracks
  - Further support OWASP and other organisations to (re)use the OWASP
    Education Modules and Tracks
  - Set up certification mechanisms for trainers and attendees
  - Define a broader curriculum ...

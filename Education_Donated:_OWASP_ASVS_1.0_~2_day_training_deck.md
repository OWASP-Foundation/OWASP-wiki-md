Andrew van der Stock Donated full training 1.5 day to 2 day deck he gave
at OWASP AU 2009 to the Education Project.

I am contributing the deck to the Education Project as is - it certainly
needs help to get to a truly polished state. I think the areas that
could be improved are:

1.  It currently refers to ASVS 1.0 beta. Ensure every single ASVS 1.0
    (release) topic is covered.
2.  Speaker's notes on every single slide.
3.  Break it up into modules so folks can download and use it piecemeal
4.  Narration using SlideShare or similar.
5.  It's currently at around 1.5 days, but needs to be 2 days. More
    material or better labs need to be added
6.  Get the results up on the Wiki early and often.
7.  Ensure OWASP's standard copyright and licensing terms (CC) are stuck
    in it so if it's stolen and abused, we have a method of enforcement.
    I am releasing this to help OWASP, not for fee firms, although they
    can use it with attribution (see the CC licensing)

The Powerpoint export is here:

Coding.ppt](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Image:OWASP_AU_Secure_Architecture_and_Coding.ppt)

The Powerpoint export is a bit broken compared to the Keynote original.
It will need cleaning up if you want to use that version (not
recommended). I suggest keeping the master as Keynote, and exporting to
Powerpoint or PDF as you need.

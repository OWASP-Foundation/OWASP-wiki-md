\==Description== **Course Length: 1 Day** The course on one hand
introduces the basic security solutions provided by the Java language
and the Java Runtime Environment, tackling issues like the Java Security
Architecture and the security services of the Java Standard Edition. On
the other hand it provides a comprehensive introduction to Java specific
security vulnerabilities. Besides the presentations being continuously
updated by the latest advances in the software development industry and
the most recent achievements of our security research laboratory,
attendees can learn how to use Java security features and can examine
and correct typical implementation bugs in example source code snippets
through a number of hands-on exercises, prepared in a plug-and-play
manner by using a preset VMware virtual machine.

## Student Requirements

Students will need to bring a laptop with VMWare

## Objectives

Skill: Intermediate, Advanced

1.  The objective of the course is to provide essential security skills
    not just for security engineers but also for all programmers,
    software architects, analysts, testers and reviewers.
2.  The course raises the awareness of attendees to practical security
    problems by demonstrating the dangers of exploitable vulnerabilities
    and by giving an insight to the organized underground, the
    spam-distribution, phishing, bot-nets and all threats that are built
    on the exploitation of those implementation flaws.
3.  Attendees learn how to avoid these dangers, how to write secure
    code, how to apply architectural techniques and use applicable
    security services to increase the quality and security of software
    products in a cost-effective way.

## Questions

  - How did your team come up with the idea of writing this paper?
  - How does the security analysis of Core J2EE patterns differ from the
    Core Security patterns book? Do we need both?
  - Why did you choose the J2EE Core Design patterns and not the Gang of
    Four Design Patterns?
  - What value does this analysis have? Who is actually going to use
    this stuff?
  - How does this design pattern analysis differ from the most popular
    design-time security activity: threat modeling?
  - The analysis doesn’t have a notion of “risk” – it doesn’t articulate
    the difference between say an application on Intranet versus one on
    the Internet.
  - What are the next steps for this OWASP project?
  - How can people contribute to the project?

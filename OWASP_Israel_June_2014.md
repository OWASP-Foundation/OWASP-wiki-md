''' 17:30 – 17:40
''' '''Opening note '''

''' 17:40 – 18:20
''' **Rise of the Machines**
**Shlomo Yona, Applied Researcher and Innovation Group Leader, F5
Networks** ([online

Why we need machines to handle machine generated intel and how to do it.
We will discuss a severe and growing problem of IT/Ops/Security
professionals and exemplify concretely with a description of how we
reproduced results reported in “An Empirical Study Of Passive 802.11
Device Fingerprinting” (http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.6457) with some
modifications and use the opportunity to see how Automated Statistical
Inference can be utilized to identify spoofed MAC addresses.

''' 18:20 – 19:00
''' **Security Testing & The Depth Behind OWASP Top 10**
**Yaniv Simsolo, Senior Security Expert** ([download

OWASP changed the Top 10 List in 2013. Some new security areas are
incorporated into the updated Top 10 list. In the past few years modern
systems’ architecture and coding practices have also changed, evolved
and transformed exponentially. Relying on proven security concepts is
not sufficient anymore and therefore other approaches are required.

We will venture into the depth of the more obscure security areas now
included in the Top 10, and the reality of the security of modern
systems. The pitfalls of security tests will be reviewed and an
alternative approach for modern systems security testing will be
discussed in length.

'''19:00 – 19:20
''' **Coffee break**

'''19:20 – 20:00
''' **DDoS Attacks: Peeling The Onion On One Of The Most Sophisticated
Ever Seen**
**Eldad Chai, VP Products, Incapsula** ([download

Taking down a competitor's website can be very valuable. Unlike
Hacktivists, with generally short attention spans, or regular
cybercriminals, who usually give up when faced with adequate protection,
these well-funded attacks persist over time, and employ multiple,
sophisticated vectors. This session will review a real case study
defending against one of the largest, most sophisticated and persistent
DDoS attacks. These include: Networking Capacity, Client Classification,
Whitelisting/Blacklisting/Crowdsourcing, Challenge mechanisms, Anomaly
detection and the secret sauce...

    *Presentation + discussion:* [Cross-Site Request Forgery
    (CSRF)](Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_\(CSRF\) "wikilink") is a well
    known attack in which a malicious webpage instructs the victim's
    browser to send out requests to legitimate sites on behalf of the
    victim, while piggybacking on the authorized sessions of the victim.
    CSRF attacks are typically transparent for the victim, and for
    legitimate websites it is hard to differentiate between requests
    initiated by the victim, and requests initiated by the malicious
    webpage.
    Although this type of vulnerability is already known for about a
    decade, CSRF recently gained much more attention because of its
    impact on contemporary e-society. In November 2007, a vulnerability
    in GMail was exploited to forward incoming mails of the victims to
    an arbitrary account. In October 2008, Zeller and Felten published a
    technical report, describing CSRF attacks on four larger websites,
    including NYTimes.com and INGDirect.com .
    Several mitigation techniques are already developed, both for
    protecting the client as well as the legitimate server. In this
    presentation, I will give an overview of the possible mitigation
    techniques and discuss several of the proposed solutions.
    **[Lieven](http://www.cs.kuleuven.be/~lieven/)** received his Ph.D.
    in software security in January 2007 and is currently active as
    Research Manager on Secure Software within the DistriNet research
    group at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (Belgium). His main
    research interests are in software security and software
    engineering. In particular, he is working on software verification
    and web application security. Lieven is a board member of the
    Belgium OWASP chapter, and organized several editions of the OWASP
    refereed papers track at the OWASP AppSec EU conferences. Since
    2008, he is also a guest lecturer on web application security for
    the industry course SecAppDev.

    *Presentation + discussion:* Web 2.0 applications are becoming
    increasingly interconnected and consuming various streams coming
    from cross domains. It is very challenging to identify these streams
    and discovering vulnerabilities by fuzzing them. This talk will
    focus on understanding application architecture, cross domain
    relationships, XML/JSON stream manipulations and vulnerability
    detection. Following issues will be discussed with cases, demos and
    tools.
      - XML and SOAP poisoning
      - JSON injections and manipulations
      - XSS based on XML and JSON
      - Asynchronous injections
      - Cross Domain CSRF poisoning
      - JSON and CSRF
      - XPATH, XQUERY and SQL over JSON/SOAP
      - XML and SOAP exploits
    **[Shreeraj Shah](http://shreeraj.blogspot.com/)**, B.E., MSCS, MBA,
    is the founder of Blueinfy, a company that provides application
    security services. Prior to founding Blueinfy, he was founder and
    board member at Net Square. He also worked with Foundstone (McAfee),
    Chase Manhattan Bank and IBM in security space. He is also the
    author of popular books like Hacking Web Services (Thomson 06) and

  - 18h00 - 18h30: Welcome & Refreshments
  - 18h30 - 18h45: **OWASP Update** (by Sebastien Deleersnyder,
    Telindus, OWASP Board)
  - 18h45 - 20h45: **A Software Security Maturity Model** (by Gary
    McGraw, CTO of Cigital)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *Presentation + discussion:* As a discipline, software security has
    made great progress over the last decade. There are now at least 23
    large scale software security initiatives underway in enterprises
    including global financial services firms, independent software
    vendors, defense organizations, and other verticals. In 2008, Brian
    Chess, Sammy Migues and I interviewed the executives running nine
    initiatives using the twelve practices of [the Software Security
    Framework](http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1271382)
    as our guide. The resulting data, drawn from real programs at
    different levels of maturity was used to guide the construction of a
    Software Security Maturity Model. This talk will describe the
    maturity model, drawing examples from many real software security
    programs. A maturity model is appropriate because improving software
    security almost always means changing the way an organization works
    ---people, process, and automation are all required. While not all
    organizations need to achieve the same security goals, all
    successful large scale software security initiatives share common
    ideas and approaches. Whether you rely on the Cigital Touchpoints,
    Microsoft's SDL, or OWASP CLASP, there is much to learn from
    practical experience. Use the software security maturity model to
    determine where you stand and what kind of software security plan
    will work best for you.
    **[Gary McGraw (aka gem)](http://www.rstcorp.com/gem/)** is the CTO
    of Cigital, Inc., a software security and quality consulting firm
    with headquarters in the Washington, D.C. area. He is a globally
    recognized authority on software security and the author of six best
    selling books on this topic. The latest, Exploiting Online Games was
    released in 2007. His other titles include Java Security, Building
    Secure Software, Exploiting Software, and Software Security; and he
    is editor of the Addison-Wesley Software Security series. Dr. McGraw
    has also written over 90 peer-reviewed scientific publications,
    authors a monthly security column for darkreading.com, and is
    frequently quoted in the press. Besides serving as a strategic
    counselor for top business and IT executives, Gary is on the
    Advisory Boards of Fortify Software and Raven White. His dual PhD is
    in Cognitive Science and Computer Science from Indiana University
    where he serves on the Dean's Advisory Council for the School of
    Informatics. Gary is an IEEE Computer Society Board of Governors
    member and produces the monthly Silver Bullet Security Podcast for
    IEEE Security & Privacy magazine.

    Telindus, OWASP Board)
  - 18h40 - 19h30: **Best Practices Guide Web Application Firewalls**
    (by Alexander Meisel, CTO and founder of [Art of
    Defence](http://www.artofdefence.com/))

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *Presentation + discussion:* the OWASP German chapter has put
    together a
    [paper](http://www.owasp.org/images/1/1b/Best_Practices_Guide_WAF.pdf)
    to give a better understanding in how and where Web Application
    Firewalls should be used.
    **Alexander Meisel** is CTO and founder of [art of
    defence](http://www.artofdefence.com/). He is in charge of product
    development, professional services and support. His interest and
    expertise in the area of security dates back to his thesis in which
    he wrote about avoiding and tracing distributed denial-of-service
    attacks. He worked for a Swiss IT service provider as a Web security
    expert; later he joined LINX, Europe’s largest Internet exchange,
    where he took care of member network security issues. After working
    for three years as a senior consultant designing and implementing
    large Web farms, including security audits with a leading producer
    of web servers, Alexander switched to a SPX Corporation company,
    where he was the main project manager for Web application solutions
    in the SAP area.

  - 19h30 - 20h00: **I thought you were my friend - Evil Markup, browser
    issues and other obscurities** (by Mario Heiderich)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *Presentation:* This talk is a preview of the upcoming Poland talk
    (still in selection process). The talk will cover a short exegesis
    of how and where browser vendors talk about security - and what can
    be seen from a security professionals perspective. The ratio between
    the growth of new browser technologies and the amount of time for
    developers to learn working with them could turn out to be a problem
    - especially when knowing that todays browsers support a vast amount
    of lost treasures. Amongst them various XML quirks, data islands,
    SVG fonts etc. which make it hard to protect rich web applications.
    Surprising but true: several of the most recent in-the-wild browser
    exploits were possible due to those legacy features like the IE6-8
    code execution flaw. Reason enough to dive into a collection of
    weird techniques and standards exposing attack vectors and scenarios
    that WAF systems and filters might have some trouble with. The talk
    also shows some issues regarding IE8 and Opera 10 - as well as
    current Firefox versions. The conclusion of the talk features an
    overview of what we can expect during the next months, ways for
    developers and related parties to deal with those security risks.
    **Mario Heiderich**, is a cologne based CTO for an online enterprise
    based in Cologne and New York. He was visitor and speaker on several
    OWASP conferences, maintains the PHPIDS and other security related
    projects and recently authored a German book on Web Security
    together with Christian Matthies, fukami and Johannes Dahse. He is
    currently into browser security and digging the HTML5
    specifications.

  - 20h00 - 20h10: **Break**
  - 20h10 - 21h00: **Research on Belgian bank trojan attacks** (by
    Richard Bennett, software consultant)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *Presentation + discussion:* Richard will present results of his
    research on trojans attacking customers of Belgian banks.
    The paper summarizes the following aspects:
      - What are these 'Banking Trojans'?
      - Who creates them and why?
      - What kind of infrastructure are they using?
      - Which banks and organizations are they targeting?
      - How do these trojans affect the target PC, and how are they
        spread?
      - How can they be detected and removed?
      - What are the risks to banking and e-commerce?
      - What are the CBFA's updated 2009 recommendations, and do they
        make sense?
      - How can we further mitigate this risk?
    It is quite a high-level paper aimed to be used as input and context
    during a risk-analysis.
    The PDF will be made available shortly.

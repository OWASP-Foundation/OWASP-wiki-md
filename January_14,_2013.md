**Old Business**

  - Discuss/reaffirm 60/40 membership split (only approved for one year)

**New Business**

  - Vote Requested - move AppSec USA to Q2 starting in 2014 (Q1 APAC, Q2
    USA, Q3 EU, Q4 LATAM)
  - Board meeting meta-discussion: I'd like to suggest that the board
    meeting be run by a board member and be board driven. Current
    meeting feels like an organization update and staff meeting, not a
    board meeting.
  - Vendor Neutrality: I'd like to revisit OWASP's relationship with
    Vendor neutrality. I hope to have an open discussion with the board
    on our current policy, how we are doing, and where we need to make
    improvements.

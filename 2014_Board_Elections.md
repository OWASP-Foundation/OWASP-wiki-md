# 2014 OWASP International Board of Directors Election

The OWASP Foundation was established in 2001 as an open community and
software security resource. Since then, OWASP has grown to be globally
recognized as a credible source for application security standards (see
industry citations). Individuals typically find OWASP when searching the
internet for information about software security - and they are happy to
find a reliable source of knowledge built by an extremely open and
passionate community. OWASP is open to anyone. Anyone can attend OWASP's
vendor agnostic local chapter meetings, participate in regional and
global conferences, and contribute to the many OWASP projects. And
anyone can start a new project, form a new chapter, or lend their
expertise to help an OWASP Global Committee.

The OWASP Foundation Board of Directors currently consists of seven
elected volunteers. These unpaid volunteers dedicate themselves to the
organizational mission and playing a pivotal role in the software
security community. OWASP conducts democratic elections of its Board
Members to enable bottom-up advancement of its mission.

    articulates the organization's goals, means, and primary
    constituents served globally. They then support that mission and
    purpose.
2.  Support all employees. The Board should ensure that the employees
    have the moral and professional support needed to further the goals

3.  Ensure effective planning. The Board must actively participate in
    the overall planning process for the organization and assist in

    responsibility is to determine which programs are consistent with

6.  Protect assets and provide proper financial oversight. The Board

    financial controls are in place.
7.  Build a competent Board. The Board has a responsibility to

8.  Ensure legal and ethical integrity. The Board is ultimately
    responsible for adherence to legal standards and ethical norms.
9.  Enhance the organization's public standing. The Board should clearly
    articulate the organization's mission, accomplishments, and goals to

#### Main

**Welcome to the Forward Exploit Tool Project**

This project is intended to develop a tool to exploit [OWASP Top Ten
2010 - A10: Unvalidated Redirects and
Forwards](Top_10_2010-A10 "wikilink") vulnerability, focused in the
unvalidated "forwards".

The main reason for the Forward Exploit Tool is that there is no tool
for this fact, as far as I know. On the other hand, I have seen this
problem in several applications that I've analysed in last times,
besides this problem has been included in the recent OWASP Top Ten 2010.

## Overview

Unvalidated Forwards can be used to bypass access controls, specific or
standard access control. For an automatized tool is difficult to exploit
specific facts, but can work well with standard situations. So, the
focus is standard access control in Java applications, like restricted
directory /WEB-INF. Below this directory is all deployed application
files: binary/compiled files, configuration, etc. In Java, compiled
files (*class*) can be easily de-compiled to obtain source code.
The **impact**: compromise all files, including source code, information
hardcoded (credentials, SQL clauses, IP addresses, etc.). This is a
**high-critical impact**.

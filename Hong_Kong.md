The Hong Kong chapter was formed in December 2004. The objectives to
establish OWASP Hong Kong Chapter are mainly because: -There are many
web applications established in past 10 years. However, how many
developers know that their developed application are secure. Meanwhile,
there are many transactional-based systems, we should not ignore that
the web application is another channel for hackers to compromise one's
confidential information and interrupt any critical business operations.

\- Raise the security awareness of web application development among the
professionals.

\- Encourage professionals to reference standard like ISO7799 for their
web application security and post-deployment review as well as audit.

\- Accelerate to Share, learn, discuss and review best practices of the
experienced web application development security professionals even
across various user and security groups including VXRL in Hong Kong.

**Coding Practice**

\- Mainstream web technologies (i.e. .NET, J2EE and PHP on Linux)
security assessment

\- Web application platform (i.e. Apache, IIS, Linux, Database) security
assessment and review.

\- Recent Web application security concerns.

\- Regularly convey latest projects and presentations from OWASP.

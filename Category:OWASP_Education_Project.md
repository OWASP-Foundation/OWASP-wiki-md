<p>OWASP Education Project aims to provide in building blocks of web application security knowledge that can easily be integrated in awareness sessions or presentations on this topic. The building blocks provided by this project can then be bundled together in education tracks. An important guideline is therefore that the material produced is modular.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Web Application Security Education and Awareness is needed throughout the entire organization, each area and level of organizations have specific needs and requirements regarding education. A manager needs other information than a security professional or developer. Novices to the profession require other training than people with several years of experience. This Education project aims to provide in building blocks of web application security information. These modules can be combined together in education tracks targeting different audiences.</p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>The project will continuously deliver education material about OWASP tooling and documentation. This aims to create an easy entrance towards understanding application security and usage of the OWASP tooling. By creating education documentation papers, screen scrape video courses and setting up an OWASP Boot camp, a controlled education process of a standardized quality can be created continuously. With the setup of a OWASP Boot camp, the OWASP word can be spread in a controlled manner and deliver high quality training., both inside and outside of the OWASP community. The OWASP Education Project will setup and standardize OWASP trainings manuals and materials to ensure a certain level of quality of the trainings. Trainings about the OWASP tooling and projects will have to be reviewed by the Projects.</p>

# Resources and Links

This project is not standalone. There is an awfull lot of information
that can be found throughout this site and from other resources on the
Internet.
This project will draw pieces of information from:

  - [Videos](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Video)
  - The presentations, currently being inventorized in the
    [consolidation page of OWASP
    presentations](OWASP_Education_Presentation "wikilink")Â¨
  - [WebGoat](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_WebGoat_Project)
  - ...

One of the modules to create will be a Resources module, not limited to
OWASP.

## Educations

  - [What Developers Should
    Know](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Education_Track:_What_Developers_Should_Know_on_Web_Application_Security)
  - [Setting up a Secure Development Life Cycle with
    OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/images/8/8f/Setting_up_a_Secure_Development_Life_Cycle_with_OWASP_-_Seba_Deleersnyder.pptx)

# Donated Material

The following training material and presentations were donated to the
education project and will be integrated in future Education Tracks.

  - [Education Donated: OWASP Safe
    Browsing](Education_Donated:_OWASP_Safe_Browsing "wikilink")

# Road Map and Getting Involved

This page is split in 2 parts.
The first part is the split-up of the current goals in tasks. Here you
can add who is working on what module together with the status on
progress.
The second part lists longer term goals of the Eduction project. Do not
hesitate to add goals and discuss them in the mailing list.

## Current Goal Tasks

### Sub Goal 1: Create overview of OWASP presentations (100%)

The following is a list of tasks that have to be performed for the
project:

  - Add the majority of presentation material on [the presentation
    overview page](OWASP_Education_Presentation "wikilink") (100% - all)
  - Provide [Guidance
    page](:Category:OWASP_Presentations#OWASP_Education_Presentation_Guidelines "wikilink")
    on OWASP presentations and re-usability and link in other related
    presentation pages (100% Seba)

### Sub Goal 2: Design agenda 2 Tracks (100%)

For the two 4 hour tracks:

  - A [Web Application Security
    Primer](Education_Track:_Web_Application_Security_Primer "wikilink")
    Track for beginners (4 hours)

Perform the following:

:\* Describe track overview (100% - Seba)

:\* Describe track target audience (100% - Seba)

:\* Design a TOC with titles, one paragraph per title and timing (100% -
Seba)

:\* Perform a review cycle on the TOC and get external feedback (100% -
Seba)

:\* Finish TOC for approval by the project team (100% - Seba)

  - [What Developers Should Know on Web Application
    Security](Education_Track:_What_Developers_Should_Know_on_Web_Application_Security "wikilink")
    Track for developers (4 hours)

Perform the following:

:\* Describe track overview (100% - seba)

:\* Describe track target audience (100% - volunteers needed)

:\* Design a TOC with titles, one paragraph per title and timing (100% -
seba)

:\* Perform a review cycle on the TOC and get external feedback (100% -
Seba)

:\* Finish TOC for approval by the project team (100% - Seba)

### Sub Goal 3: Create Modules (100 %)

To support the 2 target tracks and eventually other tracks, modules will
have to be created. This means:

  - Work out some basic rules on module slides (100% - Seba)

For the two 4 hour tracks:

  - A [Web Application Security
    Primer](Education_Track:_Web_Application_Security_Primer "wikilink")

  - Feedback forms will be necessary to capture structured feedback
    (100% - Seba: template created)
  - (parts) of modules will need corrections (0% - volunteers needed)

### Sub Goal 5: Track Distribution

To support further evolution of the existing tracks:

  - Teach the teacher sessions can be set up
  - Webinars can be created
  - Figure out a way to accompany module with audio/video support (0% -
    tbd)

## Future Goals

When we get here, we can say that the project reached Beta Status and we
should define goals to get it to Release Quality.

  - Define other tracks

:\* 2 h awareness track

:\* 4h What testers should know on Web Application Security track

:\* ...

  - Set up and maintain improvement cycles for existing tracks
  - Further support OWASP and other organisations to (re)use the OWASP
    Education Modules and Tracks
  - Set up certification mechanisms for trainers and attendees
  - Define a broader curriculum ...

Involvement in the development and promotion of the OWASP Education
Project is actively encouraged\! We hope you find the OWASP Education
Project useful. Please contribute to the Project by volunteering for one
of the Tasks, sending your comments, questions, and suggestions to the
[mailing list](http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-education).

If you used material from our project, please use the available
[evaluation
forms](:Image:Education_Track_Evaluation_Template.doc "wikilink") and
let uw know how we can improve our modules and tracks.

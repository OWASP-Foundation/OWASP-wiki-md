__NOTOC__ OWASP AppSec conferences bring together industry,
government, security researchers, and practitioners to discuss the state
of the art in application security. This series was launched in the
United States in 2004 and Europe in 2005. Global AppSec conferences are
held annually in North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia Pacific.
Additionally, regional events are held in locations such as Brazil,
China, India, Ireland, Israel, and Washington D.C. Presentations and
videos are generally posted several months after each conference.

## Goal

Currently input (people / ideas) is requested to provide OWASP input on
an upcoming W3C Workshop on device API security.

The W3C workshop isn't yet announced publicly since they're building the
program committee.

Basically OWASP needs to appoint a program committee member and put
forward a position paper on the topic once the CFP is made public.

## 2016 Global Board of Directors Election


The OWASP Foundation was established in 2001 as an open community and
software security resource. Since then, OWASP has grown to be globally
recognized as a credible source for application security standards (see
industry citations). Individuals typically find OWASP when searching the
internet for information about software security - and they are happy to
find a reliable source of knowledge built by an extremely open and
passionate community. OWASP is open to anyone. Anyone can attend OWASP's
vendor agnostic local chapter meetings, participate in regional and
global conferences, and contribute to the many OWASP projects. And
anyone can start a new project, form a new chapter, or lend their
expertise to help an OWASP Global Committee.

The OWASP Foundation Board of Directors currently consists of seven
elected volunteers. These unpaid volunteers dedicate themselves to the
organizational mission and playing a pivotal role in the software
security community. OWASP conducts democratic elections of its Board
Members to enable bottom-up advancement of its mission.

[Kate's Review](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Image:Owasp_review.doc)

**IT Issues:**

1\. What to do about wiki/forums/mailing lists? (need answers asap)

  - Liferay (java based cms) -- possible hosted env.
  - Drupal -- can handle member/conference registrations
  - Ultimate BBS with mailing list integration
  - What are we using Saleforce for?

2\. Future of IT support

  - Ad server instructions are done.
  - Wiki upgrade process done, but needs continued updating
  - Mailing list needs to move to OWASP hardware (waiting on \#1 above)

Vote Required:

1\. Are we going to have a financial review for 2008. The cost is 5K.
Suggestion is to skip the annual review and have full review every 3
years.

2\. What to do with invoices over 1 year old. Send to collections? Write
off? Current balance is $2900

3\. Do we charge Local chapters processing fees for the 60/40 split.
Currently we do not. Proposal is to pass along the transaction fees too
the chapter for paypal processing.

4\. Should we invest $2500 to support an OWASP meet up at Blackhat

5\. GPC - Send 'Individual Committee Member' online form

costs.'''

## Submission Response

*Latest first*

### Final version

\[This response is submitted on behalf of the Open Web Application
Security Project (OWASP) <http://www.owasp.org/> by the OWASP Global
Industry Committee
<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Global_Industry_Committee> \]

OWASP supports initiatives to increase software visibility. Please find
below our comments on the 8 October 2008 version of "Fundamental
Practices for Secure Software Development: A Guide to the Most Effective
Secure Development Practices in Use Today."

#### Are there any best practices you feel should be added to the paper? Please explain.

We recommend the inclusion of the "Software Assurance Maturity Model
(SAMM)". This describes a range of practices through the software
development lifecycle, across four business functional areas, that help
build security into software development. The release-quality version
1.0 was published in March 2009.

`  OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM)`
`  `<http://www.opensamm.org/>

Some of the existing resources link to sections of the OWASP Development
Guide. This document and the ESAPI Toolkits, that help software
developers guard against security-related design and implementation
flaws, span more than one fundamental practice category. In view of the
need to keep the document relatively short, we wonder if there is a need
for more generic resource links, perhaps in the overview or as a new
separate "lifecycle approach" section.

`  OWASP Guide Project - Guide to Building Secure Web Applications and Web Services`
`  `<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Guide_Project>

`  OWASP Enterprise Security API (ESAPI)`
`  `<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Enterprise_Security_API>`  `

Or alternatively link to them from multiple resource sections.

#### Would you make any changes to the practices listed in any of the \[Requirements, Design, Programming, Testing, Code Integrity and Handling, Documentation\] sections? Please explain.

On page 9, add the resource OWASP Code Review Guide which includes a
strong collection of issues, practices and guidance on code review
tools:

`  OWASP Code Review Project - OWASP Code Review Guide`
`  `<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Code_Review_Project>

On page 11, we suggest the resource "OWASP PHP AntiXSS Library Project"
should be removed, and replaced with the more generic, and recent:

`  OWASP XSS (Cross Site Scripting) Prevention Cheat Sheet`
`  `<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_(Cross_Site_Scripting)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet>

On page 16, we recommend mention the OWASP Testing Guide which was
updated this year and includes a large number of additional references
and links to tools:

`  OWASP Testing Project`
`  `<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Testing_Project>

and the new Application Security Verification Standard, that defines
tiered requirements for application security verification processes to
establish a defined level of assurance:

`  OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) Project`
`  `<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_Project>

#### Is there anything else not covered above you would like SAFECode to consider in its second version of the paper?

A minor correction... on page 10, the last resource says "OSWASP Top
10..." - this has an extra S and should be "OWASP Top 10...".

On page 15, the resource item "OWASP Error Handling, Auditing and
Logging" doesn't need to be SSL i.e. change "<https://>" to "<http://>".

## Invitation

In October 2008, SAFECode released "Fundamental Practices for Secure
Software Development: A Guide to the Most Effective Secure Development
Practices in Use Today." Based on an analysis of the individual software
assurance efforts of SAFECode members, the paper outlines a core set of
secure development practices that can be applied across diverse
development environments to improve software security.

The brief and highly actionable paper describes each identified security
practice across the software development lifecycle - Requirements,
Design, Programming, Testing, Code Handling and Documentation - and
offers implementation advice based on the real-world experiences of
SAFECode members.

Due to the overwhelmingly positive response to the paper's publication,
as well as the rapidly evolving information security environment,
SAFECode will be releasing an updated version of the paper in late 2009.

In our continued effort to make the paper's recommendations as useful
and relevant as possible, we would like to offer experts outside of our
membership an opportunity to provide input into the paper's next
version. To submit your comments, please visit
<http://www.safecode.org/feedback.php>.

We will be accepting comments until July 31, 2009.

## Overview

The basic principal of how DirBuster works is with the use of "Fail
Cases". This means that DirBuster will attempt to determine what the
actual "Fail Case " is before testing. DirBuster will then determine
something (a file or directory) to be present if the test executed
returns a result different from the "Fail Case". This a very basic
example of what DirBuster does. More detailed information is given
below.

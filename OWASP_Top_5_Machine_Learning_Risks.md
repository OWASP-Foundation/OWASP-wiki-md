<p>The idea is to build the required resources which help software security community to understand the emerging technology of machine learning and how it is related to security, warn them about the risk associated with using ML, and discuss the defending techniques.</p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>Machine Learning has recently re-emerged as a powerful tool in multiple business sectors. It also becomes vital when it is harnessed for the Security services and applications like Fraud Detection, Anomaly Detection, Behavioral Analysis, etc.</p>
<p>Although these applications have huge success, there are still security risks associated with the learning technique especially the security of the learning phase; which can still be vulnerable to threats originated by potential adversaries, and consequently it has considerable impact on their prediction results</p>
<p>This project will list these risks and the defending techniques</p>

# FAQs

## How can I participate in your project?

This project requires a lot of participations from data scientists, ML
experts, software developers, risk managers and application security
specialists. Please make the Project Leader's aware of your available
time to contribute to the project. It is also important to let the
Leader's know how you would like to contribute and pitch in to help the
project meet it's goals and milestones. There are many different ways
you can contribute to an OWASP Project, but communication with the leads
is key.

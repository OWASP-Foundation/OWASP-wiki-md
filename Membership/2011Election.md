### 2011 OWASP International Board of Directors Election

The [OWASP Foundation](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/About_OWASP) was
established in 2001 as an open community and software security resource.
Since then, OWASP has grown to be globally recognized as a credible
source for application security standards ([see industry
citations](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Industry:Citations)).
Individuals typically find OWASP when searching the internet for
information about software security - and they are happy to find a
reliable source of knowledge built by an extremely open and passionate
community. OWASP is open to anyone. Anyone can attend OWASP's vendor
agnostic [local chapter
meetings](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Chapter),
participate in [regional and global
conferences](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_AppSec_Conference),
and contribute to the many [OWASP
projects](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Project). And
anyone can [start a new
project](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/How_to_Start_an_OWASP_Project),
form a [new
chapter](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/How_to_Start_an_OWASP_Chapter),
or lend their expertise to help an OWASP [Global
Committee](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Global_Committee_Pages).

The OWASP Foundation [Board of
Directors](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/About_OWASP#Global_Board_Members)
consists of six elected volunteers. These unpaid volunteers dedicate
themselves to the organizational
[mission](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/About_OWASP#Core_Values),
supporting the OWASP [Global
Committees](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Global_Committee_Pages) and
playing a pivotal role in the software security community. OWASP
conducts democratic elections of its Board Members and Committee Chairs
to enable bottom-up advancement of its mission.

Each year, half of the Board seats, and all of the Committee Chair
seats, are up for election by the then-current registered
<b>[members](https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApZ9zE0hx0LNdGRwS1BTempMWXlZYjlNbHdITEoxUmc&hl=en_US#gid=9)</b>.

    constituents served globally. They then support that mission and

"Behind the scenes: Security Research" - Rodrigo Rubira Branco
(BSDaemon)

It is well known that Security Research became a trend worldwide. Terms
like cyberwar and 0day are now part of the normal media jargon. Security
companies are releasing advisories. Computer hardware companies are
buying security companies. Software companies are hiring hackers. How
does that work behind the scenes? How good (or bad) the vulnerabilities
are been coordinated? Why a security vulnerability has a value? Who is
buying? How security research is been done nowadays? Why the real
hackers are disappearing? This talk will give some answers and will
create even more questions. It is the opinion of someone who created
security research teams around the globe, coordinated security issues
with different companies and developed security solutions too.

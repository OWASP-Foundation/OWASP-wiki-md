**Stubs** are OWASP entries that have not yet received substantial
attention from the editors of OWASP, and as such do not yet contain
enough information to be considered real articles. In other words, they
are short or insufficient pieces of information and require additions to
further increase OWASP's usefulness. The community values stubs as
useful first steps toward complete articles. Anyone can complete them.

## Creating a stub

After writing or finding the short article, the editor should insert
**{{Stub}}** which flags the article as a stub. By convention, the [stub
template](Template:Stub "wikilink") should be placed near the bottom of
the article.

## Removing stub status

Once a stub has been properly expanded and becomes an article rather
than just a stub, you or any editor may remove the stub tag from it. No
admin action or formal permission is needed.

## Ideal stub article

When you write a stub article, it is important to bear in mind that its
main interest is to be expanded, and that thus it ideally contains
enough information to give a basis for other editors to expand upon.

1.  Your initial research may be done either through books or through a
    reliable search engine such as Google or Wikipedia. You may also
    contribute with knowledge you have acquired from other sources, but
    it is useful to conduct a small amount of research beforehand, in
    order to make sure that your version of the facts is correct and
    from a [neutral point of
    view](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view)
2.  Begin by giving a definition or description of the topic in
    question. Avoid [fallacies of
    definition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_definition).
    Since at times definitions are impossible, you should write a clear
    and informative description of the subject. State, for example, what
    a person is famous for, where a place is located and what it is
    known for, or state the basic details of an event and when it
    happened.
3.  Next, you should try to expand this basic definition. The previously
    mentioned research methods will often fetch you enough information
    for you to be able to expose the basic points of the subject. Once
    you have a couple of well-structured and well-written sentences, you
    should internally link relevant words, so that users unfamiliar with
    the specifics of a subject can understand what is written on the
    article. Avoid linking words needlessly; in case you are in doubt,
    you should use the preview button and try reading the article from
    the point of view of somebody who has had no exposure to information
    regarding the subject. If no word seems hard to comprehend or
    relevant enough, simply do not link anything.

Once you have submitted the article, there are a number of courses it
may take. An editor might get interested in it and develop it further,
or you could expand it yourself once you have found greater information
about the subject or once you have more free time on your hands.

## Sponsors

We would like to thank [Travelers
Insurance](http://www.travelers.com/)for their generous sponsorship and
helping make application security visible...

If you would like to sponsor either the food and/or door prizes for an
upcoming meeting, please email [Alvin Fong](mailto:alvin.fong@owasp.org)
with your proposal. Independent of any financial considerations,
sponsorship priority is driven by those who drive participation in OWASP
to their employees and customers.

## Call for Sponsors/Speakers

This is a call for speakers/papers. If we haven't approached you, but
you believe you have a significant discovery or new research that the
security community would value, or enjoy hearing about, we invite you to
submit your presentation topic for serious consideration. Preference
will be given to speakers who can present new and innovative technical
content to a broad audience. Of course, all presentations are expected
to challenge the brightest and quickest of attendees - we wouldn't have
it any other way.

OWASP is not a vendor fair. Consequently, there will be very little
tolerance for commercial content within presentations. Attendees will be
encouraged to quell any shameless marketing that is not immediately
backed up with rationale for its inclusion.

Some topics of interest for upcoming meetings include (but are not
limited to):

  - Risk Rating Methodologies
  - Internet of Things (IOT) Security

## Upcoming Events

DevOps vs. the "Security People"

Date/Time: Friday, 6/21 1-3pm

Location: [Travelers CRM-1, 45 Central Row, Hartford,
CT 06103](https://goo.gl/maps/bb9Xz397CmeLcfBf7)

Agenda:

1pm: "DevOps vs “Security People"

In 2019, surveys are saying that 90% of Fortune 500 plan on using
containers and things like Kubernetes, yet there’s still a divide
between what “security people” see that containers provide and what
DevOps teams see. Kubernetes has become the defacto standard for
production container deployments and there are 98 different options (as
of February 2019) for hosted Kubernetes clouds. In many cases a
Kubernetes threat model becomes compromised either by accident or by
alibi and even if you wanted to harden your environment, there’s little
guidance. Is there truly such a thing as a Kubernetes best practice? How
can Kubernetes handle multiple tenants in a cluster? Do hosted
Kubernetes services provide enough security for your work load? This
talk will explore Kubernetes’ known attack vectors, defenses, and see
how we can bridge the silos between security engineers and developers to
help in the future.

2pm: panel / chapter meeting TBD

3pm: networking

Speaker: Mark Manning is a Principal Security Consultant with NCC Group
and a lead in their Container Practice. He focuses on container
technologies, Linux kernel security, and application security, in
general. He has performed penetration tests to breakout from containers,
delivered architecture reviews of devops environments, and worked with
developers on various container and orchestration technologies such as
Docker, Kubernetes, Mesos/Marathon, as well as Rancher. Mark currently
organizes Rochester 2600 has also organized BSidesROC from 2010 through
2018.

About BSides:

Security BSides is a community-driven framework used to build events for
and by information security community members, events where individuals
have opportunities to both present and participate in an intimate
atmosphere that encourages collaboration. It is an intense experience
designed to expand the spectrum of conversation beyond the traditional
confines of space and time with discussions, demos, and participant
interaction. It’s where conversations on the next big thing are
happening

About Fairfield University:

Fairfield University sits on the Connecticut coast and is conveniently
located ½ mile from the train station offering a central location for
all attendees, whether taking public transit, train, or driving. The
Amtrak and MTA access means we’re close enough to New York City to turn
a day trip into an adventure, yet far enough to make Fairfield seem like
a completely different world. BSides Connecticut provides a much-needed
link between information security professionals and the Connecticut
technology community by offering a forum for collaborative
presentations, information exchange, and ideas.

Wireless Security Workshop

**Presentation:** [**<File:OWASP> Wireless Security
101.pdf**](:File:OWASP_Wireless_Security_101.pdf "wikilink")

This session will take a departure from some of our recent OWASP
sessions. The hosts at MakeHartford have generously offered their
classroom space for this security lab session/workshop coming out of the
OWASP pen-testing initiative group. Jon Williams will be presenting and
demonstrating some fundamental wireless security concepts. Depending on
time and if we get access to some COTS routers, we may also try to do
some hands-on wireless security testing. Plan on bringing your laptop
and spare wireless router if you can. This session is oriented toward
folks looking to learn about wireless security and getting introduced to
wireless security concepts for the first time.

Note: Due to the classroom size, we're limiting this to the first 20
participants.

Agenda:

  - Overview: Wireless security concepts
  - Remote access, Local network - encrypted and unencrypted
  - Wireless attacks:
  - Rogue access point, MiTM, Session Hijacking, Radio monitoring,
    Session theft
  - Review: Risks to remote workers
  - Game time: defensive techniques
  - Demonstration: Wireless Man-in-the-Middle and Rogue AP

About Jon Williams:

Jon Williams hails from Cheshire, CT, where he lives with his wife and
daughter and works from home as Security Administrator for IGG Software.
A taste for adventure has carried him far, from the islands of the
Bahamas where he worked towards building an eco-hostel, to the deserts
of Egypt where he taught children at environmental leadership camps, to
the high seas where he circumscribed the globe in a steamship. His
passion for technology led him into the security field, where he now
spends an unhealthy proportion of his time trying to break computer
systems so that others might improve them. He recently attained a CISSP
certification and actively contributes to projects at OWASP Hartford

**Agenda: Wednesday, Apr 26th 2017**
6:30PM - 9PM
OWASP @ MakeHartford
**Presentation:** [**<File:OWASP> Hartford pen-test lab intiative
20170322.pdf**](:File:OWASP_Hartford_pen-test_lab_intiative_20170322.pdf "wikilink")

We've got a new team working on putting together a security / pen
testing lab and security learning environment here in CT.  The goal is
to have a place where we can create and share security and pen testing
tips and tricks with our members, as well as using the lab as a means to
bolster our outreach efforts to the colleges in the area.

We're going to use this initial session to explore the MakeHartford
space and start building up that lab. If you're interested, we would
love to see you at this session. Otherwise, shoot me an email and i'll
keep you posted on working group meetings moving forward.

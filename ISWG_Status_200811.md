The goals for November included publishing the working documents
initially produced during the OWASP EU Summit working group sessions.
Unfortunately, I was too busy this quarter to find the time to make
those materials ready for public consumption. This is a priority goal
for the December/January time period.

Another goal of the month of November was to clear up the group charter.
After some thought, I think the charter of the group should be to:

1\. Contribute our security knowledge towards standards organizations
2\. Act as a consumer awareness group for web application frameworks
security mechanisms and browser security features
3\. Serve as a platform for OWASP members who want to affect change at
any of the building blocks in today's or tomorrow's web applications
It's simple and limited, and I think that's all that we can really
expect. Realistically, the browsers all have strong security teams
dealing with today's problems, and I think there's a niche for OWASP to
fill in looking at the future for them and the community.

Also, in November a discussion on the board between members led to the
creation of a Google group aiming to create an HTTPOnly standard for
browser makers to follow. We are now as a group making a first cut at a
standard after some deliberation, and have been in discussion with some
browser vendors for feedback. This is an extremely positive and global
effect.

Finally, in November I participated in the ESAPI as a representative of
the ISWG.

The goals of December/January include:

  - Formalizing the documents from the EU Summit and publish them
  - Follow up with HTTPOnly work

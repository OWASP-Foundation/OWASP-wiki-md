This major update adds several new issues, including two issues selected
by the community -
<b><u>[text=documentRootTop10New]({{Top_10:LanguageFile "wikilink")</u></b>
and
<b><u>[text=documentRootTop10New]({{Top_10:LanguageFile "wikilink")</u></b>.
Two key differentiators from previous OWASP Top 10 releases are the
substantial community feedback and extensive data assembled from dozens
of organizations, possibly the largest amount of data ever assembled in
the preparation of an application security standard. This provides us
with confidence that the new OWASP Top 10 addresses the most impactful
application security risks currently facing organizations.

The OWASP Top 10-2017 is based primarily on 40+ data submissions from
firms that specialize in application security and an industry survey
that was completed by over 500 individuals. This data spans
vulnerabilities gathered from hundreds of organizations and over 100,000
real-world applications and APIs. The Top 10 items are selected and
prioritized according to this prevalence data, in combination with
consensus estimates of exploitability, detectability, and impact.

A primary aim of the OWASP Top 10 is to educate developers, designers,
architects, managers, and organizations about the consequences of the
most common and most important web application security weaknesses. The
Top 10 provides basic techniques to protect against these high risk
problem areas, and provides guidance on where to go from here.

<b>Don't stop at 10</b>. There are hundreds of issues that could affect
the overall security of a web application as discussed in the <u>[OWASP
Developer's Guide](OWASP_Guide_Project "wikilink")</u> and the <u>[OWASP
Cheat Sheet Series](:Category:Cheatsheets "wikilink")</u>. These are
essential reading for anyone developing web applications and APIs.
Guidance on how to effectively find vulnerabilities in web applications
and APIs is provided in the <u>[OWASP Testing
Guide](OWASP_Testing_Project "wikilink")</u>.

<b>Constant change</b>. The OWASP Top 10 will continue to change. Even
without changing a single line of your application's code, you may
become vulnerable as new flaws are discovered and attack methods are
refined. Please review the advice at the end of the Top 10 in What's
Next For
<b><u>[text=documentRootTop10New]({{Top_10:LanguageFile "wikilink")</u></b>,
<b><u>[text=documentRootTop10New]({{Top_10:LanguageFile "wikilink")</u></b>,
<b><u>[text=documentRootTop10New]({{Top_10:LanguageFile "wikilink")</u></b>
and
<b><u>[text=documentRootTop10New]({{Top_10:LanguageFile "wikilink")</u></b>
for more information.

<b>Think positive</b>. When you're ready to stop chasing vulnerabilities
and focus on establishing strong application security controls, the
<u>[OWASP Proactive Controls](OWASP_Proactive_Controls "wikilink")</u>
project provides a starting point to help developers build security into
their applications and the <u>[OWASP Application Security Verification
Standard (ASVS)](ASVS "wikilink")</u> is a guide for organizations and
application reviewers on what to verify.

<b>Use tools wisely</b>. Security vulnerabilities can be quite complex
and deeply buried in code. In many cases, the most cost-effective
approach for finding and eliminating these weaknesses is human experts
armed with advanced tools. Relying on tools alone provides a false sense
of security and is not recommended.

<b>Push left, right, and everywhere</b>. Focus on making security an
integral part of your culture throughout your development organization.

We'd like to thank the organizations that contributed their
vulnerability data to support the 2017 update. We received more than 40
responses to the call for data. For the first time, all the data
contributed to a Top 10 release, and the full list of contributors, is
publicly available. We believe this is one of the larger, more diverse
collections of vulnerability data ever collected publicly.

As there are more contributors than space here, we have created a
<b><u>[text=documentRootTop10New]({{Top_10:LanguageFile "wikilink")</u></b>
to recognize the contributions made. We wish to give heartfelt thanks to
these organizations for being willing to be on the front lines by
publicly sharing vulnerability data from their efforts. We hope this
will continue to grow and encourage more organizations to do the same
and possibly be seen as one of the key milestones of evidence based
security. The OWASP Top 10 would not be possible without these amazing
contributions. 

A big thank you to the more than 500 individuals who took the time to
complete the industry ranked survey. Your voice helped determine two new
additions to the Top 10. The additional comments, notes of
encouragement, and criticisms were all appreciated. We know your time is
valuable and we wanted to say thanks.

We would like to thank those individuals who contributed significant
constructive comments and time reviewing this update to the Top 10. As
much as possible, we have listed them on the
'<b><u>[text=documentRootTop10New]({{Top_10:LanguageFile "wikilink")</u></b>'
page.

And finally, we'd like to thank in advance all the translators out there
who will translate this release of the Top 10 into numerous different
languages, helping to make the OWASP Top 10 more accessible to the
entire planet.

This page contains details about funds available to OWASP projects.

The sponsorship model is different from the one used in [OWASP Autumn Of
Code 2006](OWASP_Autumn_Of_Code_2006 "wikilink"), [OWASP Spring Of Code
2007](OWASP_Spring_Of_Code_2007 "wikilink"), [OWASP Summer of Code
2008](OWASP_Summer_of_Code_2008 "wikilink") and [OWASP Season of Code
2009](OWASP_Season_of_Code_2009 "wikilink") since these are cases where
specific money (throughout out the year) has been allocated to OWASP
projects (for example by new OWASP members or by companies/organizations
with specific requirements/projects)

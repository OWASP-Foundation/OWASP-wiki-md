The OWASP Top Ten Proactive Controls 2018
(By: **Jim Manico**)
Software developers are the foundation of any application. In order to
achieve secure software, developers must be supported and helped by the
organization they author code for. As software developers author code
that makes up a web application, they need to embrace and practice a
wide variety of secure coding techniques. The OWASP Top Ten Proactive
Controls (2018) is an OWASP documentation project that lists critical
security techniques that should be included in every software
development project. This document was written by developers for
developers to assist those new to secure development.

Bypassing iOS Security using Enterprise Provisioning Hooks and
Enterprise Mobility Management
(By: **Georgia Weidman**)
This talk demonstrates how features Apple includes in their iOS
ecosystem to support corporate enterprise provisioning and management
can be used to exploit all iOS devices. We will cover the faculties that
Apple includes to allow enterprises and mobile security vendors to
remotely provision settings and load applications and how a malicious
attacker could take advantage of these vectors. We will discuss
Configuration Profile options with security implications and using the
Enterprise Development Program to bypass Apple’s anti-malware app
controls. Though Apple considers this a “feature not a bug” and a
phishing issue, no anti-phishing training readily available for either
consumers or corporations specifically address these phishing attacks.
However, according to the Verizon Breach Report over 90% of enterprise
compromises came in through endpoints, largely from phishing. Mobile
devices open up a wide range of additional phishing options than the
email scenarios. We will demonstrate how penetration testers and red
teams can simulate these attacks to raise user awareness and perform
impact analysis of a potential breach begun by a compromised iOS
device.

Egypt Cyber and Privacy Security Requirements for Software Developers.
(By: **Mohamed Alfateh**)

In this session, we will discuss number of Cyber law clauses that should
be considered in developing software applications, we will go through
the final draft of the executive regulation to highlight the additional
controls that should be implemented in the applications, that will add
extra layer of security and ensure the compliance with the Cyber law
requirements.

'''Event Agenda: '''
Diffusing A Bomb With Reverse Engineering
(By: **Fady Othman**)
A while ago I stumbled upon an online reverse engineering challenge, I
downloaded the challenge and from the beginning it caught my attention.
I started reversing and I realized that it was a well designed challenge
that is perfect to teach reverse engineering. after solving the
challenge I was disappointed when I looked online to see how other
people solved it because it was solved in a way that teaches them too
little. In this workshop I will “diffuse” the “bomb” using multiple
methods and multiple tools (hopefully IDA, GDB, EDB, Radare2) to make
the most of it and trying to teach something new on the way.

Defending Applications by putting them under the Proactive SOC
spotlight
(By: **Mohamed Alfateh**)
Most companies are trying to shift their Security Operations Center
(SOC) from a reactive to a proactive posture. Putting the application
layer under a proactive monitoring and analysis is a critical activity
to anticipates and pre-empts incidents to prevent their occurrence. In
this talk we will discuss different techniques to proactively anticipate
web threats and act upon anticipation proactively rather than passively.
During the session, we will show how you could use OWASP AppSensor to
feed data into SOC and to respond to analysis results. The session will
introduce number of corresponding SIEM use cases that could be
implemented in deferent SIEM technologies.

PANEL DISCUSSION: WHAT’S NEW WITH OWASP TOP 10
(By: **Ahmed Saafan, Hassan Morad, Mohamed Alfateh and Fady Othman**)
OWASP released a major update to the OWASP top 10 project. In this
session we will look at what is new in the 2017 version. We will discuss
the major changes to the top 10 list and whether or not such changes
brings better value to application security.

'''Day 3: Cross Site Scripting '''
XSS flaws occur whenever an application includes untrusted data in a new
web page without proper validation or escaping, or updates an existing
web page with user supplied data using a browser API that can create
JavaScript. XSS allows attackers to execute scripts in the victim’s
browser which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites, or redirect
the user to malicious sites.

'''Day 5: Security Misconfiguration '''
Good security requires having a secure configuration defined and
deployed for the application, frameworks, application server, web
server, database server, platform, etc. Secure settings should be
defined, implemented, and maintained, as defaults are often insecure.
Additionally, software should be kept up to date.

'''Day 6: Sensitive Data Exposure '''
Many web applications and APIs do not properly protect sensitive data,
such as financial, healthcare, and PII. Attackers may steal or modify
such weakly protected data to conduct credit card fraud, identity theft,
or other crimes. Sensitive data deserves extra protection such as
encryption at rest or in transit, as well as special precautions when
exchanged with the browser.

'''Event Agenda: '''
The Hidden Venom : Dangerous Formats
(By: **Fady Othman**)
In the past years, we have seen the development of client-side attacks
and how hackers became smarter and smarter. We came to a realization
that you don't really need a zero day or advanced exploit to spread a
malware or ransomware. all what you need is a good social engineering
trick and the knowledge of how to abuse a legitimate file format. In
this talk, we will have a look at seemingly non-harmful file formats and
how they can be abused to spread malware.

Exploiting PHP Serialized Objects for Authentication bypass
(By: **Ebrahim Hegazy**)
In this session, I will talk about PHP Serialized Objects as following:
1- What is PHP Serialized/Unserialize Objects and how it works, 2- Demo
Code on PHP Serialized Objects, 3- Exploitation scenarios for Serialized
Objects, 4- Practical example of exploiting Serialized Objects for
Authentication bypass & Privilege Escalation.

The Hidden Venom : Detecting APTs at web application layer
(By: **Mohamed Alfateh**)
Detecting and defending against Multi - Stage Advanced Persistent
Threats (APT) Attacks is a challenge for mechanisms that are static in
its nature and are based on blacklisting and malware signature
techniques. The comprehensive analysis and correlation can discover
behavior indicative of APT-related attacks and data exfiltration. In the
web application layer, other techniques are used to detect the
sophisticated web attacks. In this presentation, we will discuss some
techniques that could be used to deal with the APTs in the web
application layer.

\------------------------------------------------------------
'''Day 1: Injection Day '''
Injection is an entire class of attacks that rely on injecting data into
a web application in order to facilitate the execution or interpretation
of malicious data in an unexpected manner. Examples of attacks within
this class include Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, Header
Injection, Log Injection and Full Path Disclosure. I’m scratching the
surface here.

This class of attacks is every programmer’s bogeyman. They are the most
common and successful attacks on the internet due to their numerous
types, large attack surface, and the complexity sometimes needed to
protect against them. The injection day includes three sessions covering
the Injection Attacks and Mitigations,

Hunting for the bad guys
(By: **Hassan Mourad**)
Recently, a new breed of security solutions appeared in the market,
Sandbox based Antimalware solutions, promissing to be the answer to
advanced malware and APTs.

Yet, as always, there are ways to circumvent any control. In this
presentation we will examin a new technique to bypass sandbox based
solutions, allowing malware to avoid detection and giving it a free pass
to your network.

'''Event Agenda: '''
Software Security Assurance
(By: **Nadim Barsoum**)
Implementing a software security assurance program can be a daunting
task that can leave program managers and consultants equally
overwhelmed. In this talk we discuss the main building blocks of a
software security assurance program and suggest light-weight methods for
jump-starting your program with a focus on assurance activities and
their relating governance aspects.

Mobile Application Security
(By: **Hassan Elhadary**)
Nowadays web applications are being transformed into mobile applications
allowing users to perform security critical functions such as money
transfers and bill payments from their mobile devices. Newly added
features on mobile applications expose new attack surface for hackers
and thus increase the challenges for developers to defend their mobile
applications. This talk will focus on latest techniques utilized by
attackers to conduct security attacks on mobile applications. It will
include real life stories and demos inspired from professional
experience and research in bug bounty programs. Finally, recommendations
will be outlined to help developers mitigate most common attacks
affecting mobile applications.

Application Threat Modeling
(By: **Mohamed Alfateh**)
According to the US Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT), most
successful cyber-attacks result from targeting and exploiting software
vulnerabilities. Threat Modeling is a critical activity for identifying
such vulnerabilities early in the development stages. In this talk, we
will discuss application threat modeling process, how to perform threat
modeling in systematic way and how to integrate threat modeling in your
software development life-cycle.

Sessions Description

-----

**Pwning the skiddies using the anonymity weapon**
Proxy services and vpn servers are used widely all over the world But ,
can you really depend on them as secure way to surf the WWW? We gonna
demonstrate how the such services are invisibly used to take over
thousands of PCs every single hour.
**Sleeping your way out of the sandbox**
Recently, a new breed of security solutions appeared in the market,
Sandbox based Antimalware solutions, promising to be the answer to
advanced malware and APTs.

Yet, as always, there are ways to circumvent any control. In this
presentation we will examine a new technique to bypass sandbox based
solutions, allowing malware to avoid detection and giving it a free pass
to your network.
**HTML5 security**
HTML5 was specially designed to deliver rich content without the need
for additional plugins. The current version delivers everything from
animation to graphics, music to movies, and can also be used to build
complicated web applications. Through introducing these new features new
vulnerabilities are introduced as well.

This talk will give an introduction about HTML5 and its new features.
Then will select a number of examples to demonstrate the positive, and
negative impact of these features for web application security.

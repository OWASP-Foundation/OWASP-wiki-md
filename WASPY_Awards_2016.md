## **Purpose of the Awards**

Each year there are many individuals who do amazing work, dedicating
countless hours to share, improve, and strengthen the OWASP mission.
Some of these individuals are well known to the community while others
are not.

**The purpose of these awards is to bring recognition to those who "FLY
UNDER THE RADAR". These are the individuals who are passionate about
OWASP, who contribute hours of their own free time to the organization
to help improve the cyber-security world, yet seem to go
unrecognized.**

Community members are able to nominate 1 individual per category (see
Categories below) who they feel best fits these descriptions so that, as
a community, we can recognize these people for their contributions. We
are tying in the WASPY Awards to help identify and recognize individuals
who demonstrate our core values and annual report theme of *Leading -
Learning - Sharing - Growing*. We value your input and consideration for
nominations in the categories below.

## **Categories**

1\. **Open/Leading** - Everything at OWASP is radically transparent –
from our finances to our code. This award goes to a member of the OWASP
community who has supported the OWASP mission of transparency through
their influence, management, and leadership in the community. This might
be a chapter or project leader or may be someone who has worked within
the community.
2\. **Integrity/Learning** - OWASP is an honest and truthful, vendor
neutral, global community. This award goes to an individual who
recognizes the benefits of the power of the collective community within
OWASP, who challenges the status quo, and generates an excitement in the
learning community.

3\. **Innovation/Sharing** - OWASP encourages and supports innovation
and experiments for solutions to software security challenges. This
award goes to an individual who has inspired and encouraged others in
the arena of software security with innovative and cutting edge
solutions to software security challenges.

4\. **Global/Growing** - Around the world, OWASP encourages and supports
innovation and experiments for solutions to software security
challenges. This award goes to an individual who truly represents the
OWASP Global scope and recognizes the importance of growth. The nominee
reaches out beyond the OWASP circle to raise awareness of software
security in locations outside of the OWASP comfort zone.

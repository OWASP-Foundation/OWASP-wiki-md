# Introduction

## Introduction

We are proud to announce the fifth annual OWASP New Zealand Day
conference, to be held at the University of Auckland on Thursday
September 12th, 2013. OWASP New Zealand Day is a one-day conference
dedicated to application security, with an emphasis on secure
development techniques to help Kiwi developers build more secure
applications.

Similar to last year:

  - We will be offering training on the day before the conference
    (Wednesday, 11th of September).
  - After lunch on the conference day, we will split to two tracks - one
    focused on deep technical topics, the other on policy, compliance
    and risk management.

The fifth OWASP New Zealand Day will be happening thanks to the support
provided by the University of Auckland School of Business, which will
kindly offer the same conference venue of the last four years. Entry to
the event will, as in the past, be free.

# Speakers List

## Speakers List

### Tom Eastman - Catalyst IT - Serialization Formats Aren't Toys

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

Do you have an API? Do you accept input from users? Do you accept it in
XML? What about YAML? Or maybe JSON? How safe are you? How sure are you?
It's not in the OWASP Top 10, but you don't have to look far to hear
stories of security vulnerabilities involving deserialization user
inputs. Why do they keep happening?

In this talk I'll go over what the threat is, how you might be making
yourself vulnerable and how to mitigate the problem. I'll cover the
features (not bugs, features) of formats like XML, YAML, and JSON that
make them surprisingly dangerous, and how to protect your code from
them.

Because here's the thing: If you are using, say, a compliant, properly
implemented XML parser to parse your XML, you are NOT safe. Possibly
quite the opposite.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Tom is a senior Python developer and technical lead for Catalyst IT, New
Zealand's largest company specialising in open source. Prior to that he
worked as a developer and system administrator for the University of
Otago Faculty of Medicine and as a Computer Science tutor for same.

### Paul Haas - Security-Assessment.com - Improving XPath Injection with Binary Search Optimisations

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

XPath injection is technique similar to SQL injection for attacking XML
processors, however many people are unaware of the technique and
exploitation vectors. This talk aims to expand awareness of both the
risks and remediation path in addition to the introduction of a new
technique to significantly improve reconstruction speed of the backend
XML document. A brief primer to XPath injection will also be covered
within the talk.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Paul Haas hails from California where the waves are better but the
quakes are not. With over nine years of experience in professional
hacking, he is currently working with Security-Assessment.com in
Wellington to bring the good word of web hacks to Kiwis everywhere. His
sole hobby is driving people into Mario Kart's abyss.

### Nick von Dadelszen - Lateral Security - Security Vulnerability Disclosure

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

Disclosing security vulnerabilities can be a dangerous business. While
there are systems in place for handling disclosures to most major
software companies, the process for disclosing vulnerabilities to local
organisations is a lot less discussed.

As the discloser, there is always the chance that you are accused of
hacking and get a visit from the police merely for identifying an issue.
As an organisation, you can find yourself on the front page of the news
when someone goes public with an issue.

This talk outlines the dilemmas faced when stumbling across that SQL
injection in the local shopping site and proposes mechanisms to safely
get the right people told about it. It also discusses how organisations
can make it more likely that security vulnerabilities are reported to
them directly, rather than through the press.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Nick von Dadelszen is the technical director at Lateral Security. Nick
has been performing professional penetration testing for over 12 years
and has managed several successful penetration testing teams. He has
worked with the majority of large corporates and Government agencies in
New Zealand and is a regular presenter at OWASP and Kiwicon conferences.

### Mark Piper - Insomnia Security - OWASP Top 10 Mobile Risks - An Introduction By Case Study

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

As mobile application usage explodes, so does the associated application
security issues. The OWASP Mobile Security Project includes an
initiative to categorise and rate these issues into a top 10 format.
This list is known as the Top 10 Mobile Risks.

During the session, we will introduce the current (RC1) Top 10 supported
with several real world case studies of issues. We will cover how the
issues were identified, how they may be exploited by attackers and what
mitigation's could be implemented to resolve the issues in the future.
While the issues will be largely platform agnostic, the examples will
cover both iOS and Android environments.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Mark is a Principal Security Consultant with the Insomnia Security team.
Mark spends his days auditing software, running penetration testing and
red team engagements while working with global customers on developing
new testing services.

### Kirk Jackson and Andy Prow - Xero and Aura Security - Bad Smells That Lead to Bad Security

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

Your job as a defender is to reduce the attack surface of your web
application and protect your infrastructure and data from being
breached. However we can't be involved in every decision that goes on in
our organisation, and we don't always think the same as an attacker
does. This talk will introduce you to some common "bad smells" that
might indicate security issues lurking under the surface of your code,
and help you develop your spidey sense so that you know when to raise
the alarm.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Kirk is the Security Officer at Xero, and is interested in writing and
defending secure web applications.

Andy Prow is an IT Security Consultant, Trainer and software developer
who founded Aura back in 2001. With 19 years in the IT industry Andy has
developed code for IBM, Vodafone, Telecom and Microsoft. Andy presents
around the world at conferences including Microsoft's TechEd.

### Kim Carter - BinaryMist - What's Our Software Doing With All That User Input

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

What are we doing with all the characters that get shoved into our
applications? Have we considered every potential execution context? It's
often interesting and surprising to see what sort of concoction of
characters can be executed in different places... and linking multiple
attack vectors together which the builders haven't thought about. What
are we trusting? Why are we trusting it? What, where and how should we
be sanitising?

We have a vast collection of libraries, techniques, cheat sheets,
tutorials, guides and tools at our disposal. I often find myself
thinking... how can we commoditise the sanitisation of user input and I
keep coming up with the same answer. It's not easy. Every application
has a completely different set of concerns.

In order for our software to be shielded from an attack, the builders
must think like attackers.

In this talk I'll attempt to:

  - Increase our knowledge and awareness
  - Discuss practical techniques and approaches that increase our
    defences
  - Break some software

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Kim Carter is a Software Engineer, Architect, Entrepreneur and the
founder of BinaryMist. He is passionate about and enjoys many things.
Some of which include:

  - Designing and creating robust software and networks.
  - Breaking his and others software and networks, then fixing it/them.
  - Teaching, training, mentoring, motivating, listening to and being
    around smart people.
  - Increasing quality awareness and helping people and organisations
    implement higher quality in a cost effective manner.
  - Improving operational efficiencies.

### Hugh Davenport - Aura RedEye Security - Bug Chaining (aka, why XSS can be worse than you think)

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

Security bugs can range in damage from small stuff, all the way to big
stuff. Some people only focus on the large stuff, and the smaller stuff
can go unnoticed. This talk will give a real world example of a project
that had a small bug, that allowed a larger bug to happen, which allowed
a larger bug, which allowed for unwanted shell access.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Hugh works at Aura RedEye Security on their managed vulnerability
scanning service. In his spare time, he is the security point of contact
on the Mahara open source tool and contributes to many other open source
projects.

### Hinne Hettema - University of Auckland - Evolution of Threats and the Skills in our Security Team

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

The threat landscape for security threats is constantly evolving, with
new threats being stealthier, more diverse, and increasingly aimed at
bypassing the protection offered by antivirus and network intrusion
detection systems. Adversaries are now often part of a semi-organised
underground economy geared towards the acquisition and sale of digital
assets such as usernames, passwords, confidential business information,
financial data and designs. There are specific value chains in this
economy, which make the acquisition, sale and utilisation of such assets
a relatively easy process.

This talk focuses on the skills needed in a security team to deal with
this next level of threat, and on the sort of teams that we need in
enterprise security to address the modern threats that we face.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Hinne Hettema is the team leader of the IT security team at The
University of Auckland, an honorary research fellow in the Department of
Philosophy at The University of Auckland, and lectures in cyber security
at Unitec. He has 10 years experience in security consulting and has a
PhD in Philosophy (2012) and theoretical chemistry (1993).

### Francois Marier - Mozilla - Securing the Web Without Site-Specific Passwords

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

Has anyone else noticed that the OWASP Top 10 is not changing very much?
Especially in the realm of authentication-related problems. I don't
claim to have the one true solution for this, but one thing is certain:
if we change how things are done on the web and relieve developers from
having to store passwords, we can make things better.

We need to let web developers outsource their authentication needs to
people who can do it well. Does that mean we should force all of our
users to join Facebook? Well not really. That might work for some sites,
but outsourcing all of our logins to a single for-profit company isn't a
solution that works for the whole web.

The open web needs a better solution. One that enable users to choose
their identity provider and shop for the most secure one if that's what
they're into. This is the promise behind Persona and the BrowserID
protocol. Choose your email provider carefully and let's get rid of all
of these site-specific passwords that are just sitting there waiting to
be leaked and cracked.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Francois is a software engineer and security champion on the Mozilla
Identity team where he works on decentralising authentication on the
web. A long time Debian developer, Francois has been involved in Open
Source and web development for a while and has always had a strong
interest in security.

### Andrew Kelly - Nothing to See Here\!

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

This is how it starts: "Seeking an exciting new challenge? Want to be
responsible for building and shaping an embryonic information security
function? Then you so won't want to miss this golden opportunity\!"
Andrew will talk about the setting up of an information security
function in an organisation from scratch ('Greenfield') - as opposed to
trying to bed yourself down into an already-existing organisation
('Brownfield'). He'll talk about the pros and the cons, and the many ups
and downs. And hopefully he'll answer some questions like: Is there, if
fact, any such thing as a greenfield security opportunity left in the
wild? And ... if such mythical beasties do exist ... are they worth
signing on for? Andrew will discuss the pitfalls and pratfalls of the
journey from initial engagement, through (maybe) acceptance, until
(perhaps) security sign-off and (hopefully) go-live. He'll also discuss
both the Pit Bulls and prats you're likely to meet along the way. So ...
if you want to hear a guy speak who reckons he's forgotten more than he
ever thought he knew? Then this is so the talk for you\!

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Andrew is a whole year older than he was when he presented at last
year's OWASP Day: So this time around he's bringing a quarter century's
worth of IT security experience to OWASP\! Now 25 years ago, he was this
mainframe security uber-tech - but today Andrew's recognised as being a
'pragmatic' subject-matter expert on corporate-level information
security policy, compliance, frameworks and governance. His first
greenfield security 'opportunity' came in November 1989 at the Sun Life
Assurance Company of Canada, in the UK. And during those intervening 24
years, he's had similar experiences at various other companies including
the likes of Lloyds/TSB Bank, Fonterra, BT Syntegra, Telecom/Gen-i and,
lately, Health Benefits Ltd. - amongst many others.

# Training

## Training Events

We are happy to announce that training will run on Wednesday September
11th 2013, the day before the OWASP Day conference. Both courses will be
running from **9:00 AM sharp** to **5:00PM**.The training venues will be
auditoriums kindly provided by the University of Auckland, in the same
building as the OWASP Day conference itself. Classes will contain up to
20 students, and each seat has power for laptop usage. Both courses will
be run by Aura Information Security, and there is both a basic and
advanced course available. Feedback from previous training has been very
positive - so get in quick\! Details are as follows:

### Basic Web Application Security

These days websites are under constant attack and it's incredibly easy
for a developer or administrator to make seemingly minor mistakes that
introduce security vulnerabilities.

You can't fight a war that you don't know you're waging. You can't
defend your websites against attack unless you know the tricks the
attackers are using to infiltrate. By the end of this workshop you'll
have a good understanding of the OWASP Top 10 including:

  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  - SQL Injection
  - Man-In-the-Middle attacks
  - Layering your defenses (defense-in-depth) that can help protect you
    from exploit chaining.

More importantly, however, you'll also learn how to minimise the risk
from these and other attacks, with practical tips that you can apply
straight away to help you design, build and manage more secure websites.
This workshop is essential for:

  - All developers and designers working on web applications but without
    formal training in security
  - Anyone working in the website / web application space
  - IT Professionals interested in security issues

This is a hands on workshop where attendees must bring their own
laptops. It is required that users are local admins or root on their own
machines.

### Advanced Web Application Security

This advanced web security course is for senior or experienced
developers who are looking for a deeper understanding of web security,
beyond the OWASP Top 10. By the end of this workshop you'll have a good
understanding of:

#### Advanced Attacks

We will run through more complex attacks against web-apps using layered
attacks requiring a multi-step defense including

  - Malicious file uploads and web shells
  - XXS shells
  - Padding oracle attacks
  - XXE injection attacks
  - Serialisation and file include attacks
  - Timing attacks
  - Cryptography

# Call For Sponsorships

## Call For Sponsorships

OWASP New Zealand Day 2013 will be held in Auckland on the 12th of
September, 2013 and is a security conference entirely dedicated to
application security. The conference is once again being hosted by the
University of Auckland with their support and assistance. OWASP New
Zealand Day 2013 is a free event, but requires sponsor support to help
be an instructive and quality event for the New Zealand community. OWASP
is strictly non for profit. The sponsorship money will be used to help
make OWASP New Zealand Day 2013 a free, compelling, and valuable
experience for the audience.

The sponsorship funds collected are to be used for things such as:

  - Refreshments (coffee break/lunch) - we want to keep people refreshed
    during the day; while we certainly bring good and interesting
    speakers, we don't want people to go home when they become hungry.
  - Name tags - we feel that getting to know people within the New
    Zealand community is important, and name tags make that possible.
  - Promotion - up to now our events are propagating by word of mouth.
    We would like to get to a wider audience by advertising our events.
  - Printed Materials - printed materials will include brochures, tags
    and lanyards.

## Facts

Last year, the event was supported by seven sponsors and attracted more
than 250 participants. Plenty of constructive (and positive\!) feedback
from the audience was received and we are using this to make the
conference more appealing to more people. For more information on last
year's event, please visit:
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2012>

The OWASP New Zealand community is strong and there are more than 220
people currently subscribed to the mailing-list. OWASP New Zealand Day
is expected to attract between 250 and 300 attendees this year.

OWASP regular attendees are IT project managers, IT security managers,
IT security consultants, web application architects and developers, QA
managers, QA testers and system administrators.

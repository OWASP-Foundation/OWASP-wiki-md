# Introduction

The intent of this guide is to help Chief Information Security Officers
(CISOs) and SecDevOps managers in the initiation, creation and
management of new application security programs and initiatives within
their organisation as well as for improvements of existing application
security processes, standards, training and tools.

OWASP resources such as projects are referenced throughout this guide.
These resources can be used by CISOs and SecDevOps managers for creating
standards, conduct application security assessments, develop training
modules for software developers. OWASP free tools for security testing
of web application vulnerabilities are also referenced in this guide.

## Scope

The scope of this guide is application security and the security of the
components of the application architecture such as clients, servers,
databases, services, software components and libraries. This scope of
this guide does not cover other aspects that are essential to the
security of the application such as network and infrastructure security.

## Objectives

This guide is written in alignment of OWASP mission main goal that is
"making application security visible and empowering application security
stakeholders with the right information for managing application
security risks". Specifically we seek to provide guidance on the
following aspects of the application security program:

  - Assuring compliance of applications with security regulations for
    privacy, data protection and information security
  - Leveraging OWASP resources such as project documentation and tools
  - Managing application security from perspective or people/training,
    processes and tools/technologies
  - Managing application vulnerability risks and remediation based upon
    risk exposure to the business
  - Creating awareness on cyber-threats targeting applications to focus
    on countermeasures
  - Operationalisation of application security assessments
  - Supporting development teams for continuous software security
    development and testing
  - Integration of existing applications with emerging technologies such
    as API, micro-services, cloud, virtualisation, biometrics
  - Creation of an application security strategy in alignment with
    business and IT strategy
  - Focusing on process automation and process improvements
  - Helping CISOs and SecDevOps managers to be an agent of change in
    challenging corporate environments and trigger appropriate responses
  - Help CISOs and SecDevOps to ask the right questions to gain
    visibility across the organisation (who does what questions)
  - Capturing the lesson learned from past security incidents/data
    breaches
  - Setting roadmaps for process improvements

## Target Audience

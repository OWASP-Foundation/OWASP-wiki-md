## The Presentation: "Adobe Flex, AMF 3 and BlazeDS: An Assessment"

Adobe FLEX with BlazeDS offers developers a streamlined application
development paradigm, allowing them to create rich Internet applications
with little exertion. However, ease of implementation often results in
incomplete engineering. In this presentation, Stadmeyer offers his
assessment of the FLEX and BlazeDS application architectures as well as
detailed examination of the Action Message Format version 3. Developers
and administrators will be provided clear examples of how to do things
wrong, how to do them right and explain exactly how each component works
internally.

While little information is available in the field regarding a FLEX
application, Trustwave's security experts will share the knowledge
they've gained in migrating towards a Flex application environment.
Additionally, the briefing will provide information to both security
assessors and developers about a technology that is soon to be
prevalent, but is not yet widely understood.

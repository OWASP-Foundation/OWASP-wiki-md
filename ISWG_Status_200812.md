The goals of December/January included:

  - Formalizing the documents from the EU Summit and publish them
  - Following up with HTTPOnly work

The group, led by Bil Corry and including Jim Manico, Arshan Dabirsiaghi
and others have been involved with spinning off all of the HTTPOnly RFC
draft work into an official IETF group. This work will continue and has
attracted other notables researchers and may result in an in-person
meeting later in the year.

The documents from the EU Summit have been formalized. I have sent a
last call for comments to the OWASP leader lists for the Web Application
Framework security consumer report. Also, I have posted the [Open Letter
to the Browsers](ISWG_Open_Letters_to_ISWG "wikilink") and am seeking
last minute revisions before publishing in early February.

In the month of February I plan on spending time publicizing the OWASP
Open Letter to the Browsers, maintaining the Web Application Framework
Security Matrix, and continuing to reach out to the Struts and Spring
frameworks.

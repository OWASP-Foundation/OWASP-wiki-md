## Goals

The OWASP PHP Project's overall goal is to...

`Produce materials that show PHP developers, application architects, and `
`systems administrators how to deal with most common application security`
`problems throughout the complete lifecycle of the application.`

In the near term, we are focused on the following tactical goals:

1.  Implementing Security using Best Practices (Non Framework Based
    Applications)
2.  Provide examples of how to prevent Cross Site Scripting attacks in
    popular web frameworks
3.  Provide examples of how to prevent SQL Injection in popular data
    access frameworks
4.  Provide examples of how to prevent Cross Site Scripting attacks in
    popular AJAX frameworks
5.  Provide examples of how to prevent LDAP injection in PHP
6.  Secure configuration guides

## Current Tasks

  - Call for volunteers - Join the [mailing
    list](http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-phpness), read

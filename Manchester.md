# Code of conduct

OWASP Manchester meetings and events are an inclusive environment where
all people should feel safe and respected. We welcome diversity in age,
race, ethnicity, national origin, range of abilities, sexual
orientation, gender identity, financial means, education, and political
perspective.

OWASP Manchester will not tolerate any form of violence, harassment,
hate speech or trolling either off or online, or any overly drunken,
intimidating or heckling behaviour.

Please respect the presenters, don’t talk amongst yourselves during
their presentations and ensure your mobile phones are muted or switched
off.

We want you to have fun, in a safe and respectful environment.

If you have any issues or concerns relating to the code of conduct
please contact one or the Chapter Leads either in person, though the
Meetup page or via email.

Chapter Leads:

  - Ben Fountain
  - Daniel Pollard
  - Joe Carter
  - Nikola Milosevic
  - Saskia Coplans
  - Wes Parsons

(email addresses are on the OWASP website
[1](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Manchester)).

As this is a private event we withhold the right to remove and
ultimately ban anyone who violates this code of conduct and will report
any incidents to the appropriate authorities if necessary.

**Polite note to Vendors/Recruiters/Internal Recruiters/Business
Development people**

Vendors and Recruiters are welcome at OWASP Manchester, however we ask
that you remember this is a user group, not a networking event, and
tapping people up for jobs or business unprompted is not encouraged.

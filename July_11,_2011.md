Global Committee Consolidation - Observations and Recommendations
submitted 10-Jun via email.

Proposal made to consolidate Global Committees to 3: Conferences,
Chapters, and Projects

Education, Industry, Connections, and Membership committees would be
restructured into task forces which emerge from ecosystems as focused
working groups with a budget and a charter to meet a predefined goal.

## New business

Seba:

  - New contract Sarah, (re)negotiation Paulo, status Larry

<!-- end list -->

  - Voting Rights for Chapter/Project Leader:

Dave - Yes; Eoin - open vote to all; Jeff - yes, and make them honorary
members; Tom - Yes; Matt - yes; Seba - yes

So, board vote to allow chapter/project leaders to vote is affirmative.

Continued vote - do we reinstate the "honorary memberships" as well

Kate

  - Konik (vendor) will warehouse and ship (provide fulfillment
    services) approved merchandise at no additional cost (other than
    shipping) to addresses for approved events. This will eliminate the
    need for storage and will provided better accounting and tracking.

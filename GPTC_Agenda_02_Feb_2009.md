  - Finish up the discussion of the [GPTC Agenda 20 Jan
    2009](GPTC_Agenda_20_Jan_2009 "wikilink").
  - From the referred previous agenda, two main questions should have
    the Committee's attention:

<!-- end list -->

1.  Can a set of criterion be established to define OWASP priorities in
    terms of projects available to be sponsored by our OWASP Members?
2.  We need to set up as as possible a new season of code. How will it
    be done? [FYI - Current SoC's
    status](http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dcn8962c_34fdbm4zqn).

Proposed deliverables for meeting:

  - Agreement on how to close SoC 08
      - are we going to create two types of 'Release', 'Beta' and
        'Alpha' projects?
  - Agreement on strategy for next season of code
      - role of Reviewers
      - Objectives (for example alignment with
        <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Global_Projects_and_Tools_Committee>)
      - Initial Budget

<!-- end list -->

  - Complete 'report for OWASP board' list (see below)
  - new projects approval process

      -
      - caveat is that by the end of the SoC 09 any project that has not
        been rated becomes a Alpha

          - Launch SoC: 4th March
          - Deadline for applications: 26th March
          - Deadline for Board Decision: 8th April
          - Start of SoC 09: 9th April
          - Completion for SoC 09 is next OWASP USA conference

      -
  - Budget for next Season of Code 09
      - 125,000k (100k for participants and 25k for reviewers)
      - Ticket for Summit is worth 2,000 USD, and each applicant can
        'buy' it with their SoC (remember that Summit is going to be
        invitation only)

<!-- end list -->

  -   - New Projects Page stucture
          - Meet the assessment Criteria

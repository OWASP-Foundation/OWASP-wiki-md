  - Proposals Review Team: Dennis Groves, Daniel Cuthbert, Dinis Cruz

## Initiative: Funds Available for OWASP Projects

**What:** OWASP Project Sponsorship model where OWASP Leaders can spend
up-to the current allocated budget on OWASP Projects

**Rules-of-Engagement:**

  - Funds are to be used on OWASP Projects
  - Funds to be personally allocated by an OWASP Leader (who takes
    responsibility for its use and execution)
  - OWASP leaders are free to spend the funds on OWASP Projects in
    anyway they feel relevant, with only the following KEY restrictions:
      - They can't pay another OWASP leaders or a company that an OWASP
        leader is directly connected to
      - For amounts less than $500 they add its description to the
        respective OWASP WIKI page 24h before they commit to make the
        expense
      - For amounts less than $5000 they add its description to the
        respective OWASP WIKI 7 days before they commit to make the
        expense
      - If there are no comments or objections by the 'Proposals Review
        Team', the funds are automatically approved
      - If a member of the 'Proposals Review Team' objects or asks for
        more information, the funds are NOT approved (until further
        clarifications)
  - Each expense item is mapped to an individual OWASP leader and
    multiple OWASP Leaders can work together.
  - Payments will be made by Alison on Invoice submission (by paypal or
    direct bank transfer)

In 6 months time, a review of the outcomes will be done and see these
rules need to be changed

    GRID.

#### **OWASP Media Project**

Up until now, with GSD we managed to get 5 captures cards in order to
record and stream presentation content. This translate to over 70 hours
of content. Saving in money are also made by conference organisation as
they don't have to rent costly equipment.

### FAQ

For Participants:

  - **What is an OWASP Leader?** : Everybody in the owasp-leaders list
  - **Can these funds be used on other OWASP innitiatives (Chapters,
    Conferences, Summits, etc..)** : Nope this is only for OWASP
    Projects
  - *' What happens if the 'Proposals Review Team' objects or asks
    questions*' : The OWASP Leader behind the proposal needs to come
    back with a better idea or answer :)
  - **Is there some kind of
    '[Gamification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification) theory'
    behind this idea?** : Yes :)

For Members of the 'Proposals Review Team':

  - **What should I do if I like a proposal?** : Nothing (unless you
    have time to help that proposal). Note that proposals with no
    'doubts' are approved by default
  - **What should I do if I have doubts about a proposal?** : Write a
    comment and raise your doubts/questions. Note that proposals with
    (at least one ) 'doubt' comment and NOT approved by default

### GSD Ideas

Here are a couple ideas on where to use available GSD funds:

  - buy 20 copies of the (for example) Open SAMM book and distribute it
    at a local OWASP chapter meeting
  - support the OWASP Developer Guide and ASVS projects (for example
    with copywriting, formatting, design, research, proof-reading,
    pagination, etc...)
  - improve the formatting and presentation of the 'Cheat-Sheet' series,
  - hire a transcription service for key presentations done at OWASP
    chapters/events (or OWASP PodCasts)
  - create a DVD with all presentations from a specific OWASP event (or
    other video materials like the AppSec tutorial series)
  - sponsor a booth at an event to present OWASP Projects
  - sponsor travel expenses for a project leader to meet with other
    project leaders or collaborators (to work on a particular project)
  - organize a mini-summit around an OWASP project
  - create a mini-website focused on a particular project (like
    ESAPI.org)
  - try out a specific commercial service that will make a particular
    project more effective (version control, bug tracking system,
    mailing lists, etc...)
  - hire designers to work on OWASP projects
  - translate OWASP content (to and from English)
  - sponsor students to work on OWASP projects (maybe even run a
    mini-OWASP Season of Code)
  - hire mediawiki editors for the OWASP website (the OWASP projects
    part of it :) )
  - etc...

Forum](https://buildsecurityin.us-cert.gov/bsi/events/1133-BSI.html)

#### Welcome

Welcome to the **OWASP Software Assurance Day DC 2010** wiki page.

This single-day training session will be held on **September 27th** as a
part of the **13th Semi-Annual Software Assurance Forum** (September
27th - October 1st) sponsored by the US Department of Homeland Security
(DHS), Department of Defense (DoD) and National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST). The event will be held at the NIST campus in
Gaithersburg Maryland.

We are pleased to invite OWASP members, attendees of the Software
Assurance Forum and any other interested parties to join us for this
event.

At this day-long training, OWASP will be answering the questions of:

  - How do I get started in formulating an application security program
    using OWASP tools and resources?
  - What does OWASP have to offer for those interested in software
    assurance?
  - How do I engage with OWASP to effectively realize OWASP's potential
    and the wealth of resources OWASP makes freely available?
         (This will include upcoming OWASP events and contact
    information for local chapters in the DC/NOVA/Maryland area)

This day is a part of the [13th Semi-Annual Software Assurance
Forum](https://buildsecurityin.us-cert.gov/bsi/events/1133-BSI.html).
**The week-long event is free and open, but requires registration for
participation in any or all days of the event, including the OWASP day
on the 27th.**

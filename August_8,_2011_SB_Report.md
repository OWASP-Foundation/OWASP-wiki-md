## Industry Committee

  - Facilitated transition of of committee administrative tasks to new
    GIC Chair: Rex Booth.

**Summary of tasks:**

  - If non-OWASP email account used for contact, communicate intent to
    the committee (as well as where your contact information is listed
    on the wiki) to insure that you receive all communication.
  - Join the committee-chair mailing list:
    <https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/committees-chairs>. A link
    to the previous meeting details:
    <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Global_Committee_Chair_Meetings>
  - In addition to attending the committee chair meetings, right now it
    is expected that all committee chairs will prepare a committee
    update using the attached ppt template/format for the monthly board
    meetings as well as attend those meetings. It should be uploaded as
    a google doc and then posted to that month's Board Meeting agenda
    page at least a few days before the meeting. Email Kate to let her
    know if has been posted and to confirm whether you (committee chair)
    will be in attendance for that month's meeting. If there is
    something specific that you want/need the board to vote on at that
    month's meeting, that should be listed separately on the board
    meeting agenda.
  - Reset (or have administrator reset) the password to the GIC mailing
    list and send it to new chair. You will be the "administrator" for
    this list. Here is the link to the admin login page:
    <https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/admin/global_industry_committee>
  - The main wiki pages that need to get updated with committee
    membership applications and changes: the GIC wiki page, Global
    Committee overview wiki page, and How to Join a Committee wiki page.
    I have ensured that they are all three up-to-date as of today --
    adding your name as the committee chair, removing my name as
    operational support, and synchronizing applications.
  - Meeting preparation/invites: 1) The meeting time should be sent out
    and posted as GMT/UTC to avoid confusion with time zones... 2) I
    would send out a recurring meeting invite to the committee members.
    Send invitation to Kate as well as other individuals who have an
    interest in our committee although they aren't formal members. 3)
    Aside from the recurring meeting "calendar invite" , I make sure to
    send an announcement/general invitation to the GIC mailing list for
    public record and to catch any newcomers who may have an interest.
    4) Finally, the GIC wiki page will need to be updated with the date
    of the next meeting as well as (5) a link to the meeting agenda,
    which I try to make available (and email out to the GIC list) at
    least a couple of days before the meeting. That way the committee
    members have time to look it over and read any related documents
    BEFORE the meeting.
  - All GIC meeting minutes have been posted to the wiki (under the
    "Meetings and Getting Involved" tab) -
    <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Global_Industry_Committee#tab=Meetings_and_Getting_Involved>.
    I have tried to follow a consistent format for the meeting minute
    documentation (I took and posted the meeting minutes - but now this
    will be your job:), but you obviously are free to do as you prefer.
  - Attendance: Track [GIC meeting
    attendance](https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApZ9zE0hx0LNdHp5VE02V1hDdkFtamwwUzBMdE90b0E&hl=en_US)
    to assure compliance to the GIC governance policies.
  - Current GIC Initiatives: Generally tracked on the corresponding tab
    on the GIC wiki page there are also links to the working documents
    on the GIC Records tab. This has been a good resource to keep up to
    date and for committee members to post things they are working on.
  - AppSec 2011 Conferences - Industry Outreach: The Minutes as well as
    ppt presentations from the Industry Outreach Sessions at AppSec EU -
    Dublin are included on the GIC Records tab of the wiki. Here is a
    link to what we did on the wiki page to provide information on the
    Industry Outreach Session at AppSec EU:
    <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/AppSecEU2011/Industry_Outreach>
    (note, then I used transclusion to put the info on a tab on the
    AppSecEurope Wiki page.
  - 2011 GIC Budget - I gave you edit privileges, and this is up-to-date
    as of today. Note that this is not meant to serve as the accounting
    "authority", but meant to be a self-maintained tracking system of
    what we have spend to date. Alison is the "final say" on all things
    budget and she and Kate should be included on any emails or items
    related to expenses.

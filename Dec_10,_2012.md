conferences, and social technologies

**Community Submitted items:**

  - Remove all project leaders that have been on a project, initiative,
    committee but have done nothing (measurable) in the last 6 months -
    by Dinis Cruz (Submitted again since no response was received from
    the same request added to the [last board
    meeting](Nov_12,_2012 "wikilink")
      - a good test is just to ask: 'Dear project leader XYX, what have
        you done for the project/initiative/committee ABC over the last
        6 months.'
      - see [The difference between being 'Appointed' and being
        'Accepted' as an OWASP Leader (of its
        Fork)](http://diniscruz.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/the-difference-between-being-appointed.html)
        for more details
  - Publish the list of OWASP funds used by Chapters, Projects and
    Committees (from the funds allocated to them from the revenue split
    and Project reboot) - by Dinis Cruz

Eoin Keary has been with OWASP since 2004. He is based in Ireland and
runs a software security practice, bccriskadvisory.com and
[edgescan.com](https://www.edgescan.com)

He was on the Global Board of the OWASP foundation from 2009 to 2015. He
was the first democratically elected to the board member in 2009. During
this time Eoin assisted in founding the OWASP legal entity in Europe and
has helped provide structure to OWASPs finances and strategy.

Eoin believes the projects OWASP delivers are a key aspect of the
foundation and also very important in helping both developers and
security professionals in building more secure software.

Eoin previously lead the [OWASP Testing
Guide](OWASP_Testing_Project "wikilink") and  currently the [OWASP Code
Review Guide](OWASP_Code_Review_Guide_Table_of_Contents "wikilink") and
also contributed to other OWASP projects such as [OWASP
SAMM](OWASP_SAMM_Project "wikilink"), [OWASP CISO
Guide](OWASP_CISO_Guide "wikilink") & CISO Survey, [OWASP Cheat
sheets](OWASP_Cheat_sheets "wikilink"), and the [OWASP
ASVS](OWASP_ASVS_Assessment_tool "wikilink") &
[ZAP](OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project "wikilink") as a reviewer.

Eoin also founded the [OWASP
Ireland](OWASP_Ireland_AppSec_2009_Conference "wikilink") chapter in
2006 and the OWASP Ireland event in 2008 which is in its 4th year and
also hosted [OWASP EU](OWASP_EU "wikilink") in 2011.

Eoin believes OWASP needs to focus more on outreach to the software
development community and also involve itself more with the industries
which rely on software to achieve business and social goals by assisting
organisations, CISO's and security communities in writing and defending
software infrastructure.

To this end,  Eoin frequently delivers free technical and executive
awareness workshops to help organisations achieve their goals in a
secure manner.

## Chapter Meetings

The goal of this group is to bring together the geographically dispersed
security professionals across the Atlantic Provinces under one umbrella
to collaborate on software security and contribute to the OWASP cause.
To do this OWASP Atlantic will serve as a virtual chapter. Virtual
chapter meetings will be webinars open to anyone but with an Atlantic
Canadian focus. Of course chapter members should get together in person
whenever possible. We encourage everyone to collaborate and
self-organize local meetups where they can. As conferences and security
events take place throughout the region we will make every effort to
arrange for chapter meetups as members converge on those events. Please
join the chapter mailing list to stay in touch and to be notified of
upcoming chapter meetings and meetup opportunities.

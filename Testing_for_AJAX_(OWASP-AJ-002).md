## Brief Summary

Because most attacks against AJAX applications are analogs of attacks
against traditional web applications, testers should refer to other
sections of the testing guide to look for specific parameter
manipulations to use in order to discover vulnerabilities. The challenge
with AJAX-enabled applications is often finding the endpoints that are
the targets for the asynchronous calls and then determining the proper
format for requests.

## Description of the Issue

Traditional web applications are fairly easy to discover in an automated
fashion. An application typically has one or more pages that are
connected by HREFs or other links. Interesting pages will have one or
more HTML FORMs. These forms will have one or more parameters. By using
simple spidering techniques such as looking for anchor (A) tags and HTML
FORMs it should be possible to discover all pages, forms, and parameters
in a traditional web application. Requests made to this application
follow a well-known and consistent format laid out in the HTTP
specification. GET requests have the format:

`http://server.com/directory/resource.cgi?param1=value1&key=value`

POST requests are sent to URLs in a similar fashion:

`http://server.com/directory/resource.cgi`

Data sent to POST requests is encoded in a similar format and included
in the request after the headers:

`param1=value1&key=value`

Unfortunately, server-side AJAX endpoints are not as easy or consistent
to discover, and the format of actual valid requests is left to the AJAX
framework in use or the discretion of the developer. Therefore to fully
test AJAX-enabled applications, testers need to be aware of the
frameworks in use, the AJAX endpoints that are available, and the
required format for requests to be considered valid. Once this
understanding has been developed, standard parameter manipulation
techniques using a proxy can be used to test for SQL injection and other
flaws.

## Black Box testing and example

**Testing for AJAX Endpoints:**
Before an AJAX-enabled web application can be tested, the call endpoints
for the asynchronous calls must be enumerated. See
[Application_Discovery_AoC](Application_Discovery_AoC "wikilink") for
more information about how traditional web applications are discovered.
For AJAX applications, there are two main approaches to determine call
endpoints: parsing the HTML and JavaScript files and using a proxy to
observe traffic.

The advantage of parsing the HTML and JavaScript files in a web
application is that it can provide a more comprehensive view of the
server-side capabilities that can be accessed from the client side. The
drawback is that manually reviewing HTML and JavaScript content is
tedious and, more importantly, the location and format of server-side
URLs available to be accessed by AJAX calls are framework dependent.

The tester should look through HTML and JavaScript files to find URLs of
additional application surface exposure. Searching for use of the
XMLHttpRequest object in JavaScript code can help to focus these
reviewing efforts. Also, by knowing the names of included JavaScript
files, the tester can determine which AJAX frameworks appear to be in
use. Once AJAX endpoints have been identified, the tester should further
inspect the code to determine the format required of requests.

The advantage of using a proxy to observe traffic is that the actual
requests demonstrate conclusively where the application is sending
requests and what format those requests are in. The disadvantage is that
only the endpoints that the application actually makes calls to will be
revealed. The tester must fully exercise the remote application, and
even then there could be additional call endpoints that are available
but not actively in use. In exercising the application, the proxy should
observe traffic to both the user-viewable pages and the background
asynchronous traffic to the AJAX endpoints. Capturing this session
traffic data allows the tester to determine all of the HTTP requests
that are being made during the session as opposed to only looking at the
user-viewable pages in the application.

**Result Expected:**
By enumerating the AJAX endpoints available in an application and
determining the required request format, the tester can set the stage
for further analysis of the application. Once endpoints and proper
request formats have been determined, the tester can use a web proxy and
standard web application parameter manipulation techniques to look for
SQL injection and parameter tampering attacks.

**Intercepting and debugging JS code with Browsers**

Using normal browsers, it's possible to analyze in detail
JavaScript-based web applications.
Ajax calls in Firefox can be intercepted by using extension plugins that
monitor the code flow.
Two extensions providing this ability are "FireBug" and "Venkman
JavaScript Debugger".

For Internet Explorer, there are some tools provided by Microsoft, such
as "Script Debugger", that permits real-time JavaScript debugging.

By using FireBug on a page, a tester could find Ajax endpoints by
setting "Options-\>Show XmlHttpRequest".

From now on, any request accomplished by the XMLHttpRequest object will
be listed on the bottom of the browser.
On the right of where the URL is displayed, the source code and line
number from where the call was made are shown. And by clicking on the
displayed URL, server response is also shown.
So, it's straightforward to understand what the request and response are
and where the endpoint is.
If the link to a source script is clicked, the tester will find where
the request originates.

As debugging Javascript is the way to learn how scripts build URLs, and
how many parameters are available, by filling the form when the password
is written down and the related input tag loses its focus, a new request
is accomplished as could be seen on the following screenshot.

![Image:Firebug_3.jpg](Firebug_3.jpg "Image:Firebug_3.jpg")

Now, by clicking on the link to JavaScript source code, the tester has
access to the next endpoint.

Then by setting breakpoints on some lines near the JavaScript endpoint,
it's easy to know the call stack as shown in the next screenshot.

## Gray Box testing and example

**Testing for AJAX Endpoints:**
Access to additional information about the application source code can
greatly speed up efforts to enumerate AJAX endpoints, and the knowledge
of what frameworks are in use will help the tester to understand the
required format for AJAX requests.
**Result Expected:**
Knowledge of the frameworks being used and AJAX endpoints that are
available help the tester to focus his efforts and reduce the time
required for discovering and application footprinting.

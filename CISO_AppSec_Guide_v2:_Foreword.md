This guide has been created in alignment with OWASP core values
reflected in the openness of the content, innovative ideas and concepts,
global reach to the application security community and integrity of the
contents that are published as strictly vendor neutral and un-biased by
specific commercial interests. This guide has also been developed in
respect of the OWASP core values such as to “Promote the implementation
of and promote compliance with standards, procedures, controls for
application security” and the OWASP principles of delivering free and
open content, not for profit interests and a risk based approach for
improving application security. The leader of the OWASP Application
Security Guide for CISOS project is Marco Morana that developed the
original contents of this guide with contributions from tbd.

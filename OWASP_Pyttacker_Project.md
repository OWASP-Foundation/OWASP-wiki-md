<p>The OWASP Pyttacker Project is a portable Web Server that include the features needed for every Pentester when creating reports, helping to create PoCs that show a more descriptive way to create awareness to the businesses by demonstrating realistic but inoffensive "attacks" included as part of the tool.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Most of the time is spent on finding the bad stuff during a Web PenTest, writing reports is time consuming and you need to deliver the results as soon as possible, however in the end the one that will need to fix the issue (or push others to do it) will need to really understand the impact of the findings included in the report. When you show raw Database data from a SQLi it's very visible for your costumer that the impact is High, however when the finding need some other steps for being reproduced the impact become more complicated to be demonstrated to non technical people, just a "request" and "response" is not enough and how long are you willing to take for coding a working PoC and create a nice screenshot for being included in your report.</p>
<p>What about using "something" that is the server you mention as hypothetic 'evil.com' that can be used by the bad guys against your costumer's company, even better if you know that the evil server is not that "evil" and you have full control of it, would be nice to have "something" handy and portable for reproducing those findings and grab nice screen-shots, what about reproducing the finding during that meeting when you are trying to show the impact of your findings, not just a pop-up alert for XSS, what if you show an inoffensive but scaring partial defacement or a javascript keylogger in action.</p>
<p>Sounds good ? if yes then Pyttacker will be an interesting tool for you</p>

# Road Map and Getting Involved

As of March 2014, the priorities are:

"First Alpha version is ready but need more development time for
including features that can be delegated to newcomers since the project
is module based. The First Beta release is intended to be published on
June 2014 including the PoC modules for CSRF, XSS, Open Redirect, XFS
Next Steps:

1.  Add more PoC modules for more Vulnerabilities
2.  Add integration with tools like OWASP ZAP and Burp Suite"

Involvement in the development and promotion of Pyttacker is actively
encouraged\! You do not have to be a security expert in order to
contribute. Some of the ways you can help:

  - QA Testing

| Bug reporting

  - Content Translation
  - Plugin Development
  - Core code improvements

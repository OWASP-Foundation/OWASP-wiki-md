## The presentation

![Chris_Wysopal.jpg](Chris_Wysopal.jpg "Chris_Wysopal.jpg")Application
security metrics are valuable today yet are still evolving. The best
place to start is organizational metrics. CISOs and other security
managers should be asking the questions: What applications do I have?
What is the business criticality of those apps? What security analysis
have been performed? Once those questions are answered the next level of
metrics should be determined. What is the coverage of the different
security techniques both in breadth and depth? What testing should I
perform and how do I prioritize what to remediate and know when I am
secure. This talk will present the data to collect and how to calculate
metrics to measure and improve application security.

**Request for OPEN Quotations (RFO-Q)**

</center>

<center>

**For Website Redesign**

</center>

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is seeking competitive
quotations for a web design project hereafter described. Contractors
qualified to fulfill these requirements are invited to submit quotations
subject to OWASP approval and email <rory.mccune@owasp.org>.

## Background

The OWASP Brochureware project is an initiative to produce a set of
"marketing" pages to allow for key OWASP material to be laid out in a
user-friendly and enable our customers to get this information easily.
Whilst the wiki has proven to be a great resource for collaborative
development, the complex structure of the site can leave new users
confused about where to go to get the information they are interested
in. The goal of the project is to have a series of templates which can
be used by areas of OWASP, to create their own marketing pages which can
be added in to this site.

## Desired Deliverables

In terms of the desired look and feel, the intention is to create a
modern clean look for the pages, whilst including the relevant
information for users of the site to find key resources quickly

Wireframes for the front page and a sample secondary page have been
created, along with a potential page structure. These are intended to
provide rough ideas of how the site layout could work, not necessarily
as absolute constraints.

In terms of the design, the final goal is to have HTML markup templates
along with the relevant CSS and Javascript files. Additionally some
image files are needed for specific areas of the site.

Initially the idea would be to get imaged based mockups back for
approval and then once these are agreed, the full templates would be
created.

The intention is that specific areas of the template will be marked out
with sample text which will then allow OWASP to fill in with the
relevant content.

2 different page templates are currently envisioned as being required

  - Home page template.
  - Standard Sub-Page.


In terms of the image files mentioned there are three “communities” of
users who will be using the site, which have been called “builders”,
“breakers” and “defenders”. For each of these communities we would
like to have an image or icon which would be used in links relating to
that community (for example on the home page the intention is that each
of these communities would have a section in the middle of the page with
their image and some descriptive text).

We’re open to ideas for these images, but they should form a consistent
theme in terms of content and colors used. In terms of shape/size they
should also fit in with the existing OWASP logo.


One idea would be to theme them along the lines of

  - Builder Color - Grey Image - Castle-based (eg, castle, portcullis
    etc)
  - Breaker - Color - Red Image - Sword or weapon based
  - Defender Color - Blue Image - Shield based


As mentioned, we’re open to exploring other themes for these images.

## Questions from Potential Contractors

1.  Q. Does OWASP have a budget set - if so, what is it?
    1.  A. An indicative budget of $5000-$10000 has now been approved by
        the OWASP board (meeting minutes
        [here](https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/document/d/1CLu9aQpS7LdeX87rJ5N9cuJ-RGGVzDWf34l6gdMml7M/edit?hl=en_US&authkey=CI-U5qEP)
        )
2.  Q. What is the closing date for quotations?
    1.  A. The initial goal was to close quotations at the end of
        September, however as this is still undergoing consideration,
        the RFQ will remain open for the time being.
3.  Q. What will be the criteria for judging quotations, and who will be
    doing this?
    1.  A. Ideally we'll assemble a \*small\* panel of OWASP leaders who
        are interested/experienced in this area to judge submissions. In
        terms of criteria, current thoughts are that it would be a
        combination of portfolio/track record (ie that the company has
        delivered good designs in the past), cost (that the company can
        deliver what's required within budget), how well the designs fit
        with the specification that's been provided by OWASP (existing
        and future design docs), and how well the proposal demonstrates
        an uderstanding of these requirements.
4.  Q. What are the expected timescales for the project once the
    successful contractor is appointed?
    1.  A. Based on a number of iterations, current goal would be to
        complete the work within 8 weeks of successfully appointing a
        contractor
5.  Q.What criteria are being used to "approve" to mocks
    1.  A. This would be along the lines of a) hopefully the same OWASP
        leaders who were involved in choosing the designer and b)
        agreeing that they meet the design as specified in the winning
        proposal.
6.  Q. How will the approval process work (dealing with comments from
    the whole of OWASP would add considerably to the project's overhead)
    1.  A. Same approvals committee agree acceptance of deliverables.
7.  Q. Do the final templates have to work with any particular CMS?
    1.  A. No. Pure HTML/JS/CSS is what we're looking for, to ease
        integration with existing OWASP infrastructure.

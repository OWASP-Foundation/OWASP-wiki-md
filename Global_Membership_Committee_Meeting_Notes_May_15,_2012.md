**Honorary Membership** - Should we continue to offer honorary
membership for this year’s election?

  - Are we granting all chapter leaders honorary membership? YES = 5 No
    = 0
  - Are we granting all co-chapter leaders and chapter board members
    honorary membership? Board members: Yes = 3 No = 2. Co-leaders:
    Leader (president, board, founder, co-leaders, etc.) Yes for active
    chapter = 5 No = 0
  - Are we granting all project leaders honorary membership? Leaders Yes
    = 5. Reviewers No = 5.
  - Are we considering the “o-point” system raised at the 2010 summit?
    Dan will contact Dinis. GMC will review.
  - Are we going to use a “self-nomination” form (much to the dismay of
    the EU crowd)
      - Chapter leader - Name, year, description
      - Project leader

**\*\*\*Need votes from Ofer. Make a GMC decision**

**Lifetime/Multi-year membership for individuals and corporation?
Discount?**

  - Background: Jim Manico: $500 for 10 years.
      - 10 year: Yes = 3 , No = 1

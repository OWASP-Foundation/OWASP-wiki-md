This category is for tagging vulnerabilities that related to
cryptographic modules.

## Examples

  - Algorithm Problems
      - Insecure Algorithm
          - Use algorithms that are proven flawed or weak (DES, 3DES,
            MD5, Sha1, AES, Blowfish, Diffie Hellman)
          - Use non-standard (home-grown) algorithms
      - Choose the wrong algorithm
          - Use hash function for encryption
          - Use encryption algorithm for hashing
      - Inappropriate use of an algorithm
          - Use insecure encryption modes (DES EBC)
          - Initial vector is not random
      - Implementation errors
          - Use non-standard cryptographic implementations/libraries
  - Key Management Problems
      - Weak keys
          - Too short or not random enough
          - Use human chosen passwords as cryptographic keys
      - Key disclosure
          - Keys not encrypted during storage or transmission
          - Keys not cleaned appropriately after use
          - Keys Hard-coded in the code or stored in configuration files
      - Key updates
          - Allow keys aging
  - Random Number Generator (RNG) Problems
      - Poor random number generators (c: rand(), Java:
        java.util.Random())
      - Forget to seed the random number generator
      - Use the same seed for the random number generator every time
      - Sniffing

## About

The OWASP Oracle Project's goal is to enable administrator and
developers using Oracle databases, frameworks or tooling to build secure
applications efficiently.

## Joining the Project

Marinus J. Kuivenhoven leads the project. The project's high level
roadmap can be found at the [OWASP Oracle Project
Roadmap](OWASP_Oracle_Project_Roadmap "wikilink")

# Oracle Security Overview

## Why Oracle Security???

  - Architects
    With Oracle now supporting the grid computing architecture, security
    has spread from one machine to several, which increases the chance
    on a vulnerability.

<!-- end list -->

  - Administrators
    Oracle is not the fastest releaser of patches, but because of the
    complexity of most systems, also DBA's often take their time to
    patch the system, because they don't want to break a running
    application. Also Oracle is great at enabling a lot of features by
    default, if you don't know what they do and which you really need,
    you could have a lot more vulnerabilities than you could handle. A
    DBA simply needs to understand who is accessing their database and
    how it is done.

<!-- end list -->

  - Developers
    Legacy frameworks like Oracle Designer and Oracle Forms have
    built-in support for making a SQL injection, even when working in a
    non webbased enviroment. The newer framesworks (like ADF and
    Application Express) are great in making it easy to develop database
    oriented applications. But they are meta-frameworks, which makes
    understanding what is going on on a lower level, virtually
    impossible for most developers.

<!-- end list -->

  - Deployers
    Since most DBA's are now unintended Web- and ASadministrators, their
    knowledgde is small and one-sided.

<!-- end list -->

  - Testers
    Even though the old Oracle products are well known and the newer
    ones are J2EE based, their possibilties are not that well
    documented, so finding vulnerabilities for most testers will be a
    lot harder than say a .net enviroment.

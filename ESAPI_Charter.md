## ESAPI Charter

The goal of the OWASP ESAPI Project is to ensure:

`  strong simple security controls are available`
`  to every developer in every environment`

  - Strong:Strong controls do not contain vulnerabilities and provide
    complete protection against the threats they were designed for.

<!-- end list -->

  - Simple:Controls that are not easy to use will most likely be misused
    by developers and create vulnerability

<!-- end list -->

  - Available:Controls are available if they are present in the
    developer's environment in a way that makes them easy and obvious to
    use. The goal of the ESAPI project is not to replace good security
    controls that are already available in programming environments. Nor
    is it our goal to make developers access security controls directly.
    It's even better if the controls are already present or are
    integrated into a framework in a way that is invisible or automatic
    to developers.

<!-- end list -->

  - Every Developer:It is difficult to imagine a developer that does not
    need a set of basic security controls in their environment, from
    students to senior architects.

<!-- end list -->

  - Every Environment:Our initial target is server-side web
    environments, then we plan to extend to both web service
    environments and client side frameworks, and eventually other
    non-web programming environments.

## Coverage

Obviously we cannot provide security controls in every environment all
at once. Therefore, we've decided to focus on several key software
environments that are widely used and we will expand the list over time.
Here is our current scorecard:

Ball *'
*' Maty Siman, Checkmarx '''
Over several years applications have become central to anything we do.
Whether web, mobile or even IoT applications, they all control almost
every aspect of our daily lives. For that exact same reason they have
also become the hacker’s new best friend. But it seems that there is a
change happening and it isn’t being discussed as often as it should.
Data and financial gain is still considered the end goal but the how is
dramatically changing.

Join us to try to envision what kind of attacks we will be seeing in the
near future, how and who will be taking or dropping responsibility and
how modern development practices may benefit attack techniques.

''' 18:30 - Automated security tests using ZAP and Webdriver.io *'

Webdriver.io is a great framework for writing automation tests for your
webapp. With a very small configuration you can easily integrate ZAP\`s
passive scan into those tests, and upgrade those tests into automated
security scanning – by enjoying from all the useful things that ZAP is
able to detect. I am going to cover how we did this at Soluto – and as
we run everything using Docker containers, it is very easy to reproduce
this setup for any webapp with existing Webdriver.io/Selenium tests.

''' 19:15 – Coffee break '''

''' 19:30 – WebShell AV signature bypass and identification *'

Ever wondered how easy or hard it is to trick a signature based
defensive product? Ever wanted to bypass such a product to upload your
own malicious web-shell file to an attacked web server? This lecture is
for you\! In a very lightweight, straightforward and eye-opening talk
I’m going to show how easy it is to upload a slightly modified version
of the famous C99 webshell, to get full control over a web server, and
how ineffective are signature based modules of defensive products. I’m
also going to show tips on how to identify a web-shell, and present 2
open-source tools that try to do just that.

# Front Range OWASP Conference 2012 (FROC) Call for Presentations

On Thursday March 22nd 2012, OWASP (Open Web Application Security
Project) will hold its "Front Range OWASP Conference (FROC)" in Denver,
Colorado.

The Conference consists of a single day of Application Security sessions
and we anticipate 3 different tracks for these sessions (Intermediate,
Expert and Management).

In the past, FROC has attracted a packed venue with our great
Application Security speakers, and we hope to achieve the same again in
2012. This year we organized the conference to occur during the peak of
the spring ski season, so that speakers can head up to the nearby
mountains after the conference to enjoy some great snow activities.

## Topics

We are seeking presentations on any of the following topics:

  - Web Services and Application Security
  - Common Application related Threats and Risks
  - Business Risks with Application Security
  - Cloud Security
  - Exploits and Vulnerabilities
  - Mobile Security
  - Web Application Penetration Testing
  - OWASP Tools and Projects
  - Secure Coding Practices
  - Technology specific presentations on security such as AJAX, XML,
    etc.
  - Anything else relating to OWASP and Application Security

## Dates and Deadlines

The official closing date for receiving a synopsis of the presentation
is February 23rd, 2012, with announcements on selected candidates to be
provided by March 1st, 2012. Complete presentations must be submitted by
March 15th, 2012.

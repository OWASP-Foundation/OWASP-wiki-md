**We cant hack ourselves secure.** Penetration testing is generally a
point in time test. As source code changes the value of the findings of
a penetration test degrade with time. There are also privacy, compliance
and stability and availability concerns which are generally not covered
by penetration testing. Data information leakage in a cloud environment
for example may not be discovered via a penetration test.

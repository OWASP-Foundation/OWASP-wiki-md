## **Agenda**

## 16:45 - 17:05 : Gathering, Mingling & Refreshments

## 17:05 - 17:10 : Opening Notes

**Ofer Maor, Hacktics**

## 17:10 - 17:20 : Opening Notes

**Avi Brener, Amdocs**

## 17:20 - 18:00 : Cloud Security Topics

**Shalom Carmel, Venera**

As more and more services move into the cloud, security of these
resources becomes significant. In this lecture Shalom will review
various topics relating to cloud security, including:

  - Short Introduction to XaaS
  - Challenges in Cloud Security - Management, Process, Data,
    Communications, Connection to Enterprise
  - Differences Between Security of Leading Cloud Providers
  - Regulation in the Cloud - Is It Feasible?

## 18:00 - 18:35 : SaaS as a Security Hazard: The Google Docs Example

**Ofer Shezaf, Better Place**

As the borderline between a web site and an application blurs, so does
the division between the enterprise IT and the internet. More and more
enterprises adapt core applications which are provided as a service over
the Internet. Until recently those where limited to vertical
applications such as salesforce.com for sales automation and monster.com
for recruiting, both of which have already suffered major security
issues that compromises customer data. Google software push has led to
enterprise adaption of general purpose cloud services including office
tools, mail and knowledge management, which presents an entirely new
risk level.

In this presentation we will discuss the security risks unique to SaaS
(Software as a service) and some past attacks on such services. We will
than dissect the security implications of using Google sites (which
includes Google docs and Gmail) as an example for a SaaS. We will go
over a checklist of things to examine in a SaaS before subscribing to
ensure that it provides sufficient security and will discuss the
solutions offered (or not) by Google to the items listed.

## 18:35 - 19:10 : SAML

**David Movshovitz**

SAML is one of the protocols that have been developed to secure web
services, and has been become very popular especially to implement Web
SSO and SaaS SSO. In the lecture we will describe the principals of the
protocol and demonstrate how it is used to implement Web SSO.

## 19:10 - 19:40 : XSHM - Cross Site History Manipulation

**Alex Roichman, Checkmarx**

In this presentation I will introduce a newly discovered SOP (Same
Origin Policy) security breach identified as Cross-Site History
Manipulation (XSHM). Cross-Site History Manipulation breach is based on
our research findings that the client-side browser history object is not
properly partitioned on a per-site basis. Manipulating browser history
may lead to SOP compromising, allow bi-directional CSRF and other
exploitations such as: user privacy violation, login status detection,
resource mapping, sensitive information inferring, users' activity
tracking and URL parameter stealing. In the presentation I will show how
XSHM can be executed, what applications are vulnerable to it, how to
detect the flaw and consequently remediate it.**<u>

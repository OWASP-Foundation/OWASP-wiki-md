## Letter to Community to Start Cleanup

OWASP Community,

We need your volunteerism and subject matter expertise to help us clean
up the OWASP wiki. This task is for the intellectual juggernaut, the
mentally brave, and those who are willing to dig in when faced with a
mountain of outdated and disorganized wiki pages about application
security. We appreciate your help on this task a great deal and consider
this to be a necessary ongoing effort, not a static endeavor.

1.  Please start by reading some of the wiki-editors archive
    <http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-wiki-editors/> to see our
    conversations and how our decisions evolved.
2.  Next, please review the templates for labeling.
    1.  Template 1 for labeling content as needs deleting, historical,
        inactiveDraft, merge, old, partialOld or pls_review:
        <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Template:TaggedDocument>
    2.  Template 2 for labeling good content as being reviewed:
        <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Template:Reviewed>
3.  Please use the categories described below [\#Wiki Categories used
    for Cleanup](#Wiki_Categories_used_for_Cleanup "wikilink") to tag
    pages in progress. Some pages may be generic tagged (tagged with no
    attribution) for review - unsure whats wrong, but needs someone to
    look at it. Additionaly there is a "popular" category to label up to
    date content that still needs frequent review.
    <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Popular> , which is a
    common Category but not one used for the cleanup.
4.  As you move forward and work on content, some wiki pages just need
    to be tagged in some way, some wiki pages will need to REDIRECTED to
    other more relevant content, some wiki pages content great but
    incomplete work and will need to be finished or updated in some way.
5.  Also consider just grinding through the FixME pages - lots of
    deprecated content here that needs tagging.
    <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:FIXME>
6.  Anther approach is to hit google for different OWASP projects and
    see what pops up first, and update or deprecate those pages so we
    can clean up more higher priority items.
7.  Another approach is to pick a topic (like XSS, or SQL Injection) and
    search for all pages on those items, and see if anything can be
    merged. Post anything you find to the owasp-wiki-editors list.
    Please use the "merge" template label for pages of this kind.
8.  When you do see duplicate content that needs merging, consider
    merging into one page and redirect the old page to the new merged
    page. Redirecting is better than deleting since it preserves search
    engine points of entry.
9.  This is still a work in progress, so please any other advice here is
    appreciated. Join us at

## Wiki Cleanup Notes

1.  What's the problem (describe a few google searches that lead to out
    of date OWASP wiki pages)
    1.  <https://www.google.com/search?q=top+10+owasp+attacks+xss>:
        Shows links to 2013, 2010, and 2007 T10
    2.  <https://www.owasp.org/index.php?search=malicious&title=Special%3ASearch>:
        Shows 2007 T10 hits
2.  What's some good ways to keep an eye on this better moving forward
    (like tagging popular pages for more careful review)
3.  Describe the tagging system for legacy, dead or good content content
    that needs updating, etc...
4.  Describe a few search mechanisms to find content that needs review
    and tagging
5.  Leverage the community to help us update the wiki\!

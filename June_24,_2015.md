## Old Business

All active board proposals are listed
[here](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BxSfMVkfLvslVXdvUFV3NkxucWc&usp=sharing)

  - Bylaws (pre-reading material: [By Laws
    v7](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RnVbx6DXX3tGcFWlrSxyn8NDKPQEYbTcACJR0oCuyaI/edit#heading=h.rye1xpr37ksy%7COWASP))

Discuss revised by laws, approve, reword or reject changes to bring our
by laws into good standing before the election.

  - Fund ring fencing

Discuss how we ensure that all of our strategic goals are properly
funded, and ensure that the Foundation doesn't need to borrow when we
have funds on hand. Chapters have 71% of OWASP's funds ring fenced.
Let's discuss how we deliver all of OWASP's strategic goals, and improve
our admin cost overhead ratio.

  - On Demand Training (pre-reading material link above)

At OWASP we are frequently receiving requests from companies looking for
training related to application security. This is an area of expertise
that plenty of individuals in our Community could fulfil. This growing
demand for training is aligned with OWASP Strategic Goals and will
become a much needed revenue stream for the Foundation that is not
conference driven. Discuss revised proposal for OWASP to
deliver/organise trainings.

  - \[Tobias\] - reopen communication with RSA to explore potential

      - \[discussion topic\]
  - \[Matt\] - hire a technical editor for a few months.
      - \[discussion topic\]
  - \[Jim\] - Making public statements on crypto
      - "Even though 501c3 organizations \*can\* do some lobbying (as
        long as expenditures are not substantial), the IAB is careful
        not to talk about legislation or urge anyone to contact
        representatives about legislation." - Jeff Willams
  - \[Josh\] - Funding request for Project Summit at AppSecUSA 2015
      - <http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-leaders/2015-June/014359.html>
      - $10,000 requested
  - \[Jim\] - Different Board voting models
      - We have both email and in-person voting models which are very
        different. For email, all members can vote. For in person, only
        present members may vote. Should me merge this into one model
        only?

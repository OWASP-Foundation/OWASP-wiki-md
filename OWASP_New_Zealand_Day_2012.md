# Introduction

## Introduction

We are proud to announce the fourth annual OWASP New Zealand Day
conference, to be held at the University of Auckland on Friday August
31st, 2012. OWASP New Zealand Day is a one-day conference dedicated to
web application security, with an emphasis on secure development
techniques to help Kiwi developers build more secure applications.

Based on feedback from last year, the structure of the conference will
be slightly different this time.

  - We will be offering training on the day before the conference
    (Thursday August 30th) rather than at the same time as the
    conference.
  - After lunch on the conference day, we will split to two tracks - one
    focused on deep technical topics, the other on policy, compliance
    and risk management.

The fourth OWASP New Zealand Day will be happening thanks to the support
provided by the University of Auckland School of Business, which will
kindly offer the same conference venue of the last three years. Entry to
the event will, as in the past, be free.

For any comments, feedback or observations, please don't hesitate to
contact [us](mailto:nick.freeman@owasp.org?cc=adrian.hayes@owasp.org).

### Teaching the Good-Guys Bad-Tricks - OWASP Top 10 in real-life

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

"I'm taught and I forget, I do and I remember" is particularly true with
web-security. At this session you will have web-security and insecurity
clearly explained and we'll walk through clear examples. But not only
will you learn the OWASP Top 10 but you will also hand-craft your own
attacks. In our fully functional hack-lab websites you will have a

# Speakers List

## Speakers List

### Adam Bell - in2securITy - How do I get into Security? I'm a webdev\! (An introduction to in2securITy)

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

A brief introduction to in2securITy, it's aims and goals. A particular
focus on the availability of mentoring, peers and the secure development
stream.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Adam Bell is a security consultant with two years experience in the
security industry backed by a further seven years experience in other IT
industries. In this time he has worked for both local and national
governments in network defence roles as well as working in more
generalised system administration, programming, and (the dreaded)
service centre. He currently works for Lateral Security and is the
Network Defence writer for in2security.

### Andrew Kelly - Comply or Die Trying

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

We all have to comply with something: Laws or bylaws - regulations or
recommendations - industry standards or industry best-practice. This
OWASP talk will focus on the 'real-world' application of security policy
and compliance in IT and business. How policy and compliance can
actually be very useful when it comes to securing your job, your company
- and your company's future. Both from an IT - and a business/commercial
prospective. And - along the way - some common myths, misconceptions and
downright misunderstandings around policy and compliance may well be
busted. Come and listen to a guy who actually thinks compliance and
policy ... are fun\!

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Andrew brings 27 years IT experience to OWASP - 24 of them in IT
Security - and 13 of those spent in the UK and Europe (okay ...
Belgium). Now despite starting out as a mainframe uber-tech - Andrew's
recognised today as being a 'pragmatic' subject-matter expert on
corporate information security policy, compliance and governance. Andrew
created his first BS 7799-compliant security policy - for a credit card
provider - in Cardiff back in 1999. Since then he's done much the same
for the a number of security consultancies (NZ and UK), Fonterra,
Transpower and Telecom (NZ) - and BT, Deutsche Bank, Lloyds/TSB Bank and
Legal & General Assurance (UK) - amongst many others.

### Andy Prow and Sam Pickles - Aura and F5 - Web Application Firewalls - Going where no WAFs have gone before...

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

So we all know that WAFs (web application firewalls) are not the silver
bullet they're often sold as. Many of us in the pen-testing space
completely discount their value as dumb signature based systems that are
bypassed with a flurry of keystrokes and encoding. BUT WAFs are getting
MUCH smarter, and you may be really interested to see what a really
intelligent WAF can do today. Ever thought a WAF could stop attacks
against business logic flaws and broken authorisation?

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Andy Prow is an IT Security Consultant, Trainer and software developer
who founded Aura back in 2001. With 18 years in the IT industry Andy has
developed code for IBM, Vodafone, Telecom and Microsoft. Andy presents
around the world at conferences including Microsoft's TechEd

Sam Pickles is a senior engineer and security specialist with F5
Networks. During over twelve years of security industry experience, Sam
has designed and built IT security systems; and conducted network,
application and hardware penetration testing in many countries. Sam
studied Physics at the University of Otago, and Computer Science at the
University of Oxford; and has presented at events including ISIG, First
Tuesday, OWASP and AusCERT.

### Brett Moore - Insomnia Security - Increasing The Value of Penetration Testing

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

Penetration testing has become fairy accepted now as part of the
requirements of any new project. Is it really part of a company's
security practices, or is it just a tick in the box? This presentation
will examine how effective this is for organisations and how it can best
be used to increase the usefulness from this type of work.

  - What is, and what isn't penetration testing
  - How cost effective is this method as a security measure?
  - How should it fit into the software development lifecycle of any
    application or network?
  - what you should look for in a company doing this work
  - what part of the work can you do yourselves

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Having conducted vulnerability assessments, network reviews, and
penetration tests for the majority of the large companies in New
Zealand, Insomnia founder Brett Moore brings with him over ten years
experience in information security. During this time, Brett has also
worked with companies such as SUN Microsystems, Skype Limited and
Microsoft Corporation by reporting and helping to fix security
vulnerabilities in their products. Brett has released numerous
whitepapers and technical postings related to security issues and has
spoken at security conferences both locally and overseas, including
BlackHat, Defcon, Syscan, Kiwicon, Ruxcon, and the invitation only
Microsoft internal security conference called BlueHat.

### Dean Carter and Shahn Harris - Lateral Security - An (Unofficial) OWASP Top 10 for Managers

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

The OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks has done a fantastic job
at a technical level.

Dean and Shahn have decided to turn their attention to the layer above
and create a Top 10 for Managers.

10 things to assist Managers in ensuring that their web application
projects are delivered in a secure, measurable, repeatable manner.

Oh… and they don’t cost a lot….

### Denis Andzakovic - Security-Assessment.com - The Dos and Don'ts of Web Application Frameworks

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

"Don't roll your own" has been common advice over the past decade;
however even when heeding these words, insecure practices and common
mistakes lead to glaring security holes. This talk will cover some of
the common errors made when implementing applcations based around web
frameworks, where to look for vulnerabilities and how to avoid them.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Denis is a Security Consultant for Security-Assessment.com, a security
consultancy based in Auckland, Wellington, and Singapore.

### Francois Marier - Mozilla - Defeating Cross-Site Scripting with Content Security Policy

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities are very common in web
applications. They have been in the OWASP top 10 for a while and are
routinely used by attackers.

There are simple guidelines that one can follow to prevent XSS bugs and
most of the web frameworks out there offer some level of protection but
at the end of the day, it's easy to make a mistake.

Content Security Policy adds another layer to a website's defenses:
browser-enforced restrictions against external resources or unauthorized
scripting. An extra response header instructs browsers to enforce a
policy set by the server administrator.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Francois is a software engineer on the Mozilla Identity team where he
works on Persona, the new decentralized authentication system for the
open web. A long time Debian developer, Francois has been involved in
Open Source and web development for a while and has always had a strong
interest in security.

### Kirk Jackson and Mike Haworth - Xero and Aura - Going Down to the Wire

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

You've built the flashiest web app your cow-orkers have ever seen. Your
boss loves you, and nominates you for a promotion next financial year.
You've leveraged the latest hip web framework, and have jaxed your ajax
to the max.

But have you done everything you can to make your application secure?
Are you perhaps, in fact, doing a little _too much_?

A common issue we've come across in the past few years is applications
that share too much information over the wire, or trust too much of what
they receive. In this talk we'll look at some common pitfalls and
techniques to counter them in modern web applications.

Let's go down to the wire.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Kirk works at Xero as a Security Architect, co-hosts the Wellington .NET
user group, and is a Microsoft Developer Security MVP. He has previous
experience in building and penetration testing large web applications.

Mike has previously spoken at OWASP and Kiwicon. He is a contributor to
the BeEF project and spends his days pentesting for Aura Information
Security.

### Laura Bell - Lateral Security and Britta Offergeld – Royal New Zealand Foundation of the Blind - Blindsided by Security - The Reality of Web Security for the Visually Impaired

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

Digital self-defence is now seen as a valuable life skill. As web
developers we try to design systems that can protect as well as provide
for our clients. As security consultants, we develop guidelines and
frameworks that people can use to decide if a web application is
trustworthy and secure. Even the least technical home users are becoming
more confident in spotting suspicious behaviour online. Unfortunately,
for the visually impaired, it’s not that simple. In a world where visual
clues are not enough and where additional technologies such as screen
readers are business as usual – web security is a very different matter.

Lateral Security and The Royal New Zealand Foundation of the Blind will
examine the guidance and security best practice commonly in use for web
applications today and how effective they are for those with visual
impairments. In a talk that mixes real world examples, demonstrations
and discussion from both a usability and security perspective, we aim to
not only outline the issues but also suggest some solutions.

### Nick von Dadelszen - Lateral Security - Mobile NFC 101

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

This talk is designed to provide a detailed understanding of NFC on
mobile phones and security considerations associated with the
technology.

The participants should leave the presentation with an understanding of
the technology behind NFC on mobile phones and how it interacts. They
should obtain an understanding of the security considerations for NFC on
Mobile and how it differs from standard NFC implementations.

The agenda for the talk will be the following: - Introduce the audience
to NFC - Discuss the current state of NFC on mobile phones - Analyse the
technology involved and how this is used to develop NFC applications -
Discuss the security considerations of NFC on mobile devices

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Nick von Dadelszen is the technical director at Lateral Security. Nick
has been performing professional pen testing for over 12 years and has
managed several successful penetration testing teams. He has worked with
the majority of large corporates and Government agencies in New Zealand
and is a regular presenter at OWASP and kiwicon conferences.

### Quintin Russ - SiteHost - Internet Junk

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

Junk, we all have it. Some have more, a lot more ... Whether you have
accepted your Trademe addiction or are still in denial we all have a
problem. Just like Space we are filling up the Internet with junk. What
happens to our websites when we are finished with them? How are they
closed? Are they ever closed? This talk will look at what sort of junk
is left behind and how this can be used to attack your organisation. We
will cover the issues with real world examples and time allowing,
discuss simple steps to help overcome your Trademe addiction should you
have one.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Quintin has carved out his own niche in the .nz hosting industry, having
spent a large proportion of the last few years becoming an expert in
both building and defending systems. He now runs enough infrastructure
to ensure he never, ever gets a good night's sleep, and sometimes
doesn't even get to snooze through Sunday mornings. Quintin has a keen
interest in security, especially as it relates to web hosting. This has
ranged from the vicissitudes of shared hosting to code reviews of
popular blogging applications. He has previously presented at ISIG,
OWASP & Kiwicon.

# Call For Sponsorships

## Call For Sponsorships

As mentioned above, OWASP New Zealand Day 2012 will be held in Auckland
on the 31st of August, 2012. OWASP New Zealand Day is a security
conference entirely dedicated to web application security. The
conference is once again being hosted by the University of Auckland with
their support and assistance. OWASP New Zealand Day 2012 is a free
event, but requires sponsor support to help be an instructive and
quality event for the New Zealand community. OWASP is strictly non for
profit. The sponsorship money will be used to help make OWASP New
Zealand Day 2012 a free, compelling and valuable experience for the
audience.

The sponsorship funds collected are to be used for things such as:

  - Refreshments (coffee break/lunch) - we want to keep people refreshed
    during the day; while we certainly bring good and interesting
    speakers, we don't want people to go home when they become hungry.
  - Name tags - we feel that getting to know people within the New
    Zealand community is important, and name tags make that possible.
  - Promotion - up to now our events are propagating by word of mouth.
    We would like to get to a wider audience by advertising our events.
  - Printed Materials - printed materials will include brochures, tags
    and lanyards.

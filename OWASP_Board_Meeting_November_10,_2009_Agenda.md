Special Update from the OWASP SUMMIT

  - A vote was taken of the OWASP SUMMIT attendees on the issue of
    whether to go forward with the idea of an OWASP Credit Card. The
    idea would lead to some amount of revenue for OWASP and possibly
    some publicity. The actual amount of revenue was not known. The
    issue of possible negative publicity in the case of a breach was
    also discussed. Many thought the credit card idea was "separate"
    from OWASP, since it's not in our space like certification would be.
    Nevertheless, there was concern that the idea was too commercial.
    The point was made that in order to be financially successful, OWASP
    would have to promote the credit card, and that would be distracting
    and undermine our reputation. In the end, the vote was AGAINST going
    forward with the OWASP Credit Card. Thanks to those involved with
    doing the research on identifying this opportunity, it was valuable
    to have explored and helps us clarify our values.

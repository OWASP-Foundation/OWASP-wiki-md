The Code Review guide is the result of initially contributing and
leading the Testing Guide. Initially, it was thought to place Code
review and testing into the same guide; it seemed like a good idea at
the time. But the topic called security code review got too big and
evolved into its own stand-alone guide.

The Code Review guide was started in 2006. The Code Review team consists
of a small, but talented, group of volunteers who should really get out
more often.

The team noticed that organizations with a proper code review functions
integrated into the software development lifecycle (SDLC) produced
remarkably better code from a security standpoint. This observation has
borne out in practice, as many security vulnerabilities are easier to
find in the code than by using other techniques.

By necessity, this guide does not cover all languages; it mainly focuses
on .NET and Java, but has a little C/C++ and PHP thrown in also.
However, the techniques advocated in the book can be easily adapted to
almost any code environment. Fortunately, the security flaws in web
applications are remarkably consistent across programming languages.

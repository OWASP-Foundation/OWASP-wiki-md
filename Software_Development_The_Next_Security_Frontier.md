"Owasp_logo_normal.jpg")With over 70% of security vulnerabilities
existing at the application layer (Gartner Group, 2005), the landscape
of security is changing. The vulnerability of software continues to
increase as criminals continue to proliferate attacks. Writing secure
code isn’t the only answer. Combating the problem of insecure software
requires a combination of policy, process and people. This presentation
will cover what it takes to build secure software and explore developing
a professional standard for software development.

# Agenda

## Current Meeting

  - Do we have a new Board Rep? If so, whom from our two additional
    board members are staying on? How does that work?

-----

  - Discussion of 2009's achievements and Action Plan for 2010.

  - The [**OWASP Top Ten
    Project**](:Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project "wikilink")'s project
    leader has invited M. Boberski to review the project against the
    [assessment criteria 2.0](Assessment_Criteria_v2.0 "wikilink").
      - As a result, M. Boberski has raised a set of questions about the
        criteria. Please see them
        [**here**](http://docs.google.com/View?id=dcn8962c_63fgm7gbfd).
      - Dinis has built a FAQ wiki page to answer M.and to more broadly
        make our responses available for future assessment criteria's
        users. The FAQ wiki page can be accessed
        [**here**](Assessment_Criteria_v2.0_FAQ "wikilink").
      - Please find the spare cycles to help to answer the above
        referred questions.

  - Regarding the creation of covers for OWASP Books, Brad proposes we
    move the process to a volunteer, without buying the source files.

    agreement](http://docs.google.com/View?id=dcn8962c_66cscznqzk).

## From Previous Meeting/Follow up

  - Reviewers Drive:
      - [Brad's
        Post](http://globalprojectscommittee.wordpress.com/2009/11/27/new-drive-for-project-reviewers/),
      - Next phase?
          - Maybe the next phases of this process could consist in
            pushing it forward by using [**this
            page**](OWASP_Project_Reviewers_Database "wikilink") to
            describe the review job role and, thereafter, by doing a
            call for reviewers through our leaders' mailing list.

-----

  - Spreading [OWASP Project Details
    Tab](:Template:OWASP_Project_Identification_Tab "wikilink") through
    [ALL OWASP Projects](OWASP_Projects_Dashboard "wikilink").
      - Revised\&improved wiki code to link projects and releases - Has
        this task been finished? Are there any available
        instructions/documentation?

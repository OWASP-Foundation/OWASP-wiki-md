As you consider how to cast your vote for the newly created 6th OWASP
Board Member, I thought I'd put a bit about down about my past
involvement with OWASP and where I think OWASP should be heading in
future.

## Future directions for OWASP

I'd break my thoughts on the future direction of OWASP into two distinct
areas: Long term direction and goals & short term specific items.

### Long Term Direction and Goals

  - Increase the OWASP community
      - OWASP needs to work on the following issues to maximize its
        community
          - Identify how to divide the community into teams
              - These would be 'below' the Global Committee level but
                above members/chapter leads/project leads
              - Teams would also help to further diversify the community
              - e.g. a graphics team, marketing team, ...
          - Find a clear and effective method for the teams, global
            committees and the board to communicate
              - Its hard for Global Committee members to communicate
                with the board as a group – the list is closed.
              - Good clear communication channels are paramount for
                OWASP to scale upwards
          - Make sure that OWASP is a compelling choice for potential
            projects/chapters
              - Find and fulfill the needs of project/chapter leaders
              - Show and/or list the reasons why you'd want to host a
                project at OWASP or start a local chapter
                  - Bring this message outside our community to other
                    related groups – programming conferences, software
                    engineering groups, ...
          - Reach out to other related groups to increase the community
              - People in our target audiences can be brought into the
                fold
              - Coders, Testers, Auditors, Project Managers, Industry,
                ISVs, ...
              - How many IT things have web-based management interfaces?
                Those companies are potential members, contributors, or
                users.
          - Better define the scope of the Global Committees and the
            newly created teams (mentioned above)
          - Demonstrate, list and otherwise encourage the use of the
            opportunities offered by joining the OWASP community
          - Produce a Code of Conduct for the community
              - Sets expectations for the community as to how discourse
                should occur.
              - Will become increasingly important as the community
                grows
      - Tailor appeals to specific audiences - including grouping
        projects for various audiences
          - Coders
          - Testers
          - Auditors
          - Project Managers
          - Industry (ala PCI)
  - Set a specific direction from the board
      - Short, medium and long term goals
          - Get someone external in to work with the board
              - I have a source for this who is willing to work only for
                direct expenses and who has consulted with boards of
                fortune 500 companies
          - Deliverable from this meeting are the goals for the short,
            medium and long term
      - Ensures that the work of the global committees is in line with
        OWASP as a whole
      - Provides a yardstick to measure OWASP's progress overall
  - Education is HUGE
      - OWASP CBT (computer-based training) project would be a huge plus
        for OWASP
      - University program need more effort/focus
      - In University is the best time to reach programmers
  - Industry is HUGE
      - Really need to drill into the issue of what OWASP can do to
        demonstrate value to businesses
          - When businesses see this, they'll have a reason to be a
            sponsor.
          - Find examples of “what they are buying”
          - Find places where OWASP provided 80% to 90% of what they
            need-
          - e.g. A previous employer funded the GPL'ed development of
            Moodle's individual class backup system because that was a
            required feature. Since the rest was already free, total
            acquisition cost was only $5,000. Those are easy 'sales' to
            business for support.
      - Industry includes Government
          - Based on what I saw at AppSec Brasil, governments are
            starting to value app sec
          - OWASP would like find great traction with government outside
            the big two (non-US, non-EU) as happened in Brasil
          - Government is also starting to see the value in open content
            and open source.

### Short Term Specific Items

  - OWASP Archive & web hosting in general
      - For details on this,see "Currently Working on for OWASP below
  - Sub-domaining owasp.org
      - Bring more projects 'closer to home' while increasing project
        leaders freedom to experiment
      - For details on this,see "Currently Working on for OWASP below
  - Re-think creating OWASP forums
      - OWASP is loosing a ton of good content in mailman posts
      - Many people will become 'contributors' by answering forum posts
      - OWASP forums as an open and free version of Experts exchange for
        application security
      - Forums as an initial draw of people into the larger OWASP
        community

## Past involvement with OWASP

**OWASP Live CD – SoC 2008 to present**
There have been \~300,000 downloads of the OWASP Live CD since I first
made my version available last fall. The OWASP Live CD is available as
an ISO image and VM images for VMware and VirtualBox.

**OWASP Podcast “roving reporter”**
I've helped Jim Manico with the OWASP podcast by recording interviews at
various conferences or over Skype. So far, I've done AppSec EU 2009, a
couple of individual interviews and will be at AppSec DC 2009 with mic
in hand.

**OWASP Global Projects Committee (GPC)**
I joined the GPC after the Portugal Summit. I've been very active in the
GPC and was the principal author of the Assessment Criteria v2.

**3 OWASP Testing Guide classes**
I've created and will donate 3 classes on the OWASP Testing Guide. There
are 1, 2 and 5 day versions of the class. Each class includes a
schedule, handouts, slides, labs and 2 VirtualBox VM images – the OWASP
Live CD and a server with vulnerable web applications called “Attack Me,
Ltd.” These will be donated to the Education project at AppSec DC 2009.

**Presentations about OWASP**

  - OWASP Austin Chapter on Securing Sensitive Configuration Data in
    .Net
  - TRISC 2009 (Austin) on the OWASP Live CD
  - DHS Software Assurance Workship (D.C) on the OWASP Live CD
  - ISSA Austin Chapter on Open Source Tools for Security
  - AppSec EU 2009 (Poland) on the OWASP Live CD & OWASP ROI
  - AppSec Academia (UC Irving) on the OWASP Live CD
  - OWASP Austin Chapter on OWASP ROI
  - AppSec Brazil 2009 on OWASP ROI
  - AppSec D.C. 2009 on the OWASP Live CD

## Currently working on

  - **OWASP Archive** – I'm working with the Open Source Labs to
    determine if OWASP could use their services to host an FTP mirror.
    The mirror would include the latest releases of all OWASP projects.
    It could also be expanded to hold conference material such as
    presentations and videos. The OWASP Archive would remove the risk of
    the project releases becoming unavailable should the project lead
    decide to no longer maintain the project. This is especially true
    for those projects which use non-owasp.org hosts to deliver their
    project files.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Sub-domaining www.owasp.org** – I'm looking into the possibility
    of offering sub-domains of owasp.org to projects which have
    traditionally been hosted externally. Beyond being a nice perk to
    projects, this would allow projects that need more then the wiki can
    offer a method of remaining on owasp.org but offering extra options
    to their users. Some possible sub-domains that come to mind are
    o2.owasp.org, esapi.owasp.org, samm.owasp.org and livecd.owasp.org.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Converting the OWASP Live CD from SLAX to Ubuntu**. This will
    allow for a much more robust and flexible Live CD. For each addition
    to the Live CD, a separate .deb package will be created and an
    apt-get'able repository will be created. The conversion will also
    allow for easy custom versions of the Live CD – for example, an
    OWASP ESAPI version could be created with ESAPI, the J2EE reference
    implementation, Eclipse and Swingset. This could be offered as an
    ISO or VM image.

Portugal**

OWASP, the Open Web Application Security Project, is teaming up with
browser development teams to increase the security of the World Wide
Web. All browser teams have been invited to take a seat at the OWASP
European Summit, which will take place in Portugal in November.

The Summit will host the Intrinsic Security Working Group workshop on
Browser Security, to gather security experts and browser security
teams/developers together in order to facilitate introducing more and
more usable security into the browsers that all our customers use and
the specifications and standards that we rely on.

The Workshop on Browser Security aims to produce a browser security wish
list and a list of topics on HTML and browser security to be brought to
the World Wide Web Consortium.

\== The presentation ==

![Owasp_logo_normal.jpg](Owasp_logo_normal.jpg
"Owasp_logo_normal.jpg") This presentation describes the strengths and
benefits of combining code analysis with application penetration testing
during the assessment of the security of an application. It specifically
covers the following:

  - The strengths of manual code review in findings vulnerabilities
    (using the Top 10 as the categories)
  - The strengths of manual pen testing in findings vulnerabilities
    (against Top 10)
  - How each technique can leverage the other.
  - How proving a vulnerability can really be exploited can be
    important, but not really in a mature organization
  - The massive benefit of finding where the vulnerabilities are in the
    CODE, not just finding out how to exploit the application
  - How tracking down a penetration testing finding to where the flaw is
    in the actual code can be EXTREMELY hard

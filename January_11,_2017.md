  - Updating Membership Models: New plans created by staff based on past
    community, board and staff discussions. These proposed changes
    account for a more diverse membership and were developed to optimize
    accessibility and growth. Published to the community on January 6th.

    changes. \* This is operationally relevant as work is being done on

        plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19-RlgsiycSqJTTz8RNCsg30Vn0zAcRA-Y0pKvtOs7yo/edit)
  - PROPOSAL: An OWASP Foundation Board member is elected to a two-year
    term. A Board member may run again for re-election at any point in
    the future, but may serve no more than two two-year terms in any ten
    year period. Current Board members would be allowed to complete
    their current term. This would encourage new ideas and renewed
    energy on the OWASP Board of Directors and keep elections from being
    a popularity contest where incumbents may be difficult to displace.

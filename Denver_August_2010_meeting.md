### Clint Pollock: "Protecting Your Applications from Backdoors"

*How to Secure Your Business Critical Applications from Time Bombs,
Backdoors & Data*

With the increasing practice of outsourcing and using 3rd party
libraries, it is nearly impossible for an enterprise to identify the
pedigree and security of the software running its business critical
applications. As a result backdoors and malicious code are increasingly
becoming the prevalent attack vector used by hackers.

Whether you manage internal development activities, work with third
party developers or are developing a COTS application for enterprise,
your mandate is clear- safeguard your code and make applications
security a priority for internal and external development teams.

In this session we will cover;

  - Prevalence of backdoors and malicious code in third party attacks
  - Definitions and classifications of backdoors and their impact on
    your applications
  - Methods to identify, track and remediate these vulnerabilities

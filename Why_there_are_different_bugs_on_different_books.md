There are different bugs on different books as a result of Summer of
Code '08 project [OWASP Book Cover & Sleeve
Design](:Category:OWASP_Book_Cover_&_Sleeve_Design "wikilink").

![Asvs_bug.JPG](Asvs_bug.JPG "Asvs_bug.JPG") Alpha, Beta, and Release
drafts of a given book use different resolution images of the same bug.
Books can using this scheme be easily differentiated using consistent
visual cues, based on bug and bug resolution.

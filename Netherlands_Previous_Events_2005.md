## OWASP Netherlands kick-off meeting minutes

On 17 November, OWASP Netherlands had it's first meeting. We moved to a
bigger location, the Mercure hotel in Nieuwegein, to host all the 35
attendees.

The agenda:
18.00 - 18.30 Check-In (bread & drinks)
18.30 - 18.45 Chapter opening
18.45 - 19.30 Presentation - 'Top tien web applicatie kwetsbaarheden in
J2EE', Eelco Klaver
19.30 - 19.45 Presentation - 'Veilige webapplicaties boven alles', Mike
Wardi
19.45 - 20.00 Coffee break
20.00 - 21.00 Discussion - About the OWASP Netherlands local chapter

The discussion took place in a 'round table' session, where all
attendees were able to take part. The focus of the discussion was how to
give the OWASP Netherlands local chapter additional value, next to the
OWASP project. What the goals and tasks will be. And which actions will
have to be taken at short term.
Different people have interest in different subjects. In general
meetings there is no time to address all subjects and address them
specific enough. Therefore subgroups can be formed, focusing on specific
topics. They can have their own communication channel and meetings, but
should keep close contact with the OWASP body.

An inventarisation:

Discussion Topics
\- Awareness: writing articles, press publications, interviews
\- Education: contact universities, schools and their common boards.
Develop and gather education materials.
\- General: discuss ideas for OWASP NL

Focusgroup Topics
\- (dutch) metrics project
\- (dutch) legal project
\- standard framework for pentest reports
\- safe outsourcing

Actions that should be taken on short term are:
\- provide communication channels
\- plan next (sub)meetings
\- start discussions and focusgroups

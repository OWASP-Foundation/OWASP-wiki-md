<td><p><strong>OWASP Europe TOUR,</strong> is an event across the European region that promotes awareness about application security, so that people and organizations can make informed decisions about true application security risks. Everyone is free to participate in OWASP and all of our materials are available under a free and open software license.</p>
<ul>
<li>Apart from OWASP's Top 10, most OWASP Projects are not widely used and understood. In most cases this is not due to lack of quality and usefulness of those Document &amp; Tool projects, but due to a lack of understanding of where they fit in an Enterprise's security ecosystem or in the Web Application Development Life-cycle.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This event aims to change that by providing a selection of mature and enterprise ready projects together with practical examples of how to use them.</li>

align="center" colspan="0" | Following a systematic study of the costs
of cybercrime, in response to a request from the UK Ministry of Defence
following scepticism that previous studies had hyped the problem, each
of the main categories of cybercrime we set out what is and is not known
of the direct costs, indirect costs and defence costs { both to the UK
and to the world as a whole. We distinguish carefully between
traditional crimes that are now \`cyber' because they are conducted
online (such as tax and welfare fraud); transitional crimes whose modus
operandi has changed substantially as a result of the move online (such
as credit card fraud); new crimes that owe their existence to the
Internet; and what we might call platform crimes such as the provision
of botnets which facilitate other crimes rather than being used to
extract money from victims directly. |- | style="width:10%"

colspan="0" | DI Stewart Garrick has over 27 years experience in the
Metropolitan Police Service, 22 years as a detective and 10 years as a
Detective Inspector. His career has been spent primarily on major crime
units engaged on both proactive and reactive investigations, including 5
years investigating murders, 3 years on the Homicide Task Force (a
proactive unit targeting those who would commit murder) and 5 years
managing covert operations against organised crime. In March 2011 he
joined Scotland Yard's Police Central eCrime Unit. He has witnessed the
PCeU's growth from 40 officers to over 100 and has managed several high
profile investigations. He has recently taken charge of the unit's cadre
of police and civilian forensic examiners who are integrated into the
unit's dynamic investigative model. He has this year completed an MSc in
Countering Organised Crime and Terrorism at UCL, with a dissertation
examining the emergence of radicalising settings based on Situational
Action Theory. |- | style="width:10%" valign="middle" height="30"

align="center" colspan="0" | The OWASP Mobile Security Project is a
centralized resource intended to give developers and security teams the
resources they need to build and maintain secure mobile applications.
Through the project, our goal is to classify mobile security risks and
provide developmental controls to reduce their impact or likelihood of
exploitation.

As part of the overall Mobile Project , the Top 10 Mobile Risks include

M1: Insecure Data Storage M2: Weak Server Side Controls M3: Insufficient
Transport Layer Protection M4: Client Side Injection M5: Poor
Authorization and Authentication M6: Improper Session Handling M7:
Security Decisions Via Untrusted Inputs M8: Side Channel Data Leakage
M9: Broken Cryptography M10: Sensitive Information Disclosure |- |

also out actual approach to testing. This talk is sure to challenge the
status quo of web security today.

"Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different
results." - Albert Einstein

We continue to rely on a “pentest” to secure our applications. Why do we
think it is acceptable to perform a time-limited test of an application
to help ensure security when a determined attacker may spend 10-100
times longer attempting to find a suitable vulnerability? Our testing
methodologies are non-consistent and rely on the individual and the
tools they use. Currently we treat vulnerabilities like XSS and SQLI as
different issues but the root causes it the same. – it’s all code
injection theory\!\! Why do we do this and make security bugs over
complex?

Why are we still happy with “Testing security out” rather than the more
superior “building security in”? |- | style="width:10%" valign="middle"

Project Leader | style="width:40%" valign="middle" height="30"
bgcolor="\#EEEEEE" align="center" colspan="0" | Do you know your "A, B,
Cs" from your "1, 2, 3s"?

Is "red" much worse than "orange", and why is "yellow" used instead of
"green"?

Just what is a "critical" vulnerability? Is "critical" the same as "very
high"?

How do PCI DSS "level 4 and 5" security scanning vulnerabilities relate
to application weaknesses?

Does a "tick" mean you passed? Are you using CWE and CVSS? Is a "medium"
network vulnerability as dangerous as a "medium" application
vulnerability? Can CWSS help?

What is FIPS PUB 199? Does risk ranking equate to prioritisation? What
is "one" vulnerability?

Are you drowning in a mess of unrelated, classifications, terminology
and abbreviations? If you are a security verifier and want to know more
about ranking your findings more meaningfully, or receive test reports
and want to better understand the results, or are just new to ranking
weaknesses/vulnerabilities and want an overview, come along to this
presentation. It will also explain why the unranked information-only
("grey" or "blue"?) findings might contain some of the best value
information. |- | style="width:10%" valign="middle" height="30"

simple steps help. | style="width:25%" valign="middle" height="30"
bgcolor="\#EEEEEE" align="center" colspan="0" | Steven van der Baan -
OWASP Cambridge | style="width:40%" valign="middle" height="30"
bgcolor="\#EEEEEE" align="center" colspan="0" | Secure coding is often
perceived as difficult and complex. While it is true that 'good
security' should be embedded into the design, there are a couple of
steps a developer can take which lead to a more secure application. In
this presentation we will go to the basics of secure application
development and demonstrate these principles which help you build
security into your application. |- |}

"Owasp_logo_normal.jpg")In this talk Dinis Cruz will show the OWASP O2
Platform which is an open source toolkit specifically designed for
developers and security consultants to be able to perform quick,
effective and thorough 'source-code-driven' application security
reviews. The OWASP O2 Platform
(http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_O2_Platform) consumes results
from the scanning engines from Ounce Labs, Microsoft's CAT.NET tool,
FindBugs, CodeCrawler and AppScan DE, and also provides limited support
for Fortify and OWASP WebScarab dumps. In the past, there has been a
very healthy skepticism on the usability of Source Code analysis engines
to find commonly found vulnerablities in real world applications. This
presentation will show that with some creative and powerful tools, it IS
possible to use O2 to discover those issues. This presentation will also
show O2's advanced support for Struts and Spring MVC.

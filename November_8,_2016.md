Matt T., has been recruited, hired and empowered to drive the job
description that was
[written](https://www.owasp.org/images/a/a1/OWASP_Project_Coordinator-FabioTobiasAug25.pdf).
Good job to him and the staff for working together on key objectives.
Next is the website effort, budget was allocated and removed. This is a
issue and needs discussion of issue and solution. Invest in owasp and
budget appropriately as one does with a 2M business.

  - What does a future OWASP look like? Directional aspirations and
    impacts to type of ED \[Michael\]

Additional Notes to 150K Seed Fund:
We are gathering a team with ample experience in organizing owasp (and
other) events, including the last 2 owasp summits.
By focusing on the content and outcome objectives we are creating the
necessary momentum for this summit.
In parallel we are putting in motion the logistics for this summit
(venue, catering, sponsoring, ...)

We will definitely try to make this a "budget-neutral" event, by:
1\) having people cover their participation themselves
2\) having sponsors that cover part of the costs
3\) tapping into the under-used chapter and project funds
At this stage we want to be sure to have the support from the board &
staff and have a "seed-fund" of 150K USD.
I count on your (and the complete board) to support this new summit.

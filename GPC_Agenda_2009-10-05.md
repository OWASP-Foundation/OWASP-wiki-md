# Agenda

## From Previous Meeting/Follow up

  - New Assessment Criteria
      - [Pravir's assessment
        diagram](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:OWASP-Assessment_Diag_v2.png)
        - Note that this is not related to 'Project Releases' but to
        'Project Health'
          - We need to create a separate diagram to help our project
            leaders to understand the desired workflow for Releases
            (which go from Alpha, to Beta, to Stable)
      - Modification of Assessment Criteria v2 (ACv2)
          - Review of [email
            templates](https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/Doc?docid=0ATb3QwFMHCXrZGdubjI3ZHNfMGhuZmJxOXA3&hl=en)
            to reflect any changes from above.

  - ["OWASP Mini-Summit 2009"](:Summit_2009 "wikilink")/[:OWASP AppSec
    DC 2009](:OWASP_AppSec_DC_2009 "wikilink"):
      - [Brad's
        PPT](https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/present/edit?id=0Ae9M2vJFBkqfZGZjOGJoY3dfMmM3cHI0OGN6&hl=en).

-----

  - Honorary memberships to be given to "active" OWASP participants
    (chapter leader, project participants, etc.). Chapter and projects
    committees to submit proposal for persons to be given membership.
      - See the ["OWASP Projects
        Dashboard"](OWASP_Projects_Dashboard "wikilink") with all the
        OWASP Projects,
      - [Email/draft to be sent to all OWASP
        leaders](https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/Doc?id=dcn8962c_51ftpmj2g7).

-----

  - Spreading [OWASP Project Details
    Tab](:Template:OWASP_Project_Identification_Tab "wikilink") through
    ALL OWASP Projects.
      - ALL the projects with defined leadership already HAVE the GPC
        Project Details Tab - Check out ["OWASP Projects
        Dashboard"](OWASP_Project_Details_Table "wikilink"),
          - Methodology to fill in the referred tab?
          - Methodology to link the tab to each project?

-----

  - Consider having a single release roadmap page that is not attached
    to a single version but instead is the summation of the various
    release roadmaps.
      - The single page is easier for project leaders to find/edit
      - The single page would show the progression of the project to
        external audiences
      - Makes the release roadmap very similar to a changelog - which is
        more useful if its in one place rather then in bits attached to
        releases.

-----

  - Projects committee should determine which projects/project leaders
    are supported financially. Travel, evangelism, publication,
    training, etc.....
      - Matt Tesauro's draft to deal with this kind of issues.

-----

  - Committee members' evaluation process.
      - "GPC - Send 'Individual Committee Member' [online
        form](https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=ckdDbXE0bkxPM3dkbDZvSmFNWVBGcnc6MA)".

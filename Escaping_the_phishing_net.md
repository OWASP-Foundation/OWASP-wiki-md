**Abstract**: Phishing attacks have posed serious challenges by exposing
the technical deficiencies of internet technologies and its business
models. Phishing attacks are difficult to tackle because the problem
lies outside the scope of secure application development. Phishing
attacks don’t require a web application to be vulnerable as such. It
basically exploits the ignorance on part of the end user to carry out
successful exploits. End users don’t have a standard mechanism to verify
the authenticity of the server application, which is the fundamental
cause of phishing. Most of the solutions designed to counter phishing
attacks are not aimed at addressing this fundamental flaw and hence
those would fail to provide a fool proof solution even though they may
succeed in minimizing the number of successful attacks. In this paper I
shall explore various phishing attack techniques used by crackers, some
of the countermeasures proposed and implemented and their drawbacks. I
shall then suggest a new model that is aimed at curing the cause of
phishing attacks and not just its symptoms. I shall also take a look at
the usability issues that would result from the adoption of the new
model.

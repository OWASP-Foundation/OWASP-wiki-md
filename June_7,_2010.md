#### Proposal to operationalise OWASP ‘Chapter-lead’ Training activities and the concept of ‘OWASP Academies’

**Activities:**

  - Main focus on:
      - Normalization and ‘packaging’ of the OWASP ‘Chapter-lead’ events
        so that they can easily be executed by the local OWASP Chapters
          - Creation of the ‘OWASP Training Pack’ (book + pdf + dvd)
            with the materials developed by successful deliveries of
            OWASP ‘Chapter-lead’ events
      - Establishment of working relationships with ‘OWASP friendly’
        Universities:
          - starting with the OWASP Chapter-lead training courses, but
            with a view to evolve those courses into OWASP ‘Academies’
      - Negotiate potential sponsorship opportunities for the OWASP
        ‘Chapter-lead’ events
      - Logistical organization of OWASP ‘Chapter-lead’ training
        activities:
          - multiple individual OWASP ‘Chapter-lead’ training events
          - (try to) organize a ‘OWASP Tour’ of 20x training events in
            Oct/Nov 2010 (with US trainers)

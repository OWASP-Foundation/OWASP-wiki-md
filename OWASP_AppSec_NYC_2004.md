## Speaker Bios and Talk Summaries

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Denis Verdon</strong> - Head of CISG, Fidelity National Financial - Denis has 21 years experience in Information Security and IT in the Financial Services industry, much of which gained while working both as a senior security executive and as a consultant to senior security executives at Global 200 companies across 19 countries. Originally from a network design and engineering background, he has held senior positions at Price Waterhouse as European practice leader for Ethical Hacking, Ernst and Young International and as head of information security and risk management at Instinet. <a href="mailto:denis.verdon@fnf.com">denis.verdon@fnf.com</a></p>
<p><strong>Teaching Developers to Fish!</strong> - Application security - From requirements definition to operations and maintenance - needs not only policy, good practices and coding standards; it needs an adaptable application security framework and methodology, coupled with culture change and education of the development community. The presentation will share real-world experiences in developing and implementing a methodology, focusing on the challenges of applying risk assessment data to application design, dealing with differing development methodologies and educating developers about the correct application of security technology. It will give a status report on this effort within FNF, from the context of a company that has grown its application development capability through acquisition of multiple software development shops.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Curphey</strong> - Mark has a Masters Degree in Information Security from <a href="http://isg.rhul.ac.uk/">Royal Holloway, University of London</a>. He works for <a href="http://www.foundstone.com/">Foundstone</a> as a consulting Director specializing in strategic application security work and was previously a Director for Information Security at <a href="http://www.schab.com/">Charles Schwab</a> in San Francisco and ran the consulting teams on the East Coast out of Atlanta. He has held various positions with international investment banks in Europe and North America. In his spare time he enjoys his family (wife Cara, Son Jack (aged 3 years) and daughter Hana (aged 10 months)) and driving fast cars. <a href="mailto:mark@curphey.com">mark@curphey.com</a></p>
<p><strong>OWASP Projects - Testing Guide/SDLC</strong> - For a long time we have known that the root cause of the application security problem is insecure software. While some people try to find new ways to break software, others are focusing their attention on solving the root cause and building more secure software. This speech will cover how to build an enterprise testing program that centers around continuous improvement of the software development lifecycle to improve the security quality of software development.</p>
<p><strong>OASIS WAS-XML</strong> - The OASIS WAS technical committee are developing an XML format to describe application security vulnerabilities. OASIS WAS however has far reaching uses beyond simply vulnerability identification including metrics and measurement and risk management. This speech will provide an overview of OASIS WAS and discuss the creative ways people are using the format.</p>
<p><strong>Jack Danahy</strong> - Jack is President and CEO of Ounce Labs, innovator of application risk management solutions, based in Waltham, MA. A frequent speaker and writer on the need for application security metrics and a contributor to policy forums and standards organizations, Jack holds patents or has patents pending in kernel security, secure remote communications, systems' management and distributed computing. <a href="mailto:jack.danahy@ouncelabs.com">jack.danahy@ouncelabs.com</a></p>
<p><strong>Security in Numbers: The Need For Metrics in Security Decisions</strong> - Good security decisions rely on accurate information. Without knowing the greatest areas of risk, security technology decisions are made based on 'best guess' analysis. At best, this results in an inefficient approach to security. At worst, it is an ineffective one. This presentation will discuss the importance of gathering application security metrics and how to use that information to make targeted, deliberate decisions about how and where to spend security budgets and set a road map towards more effective security.</p>
<p><strong>Stan Guzik</strong> - Stan, CISSP, MCP is the CTO for Immediatech Corp. His primary focus is on developing secure Internet based document management technologies targeting the financial markets. His areas of expertise include information security, information systems, SDLC, document management, and workflow. Previously Stan has held senior web application architecture positions for consulting companies specializing in web application development. In addition to holding a number of industry related certificates Stan also holds a Masters of Science in Information Systems from <a href="http://www.stevens.edu/">Stevens Institute of Technology</a>. <a href="mailto:sguzik@immediatech.com">sguzik@immediatech.com</a></p>
<p><strong>OWASP Projects - ISO7799</strong> - The number of threats against Web Applications is constantly increasing. Threats posed by viruses, hackers, and employees are increasing in complexity and require a comprehensive long-term information security management strategy. We will discuss how we can apply ISO 17799 to reduce these threats as a security management strategy for Web Applications.</p>
<p><strong>Bruce Mayhew</strong> - Bruce leads the development of the WebGoat project for OWASP. Bruce works at Aspect Security, Inc. as a Java software architect and security analyst. <a href="mailto:bruce.mayhew@aspectsecurity.com">bruce.mayhew@aspectsecurity.com</a></p>
<p><strong>OWASP Projects</strong> - WebGoat - WebGoat is a J2EE web application designed to demonstrate and teach about common web application security vulnerabilities. Bruce will discuss the WebGoat project and plans for the future. The talk will cover the use of WebGoat in the corporate environment for both developers and security professionals. You'll also see demonstrations of the WebGoat approach to learning.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Williams</strong> - Jeff heads up the Top Ten project for OWASP and designed the original WebGoat architecture. Jeff is the founder and CEO of <a href="http://www.aspectsecurity.com">Aspect Security</a>, Inc., an application security consulting company providing security code review, penetration testing, secure development training, and security engineering services. Jeff is an expert in computer security, an avid mountain biker, a lawyer, boomerang designer, and a firm believer in strong AI. <a href="mailto:jeff.williams@aspectsecurity.com">jeff.williams@aspectsecurity.com</a></p>
<p><strong>Input validation where and how?</strong> - Input validation is absolutely critical, yet it is the most often forgotten security mechanism. Most projects leave validation to the developers and the results are generally very spotty. Jeff will discuss why input validation is so important, architectural options for performing validation, and the key considerations for successfully implementing validation in your web application.</p>
<p><strong>Dave Aitel</strong> - Dave is the Founder of Immunity, Inc., and a leading researcher in the field of application security. His previous talks have been well received at conferences such as BlackHat, G-Con, and Pacsec. His experience includes time at both leading private information security companies, and the National Security Agency. <a href="mailto:jdave@immunitysec.com">jdave@immunitysec.com</a></p>
<p><strong>Beyond Best Practices</strong> - Customized Application Security Too often CISO's and application architects are in catch-up mode when it comes to application security. Consulting teams are brought in and demonstrate SQL Injection for the umpteenth time to your development team, or a cross site scripting bug is found on the main web page by a customer and brought to your attention as a "fix right now". Dave Aitel's talk will highlight where and when best practices, even rigorously applied, for application security can fail to address the underlying problem, and present examples of technological measures that can be taken to provide real and obvious security benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Combs</strong> - Jeff is a Senior Recruiter with Alta Associates. Since joining Alta in 1999 Jeff has been recruiting Information Security professionals for corporate clients, professional services firms and security product vendors. He is sought after for his understanding of industry dynamics, hiring trends, professional development strategies and access to market intelligence.

<p><strong>Security Considerations in the System Development Life Cycle of Web Services-based Systems - Toto, We're Not in Kansas Any More . . .</strong> - Web services introduce a major paradigm shift which violates most, if not all, of the tacit security assumptions made by the systems with which they interact. In addition, the scope of the threats to which Web services-based systems are vulnerable is much broader than that of any systems that have been implemented to this point. It is crucial that everyone involved with Web services-based systems understand the scope of this shift because it affects all phases of the SDLC. In this session, we will begin to outline the implications of this paradigm shift using NIST Special Publication 800-64 as the framework for discussing the security considerations in the system development life cycle of Web services-based systems.</p></td>

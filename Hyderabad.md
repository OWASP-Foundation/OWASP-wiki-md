**Agenda:**

**1) All about Java Deserialization Vulnerability**

Java Deserialization of untrusted data has been a security buzzword for
the past couple of years with almost every application using native Java
serialization framework being vulnerable to Java deserialization
attacks. Since it's inception, there have been many scattered attempts
to come up with a solution to best address this flaw. In this talk we
will focus on Java deserialization vulnerability and mitigation
framework provided by Oracle in its latest JDK.

**About Speakers:** Venkata Suresh Sanga is a Principle Security
Engineer in Oracle having more than 13+ years of experience in
Application Development and Security. Currently working on SAST Tools to
remediate or mitigate the Application Vulnerabilities. He has Masters in

**Event Start Time:** Saturday, 10th Mar, 2018 at 10:00 AM (IST)

**Agenda:**

**1) Does your Pentesting cover all the basis of IT Security ?**

This talk focuses on how to align the security validation of a web
application with the three basic elements of security
namely,Confidentiality,Integrity, and Availability (CIA). The test
effectiveness can be achieved by analyzing the requirements of each
element and identifying the potential breaches that can compromise each
element. The efficiency should be built by relating these breaches with
the known OWASP Top 10 and other vulnerabilities and, leveraging that
knowledge to identify the testing approach - static and dynamic
throughout the SDLC.

**About Speakers:**

**Bhushan Gupta** has over 30 years of experience in software
engineering, 23 of which have been in the software industry. Although
recognized for his contributions in the areas of software engineering
such as agile processes and quality methods and metrics, Bhushan has

## OWASP Newsletter \#6 (6-Mar-2007)

Welcome to the 6th OWASP Newsletter, again filled with the latest OWASP
and Web Application Security updates.

If you have any content to add to the next edition, feel free to add it
directly to its WIKI page ([OWASP Newsletter

As Dinis is very busy this week, I helped him out with this Newsletter.

## Featured Item: OWASP Autumn of Code 2006 finished\!

All the OWASP Autumn of Code 2006 projects are completed.
Congratulations to all contributors and project leaders\!

  - [WebScarab
    NG](OWASP_Autumn_of_Code_2006_-_Projects:_WebScarab_NG "wikilink"):
    A working beta version is now available for WebScaraB which
    implements a complete new user interface and is much more usable and
    practical (although still doesn't have all features from the current
    version)
  - [Live CD](OWASP_Autumn_of_Code_2006_-_Projects:_Live_CD "wikilink"):
    The Live CD is a valuable addition to the OWASP collection, since it
    allows the easy access, use and testing of several OWASP tools and
    documents
  - [CAL9000](OWASP_Autumn_of_Code_2006_-_Projects:_CAL9000 "wikilink"):
    A new version of CAP 9000 is now released containing several new
    features and with extended support for more browsers
  - [SiteGenerator and
    ORG](OWASP_Autumn_of_Code_2006_-_Projects:_SiteGenerator_and_ORG "wikilink")
    :Both [OWASP Report
    Generator](OWASP_Report_Generator "wikilink")(ORG) and [OWASP Site
    Generator](OWASP_Site_Generator "wikilink") (OSG) receive large
    number of enhancements. In ORG tons of small/medium bugs were fixed
    and several new major features where added (in addition to an update
    to .NET 2.0). In OSG, HttpModule was re-implemented to use TCP,
    several nasty bugs were fixed and new OSG vulnerabilities where
    added.
  - [Pantera](OWASP_Autumn_of_Code_2006_-_Projects:_Pantera "wikilink"):
    Simon delivered a new version of Pantera which contains several new
    features and is more optimized
  - [Web
    Goat](OWASP_Autumn_of_Code_2006_-_Projects:_Web_Goat "wikilink"): 12
    new lessons where added to WebGoat (for example: DOM/XML Injection,
    JSON Injection, Cross-Site Request Forgery , HTTP Splitting, etc..)
  - [Testing
    Guide](OWASP_Autumn_of_Code_2006_-_Projects:_Testing_Guide "wikilink"):The
    previous Guide was greatly enhanced where large portions were
    re-writen and new material added. This Guide is an important
    addition to the OWASP catalogue.
  - [Owasp .Net
    Tools](OWASP_Autumn_of_Code_2006_-_Projects:_Owasp_.Net_Tools "wikilink"):
    The OWASP .Net tools SAM'SHE and ANSA are in integrated into a new
    client server architecture which contains a 'built from scratch'
    client application which 'consumes' the results from the .Net tests.
    This new tools (called OWASP Tiger) could be the beginning of a
    standard vulnerability collector.
  - [Owasp
    Website](OWASP_Autumn_of_Code_2006_-_Projects:_Website_and_Branding "wikilink"):
    Multiple sections of OWASP.org website where re-organized (for
    example the Projects Page), the OWASP newsletter was created and
    several pages received improvements in their layout

More details on [OWASP Autumn Of
Code 2006](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Autumn_Of_Code_2006). We
are also just about to lauch the "SpoC 007" (do you get the joke?),
which is the OWASP Spring of Code 2007.

## Featured Project: XML Gateway Eval Project

This [OWASP
Project](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_XML_Security_Gateway_Evaluation_Criteria_Project)
defines an open standard for evaluating XML Security Gateways. This
criteria will provide the OWASP community a set of standard evaluation
criteria to assess the functionality and quality of XML Security
Gateways. The main driver for this project is to reduce the confusion
and complexity in assessing the strengths and weaknesses of solutions in
this the XML Security space, and enlightening the community as to the
utility of XML Security Gateways to deliver a number of valuable
security services.

## Latest additions to the WIKI

The [OWASP Blogs](http://blogs.owasp.org/) have been integrated in the

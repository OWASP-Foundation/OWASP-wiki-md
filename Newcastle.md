# Upcoming Events

We're back with our first event of 2019\! We'll be hosting 2 great talks
in our usual talk-pizza-talk fashion. The room is CCE01-403 (4th floor)
which is in the Law building of Northumbria University.

Register via Eventbrite
[here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-newcastle-feb-2019-meetup-tickets-55154075324).

**Talk 1: Matt Wixey (@darkartlab)**

The talk will be three smaller talks, covering: 

1.  Remote online social engineering (how attackers use catfishing
    techniques) 
2.  Hacking with light and sound (using infrared, ultrasound, and lasers
    to exfiltrate data and disrupt sensors) 
3.  Attack linkage (using granular attack behaviours to link different
    cyber attacks)

**Talk 2: Kathryn Cardose (@AGeordieLass)**

"Getting stakeholders on board".

  - So you’ve nailed the tech, you’ve found the controls, you’ve
    requested remediation.....how do you get stakeholders of all levels
    to buy in and support security?

# Past Events

**2018 Dates** ----25/09/2018 from 18:00 to 21:00 at Northumbria
University, City Campus East, room CCE1-402.

Speakers:

  - **Andy Ferguson: "Don't tell your Big Brother" Encryption tips and
    tricks.**
  - **Gavin Johnson-Lynn: My Path to CSSLP.** Join me on a journey from
    a vague knowledge of security to gaining a valued security
    certification. For anyone considering certification as a route to
    success, self-improvement, or even just some thoughts on how I
    approached it. We’ll look at what I learned and how I learned it,
    including some tricks I picked up along the way to help cram
    information into my brain (and keep it there).

The event is detailed here:
<https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-newcastle-september-2018-meetup-tickets-49842084015>
----26/06/2018 from 18:00 to 21:00 at Northumbria University, City
Campus East, room CCE1-402. We held our first CTF (Capture The Flag)
event.

----27/03/2018 from 18:00 to 21:00 at Northumbria University, City
Campus East, room CCE1-402.

Speakers

  - **Andi Pannell: The Internet of (broken) things.** This talk will
    focus on the internet of things, how we’re connecting everything to
    the internet now, because why not add a WiFi connection to your
    Fridge? And how security is unlikely to be a consideration when
    making these products. I’ll also talk about DefCon, as last year my
    company sent a team of us to DefCon 25 in Las Vegas, explaining what
    DefCon is, what happens there, and how we won the IoT Village 0-day
    contest and I'll conclude with a **live hacking demo**.
  - **Colin Watson: An introduction to the OWASP automated threats to
    web applications.** Web applications are subjected to unwanted
    automated usage – day in, day out. The vast majority of these events
    relate to misuse of inherent valid functionality, rather than the
    attempted exploitation of unmitigated vulnerabilities. Also,
    excessive misuse is often mistakenly reported as application
    denial-of-service (DoS) like HTTP-flooding, when in fact the DoS is
    a side-effect instead of the attacker’s primary intent. [Project

\----**2017 Dates**

-----

21/11/2017 from 18:00 to 21:00 at Northumbria University, City Campus
East, room CCE1-024.

Speakers:

  - **Lorenzo Grespan: Explain hacking in ten minutes.** Bio: Lorenzo
    Grespan is a computer scientist currently working as an application
    security specialist for Secarma, Ltd. While his main interest has
    always been computer security, he also worked as a developer,
    systems administrator and project manager for a research effort in
    robotic surgery. His background is in computational neuroscience,
    neural networks and evolutionary systems and he likes to solve
    interesting problems at the intersection of people and technology.
    Talk (30 minutes): Recently I had to show a 10-minute  "live hack"
    to a non-technical audience. As an introvert and a geek my main
    effort was in maintaining technical accuracy, however what made the
    audience go "aha\!" turned out to be what for me was the least
    significant detail of the entire demo. In this talk I will show the
    hack, share the lessons learned and discuss how to communicate
    security concerns to non technical stakeholders, higher management
    and end users. [Media:OWASPNCL LG

  - **Robin Sillem:** **Building a Development Environment That's
    'Secure Enough'.** This will be a discussion of how a team at DWP is
    using modern DevOps practices to create a dev/build/test platform
    secure enough for development of services handling large volumes of
    UK citizen data.

19/09/2017 from 18:00 to 21:00 at Northumbria University, City Campus
East, room CCE1-024.

Speakers:

  - **Gareth Dixon: Running a security event using OWASP Security
    Shepherd.** In this talk I will cover running a security event using
    [OWASP Security Shepherd](OWASP_Security_Shepherd "wikilink"). The
    event to be discussed was staged to promote engagement in a security
    initiative, understanding of security vulnerabilities and the
    application of knowledge to production services and applications.
    This talk will cover the project planning stage, through execution
    to the project retrospective.
    [Media:Security_Shepherd.pptx](Media:Security_Shepherd.pptx "wikilink")
  - **Mike Goodwin: Enter the (Threat ) Dragon:Threat Modeling with
    OWASP Threat Dragon**. Threat modelling is a great technique for
    hardening your application designs, but current tooling is a bit
    "crashy", limited to Windows or not free. [OWASP Threat
    Dragon](OWASP_Threat_Dragon "wikilink") is an OWASP incubator
    project that aims to fix this and bring threat modeling to the
    masses. This talk is a tour round the tool, it's future road map and
    a look under it's hood. Mike the the project leader for Threat
    Dragon, so if you want to contribute, he would be very pleased to
    speak to you.

**2016 Dates**

-----

23/08/2016 from 18:00 to 21:00 at The Auditorium - Bunker Coffee and
Kitchen 9-11 Carliol Square, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, NE1 6UF.

Speakers:

  - **Andrew Pannell: 50 Million Downloads and All I Got Was Malware.**
    How is it a free Android application that has been downloaded more
    times than WhatsApp can turn your phone into malware, sending your
    private data to China and inserting adverts? I’ll be discussing my
    journey of researching mobile malware and how you can too.
    [1](https://www.droidandy.com/uploads/50MillionDownloads.pdf)
  - **Colin Watson: OWASP Cornucopia.** OWASP Cornucopia is a free
    open-source card game, referenced by a PCI DSS information
    supplement, that helps derive application security requirements
    during the software development life cycle. This session will use an
    example eCommerce application to demonstrate how to utilise the card
    game. After an introduction and explanation, we will split into
    smaller groups to play the game gaining insights into relevant web
    application threats. The game is best played in groups of 4-6 with
    people who have a good knowledge of the application being assessed,
    and who have a mixture of backgrounds/experience - architects,
    developers, product owners, project managers, testers, etc, and
    those with software security responsibilities. Bring your colleagues
    along. Cornucopia is suitable for people aged 10 to 110 (decimal).

**2015 Dates**

-----

24/11/2015 from 18:00 to 21:00 at Northumbria University Ellison
Building EBA002

Speakers:

  - **Ben Lee** and **Ross Dargan**: **The problems with proving
    identity.** In this talk Ross (@rossdargan) and Ben (@bibbleq) will
    discuss the conundrum of proving (and more importantly verifying\!)
    identity online. While both of these tasks might seem simple at
    first, they really aren't. This is a problem that people have
    grappled with since the beginning of communications (okay so not the
    online part\!) and we still don't have all the answers. The talk
    will cover among other things; Twitter, wax seals (\!), hashing,
    certificates and much more…\* (\*Talk may not be historically
    accurate\! ;)) [Media:
    OWASPNewcastle_the_problem_with_proving_identity.pptx](Media:_OWASPNewcastle_the_problem_with_proving_identity.pptx "wikilink")
  - **Colin Watson - Think about the Top 10 Controls, not the Top 10
    Risks.** The OWASP Top 10 is the most well-known OWASP project, but
    how can awareness of OWASP guidance for developers be improved? In
    this presentation Colin Watson will describe a board game that
    encourages developers to think and learn about the most important
    web application security controls, rather than risks or
    vulnerabilities. Take a copy of the game away with you - it is
    suitable for developers of all sizes. [Media:
    Owaspnewcastle-snakesandladders.pptx](Media:_Owaspnewcastle-snakesandladders.pptx "wikilink")
  - **Michael Haselhurst - Automated Security Testing Using The ZAP
    API.** This talk will show you how to integrate the OWASP ZAP API
    with automated test scripts using Sahi. [Media:
    OWASPNewcastle_automated_security_testing_using_ZAP_API.pptx](Media:_OWASPNewcastle_automated_security_testing_using_ZAP_API.pptx "wikilink")
  - **Mike Goodwin - Real world defence in depth (part 1).** Everyone
    should be aiming for defence in depth, but what does it actually
    mean to an application developer? This is the first of a series of
    short talks about real world scenarios where defence in depth is
    genuinely useful and easily achievable. It should help you turn
    defence in depth from an aspiration into practical reality. [Media:

Speakers:

  - **Neil Dixley: Cognitive Bias and Security Vulnerabilities: The
    psychology of software engineering.** An introduction to the
    psychology of cognitive bias and how human nature and cognitive
    biases are the key to user based security vulnerabilities. A look at
    how our brains trick us into feeling safe while giving our pin
    number to strangers on the phone plus a look at how we can use
    technology to disrupt cognitive bias and use these human traits to
    mitigate threats and strengthen application security.
    [Media:Cognitive_Bias_and_Security_Vulnerabilities__Presentation.pptx](Media:Cognitive_Bias_and_Security_Vulnerabilities_Presentation.pptx "wikilink")
  - **Andy Ward: Security Compliance for Developers - Are we
    Certified... or Certifiable?.** Against a background of increasing
    threats and hacks, with more and more of our personal lives and
    business processes conducted online, it's never been more important
    to ensure our software is secure and robust. But how do you prove
    it? These days, reassuring your customers takes more than an SSL
    padlock, and some marketing spiel mentioning 'banking grade
    encryption'\! After a quick reminder of "what's the worst that can
    happen...", Andy will introduce some of the security Compliance and
    Certification systems that help you 'walk the walk', and provide
    confidence that your system has its security in good hands, before
    looking at what it means for developers and engineering teams.

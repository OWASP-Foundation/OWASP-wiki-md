Recently, information has been brought to our attention which allows the
current OWASP Board to revisit OWASPâ€™s position on the Google Hacking
Inquiry that was undertaken in July of 2010. The [OWASP Code of
Ethics](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/About_The_Open_Web_Application_Security_Project#Code_of_Ethics)
states that we should not intentionally injure or impugn the
professional reputation of colleagues and, upon consideration, we feel
that perpetuating the inquiry results would do just that. As such, we
feel that it is in the best interests of the OWASP Foundation and all
concerned parties to wipe the slate clean by removing the details of the
inquiry from our public records at this time. We feel sincerely sorry
for any damages that this inquiry may have caused to any of the parties
involved.

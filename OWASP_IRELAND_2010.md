Welcome to the Irish OWASP Application Security Conference\!
On **September 17th, 2010** OWASP held its second Irish Application
Security conference in Dublin University, Trinity College, Dublin,
Ireland.

#### About

The conference consisted of an intensive day of talks/presentations and
discussion with 2 different tracks focusing on the causes and trends in
web application insecurity.
Finally six months of work by the OWASP Ireland chapter board paid
off:
Many thanks :
\- To every one who attended, helped out, presented, ran about.
\- To Samy Kamkar who came over to enlighten us all about how he'll meet
your girlfriend.......
\- To John Viega, Fred Piper and Damian Gordon for their keynotes, they
were great and provoked much discussion.
\- To all our local and international speakers who took time (and
expense) to come over and present...
\- Also thanks to our sponsors for all assistance.
Colin Watson who attended covered the event very nicely here:

#### Training

We intend to hold some application security training on the 16/09/2010
the day prior to the event.
This can be booked when booking a ticket to the event.

## **Secure Application Development: Writing secure code (and testing it)**

**Trainers**:

[**Eoin Keary** ](User:EoinKeary "wikilink") Senior Manager, Ernst &
Young, OWASP Board Member

**Rahim Jina** Senior Consultant, Ernst & Young, OWASP Ireland chapter
board.


**Abstract**
Writing Secure code is the most effective method to securing your web
applications. Writing secure code takes skill and know-how but results
in a more stable and robust application and assists in protecting an
organisations brand.

Application security is not commonly a part of many computer science
curricula today and most organizations have not focused on instituting a
culture that includes application security as a core part of their
software development training efforts. This intensive one-day course
focuses on the most common web application security problems, including
aspects of both the OWASP Top Ten (2010) and the MITRE Top 25.  The
course will introduce and demonstrate application assessment techniques,
illustrating how application vulnerabilities can be exploited so
students really understand how to avoid introducing such vulnerabilities
in their code.

This course includes coverage of the following areas:

  - Unvalidated Input
  - Injection Flaws
  - Cross-Site Scriping
  - CSRF
  - Authentication & Session Management
  - Access control & Authorisation
  - Broken Caching
  - Error Handling \&Resource Management
  - Cryptography
  - Rich Internet Applications
  - The Secure SDLC


**Hands on**

To cement the principles discussed, students can participate in a number
of hands-on security testing exercises where they attack a live web
application (i.e., WebGoat etc) that has been seeded with common web
application vulnerabilities. The students will use proxy tools commonly
used by the hacker community to complete the exercises. Students need to
bring their own windows based laptop to participate in the exercises.

**Audience**

Developers who want to understand the most common web application
security flaws, and how to avoid them and code in a secure manner

**Level**

Intermediate

**Prerequisite**

Basic knowledge of a web programming language like Java or .NET
recommended but not required.
Bringing your own windows based laptop is recommended so you can
participate in the hands on exercises.

**Duration**

Full day - 8 Hours

## Delaware Chapter Survey

Do you want to attend local chapter meetings? Thinking about it? Then
let your voice be heard by filling out our survey here:
<http://bit.ly/owaspDEpoll>
This will help us figure out what topics to cover, when to meet, where
to meet, etc.

## OWASP Delaware

Welcome to the official OWASP Delaware chapter homepage.
<b>[Click here](http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-Delaware)
to join the local chapter mailing list or browse the archives. </b>
It is a low volume mailing list, and the easiest way to stay informed.
![<File:Meetup-logo-2x.png>](Meetup-logo-2x.png
"File:Meetup-logo-2x.png") Our chapter has a Meetup.com page at
<http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Delaware-Chapter/>.
The short link is <http://bit.ly/owaspDE>.
If the meeting advertises food then be sure to **RSVP for meetings** at
the Meetup page so we can plan enough [food](food "wikilink").
If you don't RSVP you might go hungry. You've been warned.
The chapter leader is [David Rhoades](mailto:David.Rhoades@owasp.org).
Contact him if you have questions or want to get involved.

## Local Security Event - November 2015

Be sure to check out Security BSides Delaware 2015 at Wilmington
University in New Castle Delaware this November 13 through 14, 2015.
They will have a Capture the Flag (CTF) event too. There are bound to be
some web apps to hack at that event.

Check here for more info: <http://www.bsidesdelaware.com/>

## Meetings


Always check our Meetup page
(http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Delaware-Chapter/) for the most current
details

**NOTE:** We are aiming for *the first Tuesday of the month* moving
forward in 2015. However, that does not always work out. The location is
likely to be mostly New Castle, DE at Wilmington University.
**Next Meeting**

**When:** Tuesday, July 7, 2015. From 6:00 PM to \~ 7:30 PM.
**Location and RSVP:**
<http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Delaware-Chapter/events/222983336/>


**Agenda:** Node.js Security
See <http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Delaware-Chapter/events/222983336/> for
details - sorry but keeping both sites up-to-date is annoying and seems
unnecessary.
If using Meetup exclusively for your chapter is good enough for NYC
chapter, then it should be good enough for DE chapter. :-)

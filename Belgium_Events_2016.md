The agenda:

  - 18h15 - 19h00: **Welcome & sandwiches**
  - 19h00 - 19h10: '''[OWASP
    Update](https://www.owasp.org/images/1/1c/Owasp_Belgium_update_2016-10-18_v1.pptx)
    '''
  - 19h15 - 19h45: **[Find and fix software security problems… wait, do
    not make security mistakes in the first
    place\!](https://www.owasp.org/images/7/73/Presentation_Sensei_Security_v17_for_distribution.pdf)**
    (by Matias Madou)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *Abstract:* Today, companies do not have a shortage of known
    security problems in their solutions. Tools and people point out
    numerous software security problems that eventually should be fixed.
    So how do organizations deal with all these issues? What is the most
    effective way to get issues fixed? For companies taking security
    serious, the question is no longer “How many problems can you
    find?”, but the real question is “How many security issues can you
    fix or prevent developers from making?” In this session, we explore
    different routes on how to find and fix security issues, or prevent
    making them in the first place.
    *Bio:* Matias is the founder of Sensei Security, a software security
    startup building solutions to effectively fix and prevent security
    problems in software. Matias has over a decade of hands-on software
    security experience ranging from the research to improve existing
    solutions to scoping and building new solutions. A dozen patents and
    a bunch of papers are the result of his research that eventually led
    to a hand full of commercial products.

  - 19h45 - 19h55: **Break**
  - 19h55 - 20h30: **[Exploit mitigation using Multi-Variant
    Execution](https://www.owasp.org/images/b/b8/OWASP_MVEE.pptx)** (by
    Stijn Volckaert)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *Abstract:* Software we rely on every day is riddled with security
    vulnerabilities that can be exploited to crash, extract data, or
    seize control of computer systems. Current exploit mitigations do
    not seem to suffice to remedy this situation because hackers can
    circumvent them with relative ease. In this talk, I will present
    GHUMVEE, a state-of-the-art Multi-Variant Execution framework that
    was developed at Ghent University. GHUMVEE can amplify the
    effectiveness of other exploit mitigations and enable them to detect
    and block zero-day attacks. The idea is to create multiple
    diversified replicas of a vulnerable program and to execute these
    replicas in parallel on the same inputs while simultaneously
    monitoring their behavior. The program replicas are functionally
    equivalent under normal circumstances but behave differently when
    attacked. GHUMVEE detects this behavioral difference using a
    monitor. In the talk, I will discuss GHUMVEE’s design and
    implementation, as well as some of the follow-up research sponsored
    by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in the USA.
    *Bio:* Stijn is a Postdoctoral Scholar in Prof. Michael Franz’
    research group at the University of California, Irvine. He received
    his Ph.D. from Ghent University in 2015, under the supervision of
    Prof. Bjorn De Sutter and Prof. Koen De Bosschere. His research
    interests include systems security, reliability, and compilation. He
    is the recipient of the 2016 IBM Innovation Award (awarded by the
    F.W.O) for his PhD thesis on the topic of Multi-Variant Execution.

  - 20h40 - 21h15: **[ASPIRE: Advanced Software Protection: Integration,
    Research, and
    Exploitation](https://www.owasp.org/images/d/de/OWASP-ASPIRE.pdf)**
    (by Bjorn De Sutter)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *Abstract:* ASPIRE is a three year European FP7 research project on
    software protection to mitigate Man-at-the-End attacks on native
    code libraries on mobile systems. Together with Nagravision,
    Gemalto, and SafeNet, world leaders in their respective security
    markets, four academic institutes aim for developing layered, but
    software-only protection techniques that can protect the assets
    embedded in mobile apps of content, software and service providers
    as well as can be achieved with custom hardware-based protections
    such as smart cards and dongles. The project also aims for
    developing a quantitative evaluation methodology to assess the value
    of combinations of protections, and decision support to aid users of
    the ASPIRE protection framework. ASPIRE ends in October 2016, so
    this talk will present a preview off the final project results.
    *Bio:* Since 2008, Bjorn is a professor in the Computer Systems Lab
    at Ghent University. His research topics include compiler
    technologies and software protection, incl. binary rewriting
    techniques for a wide range of applications such as fault-injection
    mitigation, side-channel leakage mitigation, anti-reverse engineer,
    anti-tampering, and anti-debugging. He coordinates the ASPIRE
    project.

  - 19h15 - 20h00: **[CloudPiercer: Bypassing Cloud-based Security
    Providers](https://www.owasp.org/images/0/0e/CloudPiercerOwasp_20160908.pdf)**
    (by Thomas Vissers, iMinds-DistriNet-KU Leuven)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *Abstract:* Many website owners turn to Cloud-based Security
    Providers (CBSPs) to protect their websites from DDoS and web
    application attacks. Some of these security services rely solely on
    changing the DNS settings of a customer’s domain name to reroute his
    traffic through the CBSP's cloud infrastructure. This allows for
    complete circumvention of the security service by directly attacking
    the website’s hosting IP address. Therefore, it is crucial that a
    web server's hosting IP address remains hidden from potential
    attackers. Despite this risk, our study has shown that, in practice,
    over 70% of CBSP-protected domains are exposing their real IP
    address. In this talk, we will discuss several significant attack
    vectors and steps administrators can take to prevent their IP
    address from being discovered by attackers.
    *Bio:* **Thomas Vissers** Thomas Vissers is a PhD Researcher at
    iMinds-Distrinet, KU Leuven. His research is broadly focused on
    internet security and privacy topics, such as cloud-based security,
    domain name abuse, denial-of-service attacks, email security and
    browser fingerprinting. Furthermore, he has a special interest in
    machine learning, data mining and large-scale analyses. Thomas has
    published and presented his research at various international
    conferences, such as CCS, NDSS and HotPETS. He obtained his Master’s
    degree in Engineering from the University of Antwerp and was a
    research intern at Anna University, India.

  - 20h15 - 21h15: **[Hackers\! Do we shoot or do we
    hug?](https://www.owasp.org/images/5/58/Owasp_Hackers_Do_we_shoot_or_do_we_hug.pdf)**
    (by Edwin van Andel, Zerocopter)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *Abstract:* In the ever changing security landscape we are slowly
    seeing a shift from labeling hackers per default as 'bad and
    malicious individuals', to accepting them slowly as 'useful and
    potentially friendly’. We see more and more compagnies starting a
    bug bounty program and/or a Responsible Disclosure (Coordinated
    vulnerability disclosure) program.
    We in te Netherlands are (at least in Europe) leading the pack on
    this last subject, also backed heavily by the Dutch NCSC, the Dutch
    government and the Dutch prosecution services with their Responsible
    Disclosure guideline .
    In this interactive and mostly humorous talk I’ll start with
    defining security (in a grotesk way), followed bij the definition of
    hackers, the way hackers think and work, and how they can be used
    instead of feared by compagnies. I’ll show how bug bounties and the
    Responsible Disclosure processes work, or how they sometimes do not.
    I will also take the audience with me on some examples on how and
    why some websites fail in being secure, and the development errors
    behind those fails.
    During the talk I interact a lot with the audience, do quiz
    questions about the subject, and reward good answers with a bottle
    of club-mate. At the end of the talk the combined audience consensus
    should of course be to hug the hackers\!
    *Bio:* **Edwin van Andel** , better known as @Yafsec, joined
    Zerocopter, where he's mostly working on publicly expanding their
    “continuous security” platform. Elected winner of the Lightning
    talks at BruCON 2013, and organizer of the alternative NCSC
    conference "because no hackers were invited" \#ALT-S, he is now a
    renown speaker that will introduce you -in a humorous way- to the
    dangers, virtues and current state of affairs in the security
    landscape.

  - 19h10 - 20h00: **All Your Biases Belong to Us: Breaking RC4 in
    WPA-TKIP and TLS** (by Mathy Vanhoef, iMinds-DistriNet-KU Leuven)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *Abstract:* We present new biases in RC4, break the Wi-Fi Protected
    Access Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (WPA-TKIP), and design a
    practical plaintext recovery attack against the Transport Layer
    Security (TLS) protocol. To empirically find new biases in the RC4
    keystream we use statistical hypothesis tests. This reveals many new
    biases in the initial keystream bytes, as well as several new
    long-term biases. Our fixed-plaintext recovery algorithms are
    capable of using multiple types of biases, and return a list of
    plaintext candidates in decreasing likelihood.
    To break WPA-TKIP we introduce a method to generate a large number
    of identical packets. This packet is decrypted by generating its
    plaintext candidate list, and using redundant packet structure to
    prune bad candidates. From the decrypted packet we derive the TKIP
    MIC key, which can be used to inject and decrypt packets. In
    practice the attack can be executed within an hour. We also attack
    TLS as used by HTTPS, where we show how to decrypt a secure cookie
    with a high success rate using roughly one billion ciphertexts. This
    is done by injecting known data around the cookie, abusing this
    using Mantin's ABSAB bias, and brute-forcing the cookie by
    traversing the plaintext candidates. Using our traffic generation
    technique, we are able to execute the attack in merely 75 hours.
    *Bio:* **Mathy Vanhoef** is a PhD student at KU Leuven, where he
    performs research on RC4 and its usage in network protocols such as
    WPA-TKIP and SSL/TLS (e.g. he discovered the RC4 NOMORE attack). He
    also focuses on wireless security, where he studies MAC address
    randomization, analyzes protocols like WPA-TKIP, and implements
    low-layer Wi-Fi attacks using commodity hardware. Apart from
    research, he is also interested in low-level security, reverse
    engineering, and binary exploitation. He regularly participates in
    CTFs with KU Leuven's Hacknamstyle CTF team.

  - 20h10 - 21h00: **Docker Security** (by Nils De Moor, CTO at
    WooRank)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *Abstract:* Docker, the new kid on the block, has taken the Ops
    world by storm. Suddenly everybody wants applications to be
    containerized and kick them from a development machine up to a
    production stack in seconds. But this new paradigm obviously has
    consequences in terms of security and compliance. In this talk we'll
    look at how to construct a container around applications and dive
    deeper into how we can put a tight lock around it, thanks to the
    built-in security primitives.
    *Bio:* **Nils De Moor** is co-founder and CTO at WooRank, a SaaS
    tool for digital marketing agencies to monitor online presence of a
    brand. By grabbing and calculating millions of data points every
    day, he developed a passion for automating, scaling and distributing
    applications. Besides that he is passionate about open source
    communities and has started some initiatives, like techbelgium.io,
    Docker and AWS meetup groups, etc.

  - 19h15 - 20h15: **[Writing robust client-side code using Modern
    JavaScript](https://www.owasp.org/images/5/5f/JS_RobustModern_VanCutsem_OWASP2016.pdf)**
    (by Tom Van Cutsem, Bell Labs, Nokia)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *Abstract:* In this talk, I will take the audience on a tour of
    recent evolutions in the JavaScript language (and surrounding
    ecosystem) and how they can use these changes to their advantage to
    write better client-side code that is more robust against bugs and
    other exploits. JavaScript — still unquestionably the dominant
    client-side language in use on the Web — has evolved significantly
    over the past five years, with two significant updates to
    ECMAScript, its defining standard. I will give a brief introduction
    to the language and its Good and Bad parts and then move on to
    features added in ECMAScript 5th edition, such as "strict mode",
    which are by now widely deployed in major browsers. Next, I will
    look at relevant language features that were introduced recently as
    part of ECMAScript 6th edition. Finally, I will give a brief
    introduction to Secure ECMAScript (SES), which is a secure
    JavaScript dialect that enables the safe embedding of third-party
    scripts in a webpage, also forming the basis for Google’s Caja
    compiler.
    *Bio:* **Tom Van Cutsem** is a senior researcher at Nokia Bell Labs
    in Antwerp, Belgium. Prior to joining Bell Labs, he was a professor
    of computer science at Vrije Universiteit Brussel. He sat on the
    ECMA TC39 committee in charge of standardising JavaScript and
    actively contributed to the ECMAScript 2015 (a.k.a. “ES6”) standard.
    Together with Mark S. Miller, he designed and specified ECMAScript’s
    new reflection API. Tom's broader research interests lie in
    distributed systems, programming languages, stream processing,
    concurrency and parallelism. He received his PhD in 2008 from Vrije
    Universiteit Brussel for his research on AmbientTalk, a distributed
    scripting language for mobile phones.

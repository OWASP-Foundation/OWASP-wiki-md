Come take the official Samurai-WTF training course given by one of the
founders and lead developers of the project\! You will learn how to use
the latest Samurai-WTF open source tools and the be shown the latest
techniques to perform web application assessments. After a quick
overview of pen testing methodology, the instructor will lead you
through the penetration and exploitation of two different web
applications, including client side attacks on the browsers connecting
to those sites. Different sets of open source tools will be used on each
web application, allow you to learn first hand the pros and cons of each
tool. After you have gained experience with the Samurai-WTF tools, you
will be challenged with a third web application. This final challenge
will give you time to practice your new skills at your own pace and
experiment with your favorite new tools. This experience will help you
gain the confidence necessary to perform web application assessments and
expose you to the wealth of freely available, open source tools.

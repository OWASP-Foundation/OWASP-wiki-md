The August 15 meeting was held at Woodward Hall room 130. Our speaker
was [John Melton](User:John_Melton "wikilink"), developer for the [OWASP
AppSensor Project](OWASP_AppSensor_Project "wikilink"). Pizza was
provided.

The chapter decided that as a chapter project we should begin getting
involved in the [OWASP AppSensor
Project](OWASP_AppSensor_Project "wikilink") in various degrees.
[John](User:John_Melton "wikilink") will begin working out a list of
open bugs and enhancement requests. Also, members of the chapter are
encouraged to begin looking at implementing AppSensor in other languages
(PHP had the highest interest level during the meeting), being sure to
make it compatible as much as possible with
[ESAPI](:Category:OWASP_Enterprise_Security_API "wikilink") and the
current Java implementation of AppSensor.

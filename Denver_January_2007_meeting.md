## January 2007 Meeting

The next meeting will be on January 17, 6:30PM at EchoStar Satellite's
headquarters south of the DTC. The classroom we are meeting in can
easily hold 50 people; far more if we crowd in. This should make for
more breathing room than last month. If you think you may attend, please
RSVP to \[david.byrne@echostar.com\] with your name and company.

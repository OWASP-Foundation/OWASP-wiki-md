# How-To

## Using the OWASP Mobile App Security Verification Standard, Testing Guide and Checklist

The documents produced in this project cover many aspects of mobile
application security, from the high-level requirements to the
nitty-gritty implementation details and test cases. They can be used to
plan and verify security controls during any phase of mobile app
development, as well as during pre-release code review and penetration
testing.

1.  The [Mobile Application Security Verification Standard
    (MASVS)](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs/releases) contains
    generic security requirements along with mappings to verification
    levels that can be chosen depending on the overall need for
    security.
2.  The [Mobile Security Testing Guide
    (MSTG)](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/releases) provides
    verification instructions for each requirement in the MASVS, as well
    as security best practices for apps on each supported mobile
    operating system (currently Android and iOS). It is also useful as a
    standalone learning resource and reference guide for mobile
    application security testers.
3.  The [Mobile App Security
    Checklist](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/tree/master/Checklists)
    can be used to apply the MASVS requirements during practical
    assessments. It also conveniently links to the MSTG test case for
    each requirement, making mobile penetration testing a breeze.

It is important to note that the security standard, testing guide and
checklists are closely related: They all map to the same basic set of
requirements. Depending on the context, the documents can be used
stand-alone or in combination to achieve different objectives.

![<File:Overview-800px.jpg>](Overview-800px.jpg
"File:Overview-800px.jpg")

For example, the MASVS requirements may be used in the planning and
architecture design stages, while the checklist and testing guide may
serve as a baseline for manual security testing or as a template for
automated security tests.

## Mobile App Security Testing

The
[checklist](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/tree/master/Checklists)
works great as a reference during mobile app security assessments. You
can walk through the requirements one-by-one - for more information on
each requirement, simply click on the link in the "Testing procedures"
column. Or, fill out the checklist at the end of an assessment to ensure
completeness.

## Security Engineering in the SDLC

Properly defined security requirements are an important part of the
Secure SDLC. The
[MASVS](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs/releases/download/0.9.2/OWASP_Mobile_AppSec_Verification_Standard_v0.9.2.pdf)
levels can be used along with threat modeling to determine the
appropriate set of security controls for a particular mobile app. MASVS
V1 also lists requirements pertaining to the architecture and design of
the mobile apps, as well as general processes and activities that should
be part of the development process.

## Mobile App Security Education

The [Mobile Security Testing Guide](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg)
can be used as a standalone learning resource. Its main chapters contain
general how-tos and tutorials that cover a variety of topics from mobile
OS internals to advanced reverse engineering techniques.

# Sponsorship Packages

With the Mobile Security Testing Guide sponsorship packages, we offer
companies opportunities to create brand awareness and maximize
visibility in the mobile security space. A limited amount of sponsorship
packages will be made available shortly through our crowdfunding
campaign.

The following packages will be available (or [download as
PDF](:File:MSTG-Sponsor-Packages.pdf "wikilink") ):

### Good Samaritan (USD 500)

  - Listed as supporter on the project website and GitHub
  - Listed as supporter in the printed and ebook versions
  - 5 Paperback Books

### Honourable Benefactor (USD 2,000 / 8 Available)

  - Small company logo in the “Honourable Benefactors” section on
    project website and Github
  - Small company logo on the sponsors page of the printed and ebook
    versions
  - 10 Paperback Books

### God Mode Sponsor (USD 4,000 / 5 Available)

  - Large company logo in the “God mode sponsors” section on project
    website and Github
  - Large company logo on the sponsors page of the printed and ebook
    versions
  - 20 Paperback Books

## Pre-book a package

Contact [Sven Schleier](mailto:sven.schleier@owasp.org) to reserve your
slot. We will contact you as soon as the packages become available.

## Why Sponsors?

As it turns out, writing a book to a professional standard is a
challenging task, even more so if there's 50+ authors that aren't
necessarily native speakers. Also, professional editors, graphic
designers and layouters don't work for free. Thus, some funds are needed
to make the tech book a reality.

100% of the funds raised go directly into the project budget and will be
used to fund production of the final release, including:

  - Editing and proofreading by professional editors
  - Graphic design and layout

Any leftover funds will be donated to the OWASP Foundation to the mobile
security project for future use.

## April 15th, 2019: Book version, project promotion & preparation for the summit

Given that most news is already shared via OWASP Slack over the last
quarter, we still see that it is good to share a summary of all of the
good things outside of Slack using this news section. In this update we
have a lot to share\! While we started off this year with an improved
version of the MASVS and MSTG, things have not been quiet: there has
been a huge development in master of the MSTG and many issues have been
raised and fixed. In the meantime, we have worked on an actual print of
the book\! While an early version is available through Hulu (no link
supplied, google and buy at your own risk), we are working on making a
better version of that book. In the mean time we have filed for a
project promotion to Flagship\! Next a lot more cool things happened:
with the now official publication of [NIST Special Publication
(SP) 800-163
Revision 1](https://csrc.nist.gov/news/2019/nist-publishes-sp-800-163-rev-1),
the MASVS and MSTG are getting more mainstream ;-). The MASVS & MSTG are
mentioned in various other upcoming programs/standards/recommendations
as well, which is really a recognition of the hard work put in by the
community. We are proud to be part of such a great project\! Next, we
are preparing to join the [Open Security
Summit](https://opensecsummit.org/tracks/mobile/) again\! Already three
people will be on site, and at least one remoting, but we would love to
work with more people at the project again\! Want to know more? Please
get in touch via Slack and join the \#project-mobile_omtg channel or
follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OWASP_MSTG).

## January 15th, 2019: Release of improved checklist

We released a new version of the checklist\! This version has adaptable
references so that it can be used with newer versions of the MSTG as
well. This version is currently available in French and English and we
hope to add the Russian, Japanese, German and Spanish version soon\!
Want to know more? Take a look at [our release
page\!](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/releases/tag/1.1-excel). We
would like to thank our volunteers for their effort to deliver these
easy to use checklists\!

## January 3rd, 2019: Multilnaguage Release 1.1.2 of the MASVS

We released the 1.1.2 version of the OWASP MAVS\! This is the first
version in Chinese, English, French, German, Japanese, Russian, and
Spanish\! Exactly: we just added French, German, Japanese and Chinese\!
Obviously this would not be possible without all the volunteers that
helped us with translations, feedback, updating, and automating the
release proces\! We are grateful for the awesome team that pulled this
off\! Want to see the result? Take a look at [our release
page\!](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs/releases/tag/1.1.2)

OWASP-MSTG and/or MASVS. If you have done so and are ok with being
mentioned: please email to jeroen.willemsen@owasp.org.

## Oktober 28th, 2018: The MASVS is getting more translations

Thanks to Romuald, Koki and many others, new translations of the MASVS
are popping up. We now have a Japanese translation added and the French,
German and Persian translations are in development. Each of them will be
released the moment our release-automation of the MASVS is completed.
Until then: feel free to checkout the sources\!

## Oktober 18th, 2018: The MSTG is now officially an OWASP Lab Project\!

During AppSec US 2018 in San Jose the Mobile Security Testing Guide was
reviewed by several volunteers to assess the maturity of the project. As
a result our request for project graduation to lab status was granted.
The reviews can be found here

## September 21th, 2018: MASVS automation started

Now that the document generation process for the MSTG has been optimized
enough for milestone 1.1.0 (and we reached \#1000 in Github of issues
and Pull requests), we have started to improve the MASVS releasing
mechanism. This will be further improved after Appsec USA and the
release of 1.1.0 of the MSTG.

## September 16th, 2018: MSTG 1.0.1 released

The Mobile Security Testing Guide version 1.0.1 has been released using
our automated release system (based on tagging). See the CHANGELOG.md
for all the changes. We now have added pdf support and improved our
.docx quiet a lot. We will further improve the release process for the
pdf and epubs after milestone 1.1.0.

## Mobile Security Testing Workshop on the OWASP Summit 2017

The OWASP MSTG team is organizing a 5-days mobile security track on the
OWASP Summit 2017. The track consists of a series of book sprints, each
of which focuses on producing content for a specific section in the
OWASP MSTG, as well as proof-reading and editing the existing content.
The goal is to make as much progress on the guide as is humanly
possible. Depending on the number of participants, we’ll split into
sub-groups to work on different subsections or topic areas.

### How to Join

Join up for the working session(s) you like by following the link(s) on
the [mobile security track
page](http://owaspsummit.org/Working-Sessions/Mobile-Security/), then

The Mobile App Security Verification Standard (MASVS) has undergone a
major revision, including a re-design of the security model and
verification levels. We also revised many security requirements to
address the multitude of [issues raised on
GitHub](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20).
The result is MASVS v0.9.2, which is now [available for download in PDF
format](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs/releases/tag/0.9.2).

As the MASVS is nearing maturity, we have decided to freeze the
requirements until the Mobile Testing Guide and checklists "catch up"
(due to the one-to-one mapping between requirements in the MASVS and
MSTG, changes to the requirements make it necessary to update the other
documents as well, causing repeated effort). Unless major issues pop up,
the current list will therefore remain in place until MASVS/MSTG v1.0,
and further changes will be reserved for v1.1 or later releases.

The MASVS is a community effort to establish security requirements for
designing, developing and testing secure mobile apps on iOS and Android.

## January 28th, 2017: Mobile Crackmes and Reversing Tutorials

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><p>| <img src="uncrackable-250.png" title="fig:uncrackable-250.png" alt="uncrackable-250.png" /></p></th>
<th><p>A key goal of the OWASP Mobile Testing Project is to build the ultimate learning resource and reference guide for mobile app reversers. As hands-on hacking is by far the best way to learn, we'd like to link most of the content to practical examples.</p>
<p>Starting now, we'll be adding <a href="https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/tree/master/Crackmes">crackmes for Android and iOS</a> to the <a href="https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg">GitHub repo</a> that will then be used as examples throughout the guide. The goal is to collect enough resources for demonstrating the most important tools and techniques in our guide, plus additional crackmes for practicing. For starters there are three challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/tree/master/OMTG-Files/02_Crackmes/01_Android/01_License_Validation">Android License Validator</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/tree/master/Crackmes/iOS/Level_01/">Uncrackable App for iOS Level 1</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/tree/master/Crackmes/iOS/Level_02/">Uncrackable App for iOS Level 2</a></li>
</ul></th>
</tr>

</table>

One of these three already has a [documented
solution](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/blob/master/Document/0x05b-Reverse-Engineering-and-Tampering-Android.md#symbolicexec)
in the guide. Tutorials for solving the other two [still need to be
added](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/blob/master/OMTG-Files/02_Crackmes/List_of_Crackmes.md).

### We Need More Authors and Contributors\!

Maybe you have noticed that [the reverse engineering sections in the
Mobile Testing Guide are
incomplete](https://rawgit.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/master/Generated/OWASP-MSTG-Table-of-Contents.html).
The reason: We're still in the starting stages and don't have a lot of
authors and contributors (in fact, 99% of the reversing content was
produced by one guy). We'd love to welcome \*you\* as a contributor of
crackmes, tutorials, writeups, or simply new ideas for this project.

#### What You Can Do

The OWASP MSTG is an open project and there's a lot of flexibility - it
mostly depends on your skill set and willingness to commit your time.
That said, the some areas that need help are:

  - Solving crackmes and contributing a tutorial to the guide
    (preferable a technique that's not already documented. Check the
    [TOC](https://rawgit.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/master/Generated/OWASP-MSTG-Table-of-Contents.html)
    first).
  - Writing and adding new crackmes along with solutions (should also
    describe something not already in the guide. Cracking white-boxes,
    dynamic analysis using an emulator / introspection, etc. etc.).
  - General reversing write-ups to describe specific processes and
    techniques
  - Help us figure out [resiliency testing
    processes](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/blob/master/Document/0x07b-Assessing_Software_Protections.md)
    and [obfuscation
    metrics](https://github.com/b-mueller/obfuscation-metrics)

The reversing part of the guide consists of the following chapters:

  - [Tampering and Reverse Engineering - General
    Overview](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/blob/master/Document/0x05-Testing-Processes-and-Techniques.md#tampering-and-reverse-engineering)
  - [Tampering and Reverse Engineering on
    Android](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/blob/master/Document/0x05b-Reverse-Engineering-and-Tampering-Android.md#tampering-and-reverse-engineering-on-android)
  - [Tampering and Reverse Engineering on
    iOS](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/blob/master/Document/0x05d-Reverse-Engineering-and-Tampering-iOS.md#tampering-and-reverse-engineering-on-ios)

#### How To Join

Read the [author's
guide](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/blob/master/authors_guide.md)
first, and join the [OWASP Mobile Security Project Slack
Channel](https://owasp.slack.com/messages/project-mobile_omtg/details/),
where you'll find all the other project members. You can sign up for an
account
[here](https://join.slack.com/t/owasp/shared_invite/enQtNjExMTc3MTg0MzU4LTViMDg1MmJiMzMwZGUxZjgxZWQ1MTE0NTBlOTBhNjhhZDIzZTZiNmEwOTJlYjdkMzAxMGVhNDkwNDNiNjZiOWQ).

## January 22nd, 2017: Mobile Testing Guide TOC Available

As of now, we'll be auto-generating a [table of
contents](https://rawgit.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/master/Generated/OWASP-MSTG-Table-of-Contents.html)
out of the current MSTG master branch. This reflects the current state
of the guide, and should make it easier to coordinate work between
authors. A short-term goal is to finalize the structure of the guide so
we get a clearer picture of what will be included in the final document.
Lead authors are encouraged to complete the outline of their respective
chapters.

**On another note, we still need additional authors to help with all
sections of the guide, including mobile operating system overviews,
testing processes and techniques, and reverse engineering.** Especially
iOS authors are in short supply\! As usual, ping us on the [Slack
Channel](https://owasp.slack.com/messages/project-mobile_omtg/details/)
if you want to contribute.

## December 4th, 2016: Call For Authors: The Ultimate Open-Source Mobile App Reverse Engineering Guide

Reverse engineering is an art, and describing every available facet of
it would fill a whole library. The sheer range techniques and possible
specializations is mind-blowing: One can spend years working on a very
specific, isolated sub-problem, such as automating malware analysis or
developing novel de-obfuscation methods. For mobile app security
testers, it can be challenging to filter through the vast amount of
information and build a working methodology. Things become even more
problematic when one is tasked to assess apps that are heavily
obfuscated and have anti-tampering measures built in.

One of the main goals in the MSTG is to build the ultimate resource for
mobile reverse engineers. This includes not only basic static and
dynamic analysis, but also advanced de-obfuscation, scripting and
automation. Obviously, writing all this content is a lot of work, both
in terms of general content and OS-specific how-tos. We're therefore
looking for talented authors that want to join the project early on.
Topics include the following:

  - Basic Hybrid Static/Dynamic Analysis
  - Code Injection and Dynamic Instrumentation (Substrate, FRIDA)
  - Dynamic Binary Instrumentation (Valgrind, PIE)
  - Analysis Frameworks (Metasm / Miasm)
  - Symbolic Execution
  - DCA and DPA attacks on white-box crypto
  - Dynamic analysis frameworks (PANDA / DroidScope,...)
  - Anything else we might have missed

### What is in for me?

All of this is unpaid, volunteer work. However, depending on your
contribution, you will be named in the "lead authors" or "contributors"
list, and you'll be able to point to the fact that you co-authored the
guide. You'll also be contributing to the field, helping others who are
just starting out, and in turn becoming a happier person yourself
(reaping the full benefits of your altruism).

### Where do I sign up?

First of all, have a look at the existing RE chapters outline:

  - [Generic /
    Introduction](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/blob/master/Document/0x05-Testing-Processes-and-Techniques.md#tampering-and-reverse-engineering)
  - [Android](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/blob/master/Document/0x05b-Reverse-Engineering-and-Tampering-Android.md)
  - [iOS](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/blob/master/Document/0x05d-Reverse-Engineering-and-Tampering-iOS.md#tampering-and-reverse-engineering-on-ios)

You'll probably immediately have ideas on how you can contribute. If
that's the case, read the [author's
guide](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/blob/master/authors_guide.md)
first.

Then contact [Bernhard Mueller](https://github.com/b-mueller) - ideally
directly on the [OWASP Mobile Security Project Slack
Channel](https://owasp.slack.com/messages/project-mobile_omtg/details/),
where you'll find all the other project members. You can sign up for an
account
[here](https://join.slack.com/t/owasp/shared_invite/enQtNjExMTc3MTg0MzU4LTViMDg1MmJiMzMwZGUxZjgxZWQ1MTE0NTBlOTBhNjhhZDIzZTZiNmEwOTJlYjdkMzAxMGVhNDkwNDNiNjZiOWQ).

## Where do you guys need help the most?

There's a lot of areas where you can help out:

  - Writing original content, such as describing testing processes and
    writing test cases. We're all doing this in our spare time, which
    unfortunately means that things sometimes slow down to a crawl. If
    you're knowledgeable in some area and have time available, we'd be
    incredibly thankful to anyone who contributes, even if it's only one
    or two test cases.

<!-- end list -->

  - Reviewing content and giving feedback. The proper channel for
    questions and feedback is the GitHub issues system of the respective
    repo, contacting us on [OWASP Mobile Security Project Slack
    Channel](https://owasp.slack.com/messages/project-mobile_omtg/details/)
    is another possibility.

<!-- end list -->

  - Developing tools. For example, we still don't have an automated way
    of generating checklists out of the GitHub repo.

<!-- end list -->

  - Contributing to auxiliary projects: There are various projects that
    we support at this moment, consider: [the mobile threatmodel
    project](https://github.com/OWASP/Mobile-Threatmodel) and our own
    [Hacking
    playground](https://github.com/OWASP/MSTG-Hacking-Playground). In
    the past, there was the [obfuscation metrics
    project](https://github.com/b-mueller/obfuscation-metrics) is an
    auxiliary project that deals with specific forms of control flow and
    data obfuscation. This project needs experts in advanced obfuscation
    / de-obfuscation. Please contact us if you have experience in this
    area.

## If I am not a programmer can I participate in your project?

Yes, you can certainly participate in the project if you are not a
programmer or technical. The project needs different skills and
expertise and different times during its development. Currently, we are
looking for researchers, writers, graphic designers, and a project
administrator.

## I contributed to the original Google Doc, but I'm not credited in the new version of the MSTG?

As we migrated some of the existing content, we did our best to
backtrack the original authors and credit them appropriately. We also
added a [revision
history](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/blob/master/Document/0x02-Frontispiece.md)
that lists all the authors from old Google Docs. If you are not on that
list but feel you should be, please contact
[Sven](https://github.com/sushi2k) and he'll fix it. Or better yet,
re-join the author's team and start contributing to the new guide.

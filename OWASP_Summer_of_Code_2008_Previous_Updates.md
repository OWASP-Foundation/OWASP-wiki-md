**Subject: OWASP Summer of Code 2008 - Update/ November 24, 2008**


Hello everyone. I hope you are well.


You can see
[here](http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=pAX6n7m2zaTWMKINCNKhkQw)
and
[here](http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=pAX6n7m2zaTWE689J8nz4EA)
two excel files with a portrait of the OWASP Summer of Code 2008
situation.


We thank those of you that are keeping the schedule and we ask the
remaining ones, the vast majority, to make an effort to make up for this
delay. Please let me remind you that **we expect the final project
deliveries ready by, maximum, the first day of the OWASP Summit, namely
November 4.**


I also inform that there will not be any other postponement in this
season of code. Consequently, to be paid, the project must be completed
and reviewed by the referred date. Any hypothetical exceptions to this
rule must be authorized by OWASP Board. Hence, please allow me to repeat
myself by requesting a last effort to complete your project within the
time frame as it will mean both your much deserved payment and the
success of our Summer of Code.


On another note, to those of you that will be presenting projects at
[OWASP EU Summit 2008](:OWASP_EU_Summit_2008 "wikilink"), I ask to
assist us with the marketing effort. We want to generate as much buzz as
possible about the event over this following week. Please help us by
making a note [here](:OWASP_EU_Summit_2008_-_Marketing_Push "wikilink")
of who you are contacting and who you've contacted about your own
sessions and projects. Please try to get 2-3 other people to come along
but, be aware, that given budget limitations, those people must pay
entirely for their costs. We are counting on you to divulge as much as
possible this worldwide worth going event\!


I take the opportunity to challenge you all to present an application to
the next season of code. Even though the schedule is not already
stabilized, we already know that the process of launching the Winter of
Code 2009 will be triggered at the Summit. We are planning a [Work
Session](:Working_Session_Winter_of_Code_2009 "wikilink") to do so and
it configures the perfect opportunity to weigh up the work that we have
been doing and to shape our next program. What’s more, your application,
if totally ready, may be immediately approved\!


For now it’s all except for a personal note. I am longing to personally
meet those of you that won’t make our next gathering in Portugal and
very thrilled with the prospect of being acquainted with the larger part
that will be there – working with/for you has been a true pleasure.


Many thanks, best regards, Paulo Coimbra, OWASP Project Manager.

Subject: **OWASP Summit EU Portugal 2008 - booking flights and hotel
accommodation.**

Dear Summit Participants,

I hope you are well.

Time flies, and, being roundly 35 days to the beginning of our great
[OWASP EU Summit Portugal 2008](OWASP_EU_Summit_2008 "wikilink"), it
seems the perfect time to deal with the question of booking flights and
hotel accommodation.

As you already know, the event will be held at [Hotel Santa
Eulália](http://www.granderealsantaeulaliahotel.com/index.html),
Algarve, Portugal and [(Faro is the nearest
airport)](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Aeroporto+de+Faro,+Montenegro,+Faro,+8005,+Portugal&ie=UTF8&ll=37.096812,-7.967834&spn=0.502766,1.235962&z=10&iwloc=addr).
Nevertheless, to reach the venue, depending on your place of departure,
a few routes and combinations of flights, transfers and trains will be
possible.

We have made an agreement with a Travel Agency, [Diplomata
Tours](http://www.diplomatatours.pt/owasp.php), to assist you in all
this process. We are sure that they will offer you an efficient service.
You can take the initiative of contacting them but I have already sent
them off your email addresses and instructed them to get in touch with
you as soon as possible. Therefore, although I will be here to assist if
needed, all details must be sorted out directly trough the Agency
channel.

Our agreement with the Agency in terms of flight and transfers costs
consists in having prices through them at least as cheap as one can find
on-line.

Please, be aware that the final price presented to you by the Agency
will include the price of the flight(s) and the cost of the needed
transfer.

The established general rule consists in finding and buying for you the
cheapest price available in the market for the needed combination of
flights and transfers - this price will be sponsored by OWASP up to USD
600 for European attendees and up to USD 1000 for non-European ones.

Nevertheless, of course, the Agency can provide you other solutions,
i.e., tickets upgrades and extra services as, for example, rental cars,
but, in this case, you must pay for the additional cost.

As said before, if you need a single room because you are traveling with
a companion, you can ask for the upgrade by paying roundly more Euros
60/day.

As you have noticed, yes, we have increased the sponsorship in USD 100.
We are doing our bit to provide you the best conditions possible to
attend the Summit. However, we repeat our previous appeal: if you can
convince your company to pay for some or all of your expenses please do
so and, on the other flip of the coin, we can advertise its logo at the
conference materials. Doing so, you will hep us with having even more
sponsored participants.

Regarding the hotel booking, the Agency will take care of that as well.
They will book for you having into consideration your flight dates.

In this field, our compromise remains as previously established:

1\. With the exceptions below, all accommodation and meal expenses,
during all the four days, will be paid.

2\. The meals consist of a pre-negotiated menu and just this will be
paid.

3\. As we are still seeking out for financial sponsorship support, until
further notice, none of the dinners will be paid.

4\. The accommodation will consist in a place in a shared T 1 (3 people)
or T2 (5 people) apartment. Therefore, even though one can choose an
individual room, OWASP will pay only for the cost associated with a
shared stay.

5\. Please note that the nights of 3 and 7 of Nov will be included in
the paid accommodation for those of you attending the whole event.

As said before, I will be here if you need further assistance, however,
all booking details must be sorted out directly trough the Agency
channel - our main contacts there are: - Maria José Madeira
(diplo@diplomatatours.pt, phone 00.351.213.558.963), - Nuno Fernandes
(nuno.fernandes@diplomatatours.pt, phone 00.351.966.869.085).

For now, it is all. I thank the time you have spent to read this long
email.

Keep up the good work - I am looking forward to seeing you in Portugal\!

Many thanks, best regards,
Paulo Coimbra,
OWASP Foundation Project Manager

  - **SEPTEMBER 7, 2008**

Hello everyone,

I hope you are well.

Time flies, and as you know, we are almost reaching September 15, the
initially established OWASP Summer of Code 2008 (SoC’s) deadline.

Therefore, less than ten days to the season of code’s expiring date, we
thank those of you that are keeping the schedule and we challenge the
remainder to make an effort to make up for this delay.

However, as we are working to have as many of you as possible attending
the OWASP EU Summit Portugal 2008, we have decided to postpone the
above-referred deadline to the possible maximum – **the new SoC’s
deadline will be the first day of the Summit, that is to say November
4**.

We are still shaping the [event wiki
page](OWASP_EU_Summit_2008 "wikilink") but it was already agreed to hold
a four-day OWASP gathering to discuss OWASP strategic issues and present
all OWASP relevant projects. This first OWASP Summit will take place in
Algarve [(Faro is the nearest
airport)](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Aeroporto+de+Faro,+Montenegro,+Faro,+8005,+Portugal&ie=UTF8&ll=37.096812,-7.967834&spn=0.531245,1.235962&z=10&iwloc=addr),
Portugal, in the well-equipped seaside [Hotel Santa
Eulália](http://www.granderealsantaeulaliahotel.com/index.html),
between the 4th and the 7th of November 2008.

In the first two days, the event will have the format of Working
Sessions to openly discuss and decide on several OWASP projects and
issues, e.g., OWASP Strategic Planning, OWASP Top 10 2009, Winter Of
Code 2009, EASPI Project, Code Review Version 2, Testing Guide Version
4, OWASP Application Security Desk Reference (ASDR), OWASP
Certifications, OWASP Awards and OWASP Website. Of course, we count on
you to join the discussion and contribute to the final decisions.

As announced before, the remaining period of two days will consist of a
two-day conference, where more than 40 OWASP specific presentations will
be held. Again, we most definitely count on you to present your project.

'''Regarding the rules to qualify to have the Summit attendance expenses
partially paid, we are also setting up the following: '''

1.  Until September 15, at least the 50% completion point must have been
    reached, the 50% self-evaluation must have been performed and, at
    least, one of the two reviews must have been done.
2.  Until September 15, both project leaders and reviewers must sign
    their intention of attending the Summit by adding their names
    [**here**](OWASP_EU_Summit_2008_Paid_Participants "wikilink").
3.  Until November 4, the project must be entirely complete, reviewed
    and ready to be publicly presented at the Summit.
4.  Exceptions to these rules can be considered by OWASP Board under
    formal request made until September 15 by project leaders whose
    projects are specially extensive and complex.

**In what respects to the level of expenses that will be paid, the
following rules have been established:**

1.  With the exceptions below, all accommodation and meal expenses,
    during all the four days, will be paid.
2.  As we are still seeking out for financial sponsorship support, until
    further notice, none of the dinners will be paid.
3.  The meals consist of a pre-negotiated menu and just this will be
    paid.
4.  The accommodation will consist in a place in a shared T 1 (3 people)
    or T2 (5 people) apartment. Therefore, even though one can choose an
    individual room, OWASP will pay only for the cost associated with a
    shared stay.
5.  Please note that the nights of 3 and 7 of Nov will be included in
    the paid accommodation for those of you attending the whole event.
6.  Regarding the flight expenses, OWASP will pay a maximum of 900 US
    dollars to all non-European attendees and 500 to the European ones.
7.  The operational model to book accommodations and flights is not
    finished yet but, as soon as possible, more details will be given.

On the whole, if you accept our challenge to be at the OWASP EU Summit
2008 to present your project and engage the discussion at one, or more,
Working Sessions and if you qualify to have your expenses partially
paid, please add your name right
[**here**](OWASP_EU_Summit_2008_Paid_Participants "wikilink"). Please do
**not forget to add the name of your city/airport of departure**.

Nevertheless, although we start with a good budget to cover expenses
(150,000 USD), it will not be enough to cover the current projected
number of OWASP participants. Therefore, if you can convince your
company to pay for some or all of your expenses please do so and, on the
other flip of the coin, we can advertise its logo at the conference
materials - more details about sponsorship opportunities will be sent
later on.

To conclude, I will be here if you need further assistance, however, as
I am releasing all the information and details already stabilized, the
best way to keep yourself up to date and informed about the event is to
visit regularly its wiki page.

Keep up the good work - I am looking forward to seeing you in Portugal\!

Many thanks, best regards,

Paulo Coimbra, OWASP Foundation Project Manager

  - **AUGUST 24, 2008**
  - Hi OWASP community,
  - I hope you are well.
  - As you all know, we have announced before the organization of a
    conference in Portugal 100% dedicated to OWASP – the [OWASP EU
    Summit 2008](:OWASP_EU_Summit_2008 "wikilink").
  - We are planning to make it a big, productive and interesting OWASP
    gathering, also with many non-OWASP attendees and external relevant
    speakers.
  - Beyond the software security relevant questions addressed by
    selected industry representatives, the idea is to discuss the open
    source answer to those issues by presenting all the most relevant
    work done within the OWASP context. We will also take the
    opportunity to discuss the OWASP strategic positioning for 2009.
  - We are on our way to finish all the details concerning the venue –
    it’s likely that it will happen in Portugal, Algarve. We are
    counting on having this question totally solved within the next
    week.
  - We also have begun the process of selecting the OWASP member
    attendees/speakers and, if you are a relevant OWASP participant, we
    are inviting you as well.
  - To be considered a relevant OWASP participant you must belong to
    one, or more, of the following categories:

<!-- end list -->

1.  OWASP Summer of Code 2008 project leaders & reviewers,
2.  OWASP Summer of Code 2008 special project contributors,
3.  OWASP Spring of Code 2007 project leaders & reviewers,
4.  OWASP Autumn of Code 2006 project leaders & reviewers,
5.  Active Project Leaders (not currently participating on SoC 08),
6.  Active Chapter Leaders,
7.  Member with significant past OWASP Contribution.

<!-- end list -->

  - In addition, regarding the categories between 1, 3 and 4, we will
    consider relevant OWASP participant only those who have timely
    delivered their projects or have timely performed their reviews.
  - Regarding the category 2, up to ten project contributors will be
    chosen by OWASP Board having into consideration the supported and
    detailed proposals made by the SoC’s projects authors.
  - Regarding the category 5, we will consider relevant OWASP
    participant only those with projects in activity and the OWASP Board
    will judge that by checking if any significant update on the project
    page was done in the last six months.
  - Regarding the category 6, we will consider relevant OWASP
    participant only those with chapters in activity and the OWASP Board
    will judge that by checking if any significant activity was done in
    the last six months.
  - The last category, the seventh one, was deliberately created to
    assure that nobody with relevant past OWASP contributions will be
    excluded. As this judgement will be necessarily subjective and
    casuistic, it will be OWASP Board’s responsibility. However, you can
    present your application.

**\* Hence, to those of you that fit the criteria, are planning to
attend the conference and haven’t said so yet, I ask to fill in
[**here**](OWASP_EU_Summit_2008#Provisory_list_of_'expenses_paid'_participants "wikilink")
as soon as possible. To the others, I ask to go to the same wiki page
and add the name of the city/airport of departure.**

  - In terms of financial support, our goal is to cover as much of the
    flight and accommodation expenses as possible but we are not sure
    still about what eventually it will mean, as it will depend on how
    many attendees we will have.
  - Although we start with a good budget to cover expenses (150,000
    USD), it will not be enough to cover the current projected number of
    OWASP participants (200 people). Therefore, if you can convince your
    company to pay for some or all of your expenses please do so and, on
    the other flip of the coin, we can advertise its logo at the
    conference materials - more details about sponsorship opportunities
    will be sent later on.
  - Fell free to contact me, or the [OWASP EU Summit 2008
    Team](mailto:owasp-summit-europe-2008@lists.owasp.org), if you have
    questions about this conference, but please beware that I will be
    out of office until next Thursday as I will be in Lisbon and Algarve
    with Dinis Cruz to try to sort out all the venue details.
  - Many thanks, best regards,
  - Paulo Coimbra,

OWASP Foundation Project Manager

  - **AUGUST 20:**
  - Hello everyone. I hope you are well.
  - You can see
    [here](http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pAX6n7m2zaTVmNOSWu4sUYQ)
    an excel file with a portrait of the OWASP Summer of Code 2008
    situation.
  - We thank those of you that are keeping the schedule, the vast
    majority, and we ask the remaining ones to make an effort to make up
    for this delay. Once again, please let me remind you that we expect
    the final project deliveries ready by, maximum, September 15.
  - With respect to the review process, we reaffirm the recommendations
    made previously and, in addition, we ask you to give a glance at our
    [‘assessment guidance’
    post](http://owaspsoc2008.wordpress.com/2008/07/15/assessment-guidance/)
    and to pay special attention to the need of avoiding claims of
    plagiarism by always citing your sources.
  - Regarding the [OWASP EU Summit
    2008](OWASP_EU_Summit_2008 "wikilink") organization, even though the
    planning process it’s a bit delayed, we are still aiming to hold it
    on 6th and 7th November. We are planning to make it a big,
    productive and interesting OWASP gathering, also with many non-OWASP
    attendees and relevant speakers and, as you know, we really would
    like to have you all in there. As said before, to be eligible for
    OWASP financial support you just need to comply with your SoC 2008
    objectives.
  - We are keeping the goal of paying for all of the flight and
    accommodation expenses but we are not sure still. It will depend on
    how many attendees we will have and how much it will cost. Hence, to
    those of you that are planning to attend the conference and haven’t
    said so yet, I ask to fill in
    [**here**](OWASP_EU_Summit_2008#Provisory_list_of_'expenses_paid'_participants "wikilink")
    as soon as possible. To the others, I ask to go to the same wiki
    page and add the name of the city/airport of departure.
  - Regarding operational matters, it’s all for today - we are counting
    on you and I whish you all good work.
  - Many thanks, best regards, Paulo Coimbra, OWASP Foundation Project
    Manager

    post on OWASP projects review task**\]

<!-- end list -->

  - **JULY 14:**
  - Hello everyone,
  - I hope you all are well.
  - I am pleased to announce, finally, that
    [all](OWASP_Summer_of_Code_2008_Projects_Authors_Status_Target_and_Reviewers "wikilink")
    proposed OWASP Summer of Code’s 2008 reviewers have been confirmed
    by OWASP Board.
  - It should have been done before, at least a couple of weeks ago but,
    unfortunately, given the complexity of the process – taking into
    consideration the new OWASP assessment criteria, 70 reviewers were
    matched with 33 projects - it wasn’t possible.
  - Therefore, I would like to thank you all for your patience and
    support and, particularly, those who, even without OWASP Board’s
    confirmation, have accepted the risk and have already finished their
    review.
  - With respect to the review process, I take the opportunity to
    suggest to you a couple of recommendations, as following:
      - keep the project template page updated at all times with all
        relevant links, documents and contents.
      - keep the project template page updated at all times with all
        relevant commentaries made during the review work.
      - Use always the project mailing list to exchange emails regarding
        all matters related with the project progress or review.
  - Furthermore, studying the review process methodology, I found a
    couple of links that I thought that could be of help. For your
    consideration:
      - [Seven Deadly Sins of Software
        Reviews](http://www.processimpact.com/articles/revu_sins.html),
      - [Scientific Papers and
        Presentations](http://www.google.com/books?id=hk-bqFgVrZYC&printsec=frontcover&sig=ACfU3U2mwRtMFy4ixHfiLN5-Cd3uYvr5rQ&hl=en),
      - [Virtual peer review: teaching and learning about writing in
        online
        environments](http://www.google.com/books?id=pJrA8TPrBaIC&printsec=frontcover&sig=ACfU3U3fdf4iPCbEQOE-bc8AGoHN2mOx7Q),
      - [Software testing and continuous quality
        improvement](http://www.google.com/books?id=896o2XDH9CkC&printsec=frontcover&sig=ACfU3U3V9E8EnhJ6O4QAf5uYqS5L0PBAIQ).
  - On another note, regarding the payment process please pay attention
    to the following:
      - I will be waiting for a project’s leader email stating that the
        self-review **and** the two reviews were finished.
      - Thereafter, I will request the payment, the Board will approve
        and Alison will pay.
      - Please, as soon as possible, send your postal address and Pay
        Pal reference off to Alison (alison.mcnamee@owasp.org). Those
        who have already sent it to me do not need to repeat the
        dispatch.
      - Payments to American SoC’s participants can be made by check.
      - The payment status for all and each project can be followed
        here.
  - Regarding the [OWASP EU Summit
    2008](OWASP_EU_Summit_2008 "wikilink") organization, even though the
    process it is also delayed, the logistics contacts have begun and
    the [Portuguese Caloust
    Gulbenkian](http://www.gulbenkian.pt/index.php?article=366) was
    contacted. In addition, the process of building a team to assume the
    responsibility for this event was begun and the initial discussion
    can be seen
    [here](http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pAX6n7m2zaTXOoAbaMx5CSA).
  - Therefore, please don’t forget that we expect the final project
    deliveries ready by, maximum, 15th September, to publicly present
    them at the referred conference.
  - To conclude, please, be aware that, between July 28 and August 8, I
    have planned to have two weeks holiday. Hence, if you have urgent
    matters for me to deal with you have two weeks.
  - I wish you all good work.

Many thanks, best regards, Paulo Coimbra, OWASP Foundation Project

  - [OWASP EU Summit 2008 -
    update](OWASP_EU_Summit_2008_-_updates "wikilink").

<!-- end list -->

  - **JUNE 26:**
  - As you know, we have almost reached the time to perform the 50%
    review.
  - However, it’s time to recognize that we have been somewhat imprecise
    in our definition of the 50% review‘s deadline. To have all projects
    reviewed, we should have defined a period, a start and an end date,
    instead of a specific day. Therefore, regarding this matter, we will
    not be strict.

<!-- end list -->

  - On the contrary, please be aware that we expect the final deliveries
    ready by, maximum, 15th September, as we are planning to set up an
    [International Conference](OWASP_EU_Summit_2008 "wikilink") to
    publicly present them.

<!-- end list -->

  - However, we are still recommending June 29 to be assumed as the
    reference date to begin this process.

<!-- end list -->

  - In accordance, we would like to see each project template being
    updated until the referred date (June 29) by uploading in there all
    project main links and documentation as can be seen, for example,
    [here](:Category:OWASP_Sqlibench_Project "wikilink") or
    [here](:Category:OWASP_Skavenger_Project "wikilink"). Thereafter,
    both author’s project and reviewers should begin the assessment
    task. – As we are still receiving questions inquiring about the
    assessment/review methodology, I am sending again a couple of
    guidance lines (see please the page bottom).

<!-- end list -->

  - Regarding the provisory pointed out reviewers, as not everybody have
    yet done what was asked in the previous SoC’s update, I must
    reiterate the following requests:
      - Please add the note ‘Confirmed’ or ‘Unconfirmed’ directly on
        this
        [page](OWASP_Summer_of_Code_2008_Projects_Authors_Status_Target_and_Reviewers "wikilink"),
        just below the reviewers names. Please, pay special attention if
        you find the reference TBC (To be confirmed).
      - Please, ask your reviewers for them to add, as soon as possible,
        just below their names, a link with a couple of lines mentioning
        their professional background - as you know this information
        will be needed to achieve OWASP Board’s confirmation.

<!-- end list -->

  - Please, send me off your postal address and Pay Pal reference. Once
    the 50% review is finished, we will need it to pay.

<!-- end list -->

  - To conclude, regarding the projects that haven’t yet found the
    required reviewers, I take the opportunity to ask the authors [drop
    me a line](mailto:paulo.coimbra@owasp.org%7Cto) if assistance is
    needed.

  - In addition, as you will see, the text that I have chosen to

  - **The reviewer’s question/OWASP EU Summit 2008.**
  - To deal with it, I have created a new page
    [here](:OWASP_Summer_of_Code_2008_Projects_Authors_Status_Target_and_Reviewers "wikilink").
  - To begin with, the referred page includes a field named Status
    Target. I have filled it in accordance with the [SoC’s operational
    rules](:OWASP_Summer_of_Code_2008#Operational_Rules "wikilink"). So,
    if any of you disagrees with my criterion, please let me know.
  - Next, regarding the provisory pointed out reviewers, please allow
    me, I have a couple of requests for you:
      - Please confirm that no mistake was made and feel free to change
        it, directly on the referred page, in accordance with your own
        choice if you find any error or misunderstanding. Please, pay
        special attention if you find the reference TBC (To be
        confirmed).
      - Please, ask your reviewers for them to add, as soon as possible,
        just below their names, a link with a couple of lines mentioning
        their professional background - as you know this information
        will be needed to achieve OWASP Board’s confirmation.
  - Taking the opportunity, regarding the roles of reviewers and
    contributors, we recommend keeping a clear distinction between them.
    No one working as author/contributor should act simultaneously as
    reviewer in the same project. We believe that clear and distinctive
    roles create the scientific/technical conditions to have final
    improved deliveries and we hope that you can agree with us.
  - With respect to your project page, it goes without saying that I am
    delayed. Please forgive me. I have already initiated this process
    and I am counting on finishing it very soon. However, your help
    would be very much appreciated - if you want to take a stab at
    setting it up, you can use the
    [Skavenger](:Project_Information:template_SKAVENGER "wikilink")
    template as example. Otherwise, I will do it for you.
  - Concerning the good news that I’ve promised in my last update, I am
    very glad to announce that we are planning to invite all SoC’s
    authors and reviewers to attend a conference to publicly present the
    deliveries.
  - The rules to attend the referred conference are far from being
    finalized or definitively established, although I can anticipate
    that we are planning to pay part, at least, of the flights and
    accommodation expenses. Concerning this matter, please, don’t get
    back to me asking for additional information - you can follow all
    the issue [here](:OWASP_EU_Summit_2008 "wikilink") as I have not,
    for now, additional information. I am very thrilled with this
    scenario and I hope you find it worth doing.
  - As always, we are counting on you to support OWASP.
  - Keep up the good work and, please do not forget that we have the 50%
    review scheduled to June 29th.
  - Many thanks, best regards
  - Paulo Coimbra

  - **MAY 26:**
      - **Update made in OWASP Summer of Code 2008 set of rules.**
      - The specificity of the documentation projects, and the
        remarkable extension and complexity of some of them, has been
        mentioned by a few authors/project leaders.
      - Hence, regarding the question of the number of the reviewers for
        each documentation project, we have decided to propose you a new
        frame to deal with that matter.
      - That is to say, we are proposing to have one reviewer for each
        200 pages of content.
      - However, all projects have to have, at least, two reviewers.
      - Regarding the associated question of payment, as we have assumed
        before, we will reward this contribution either with a free
        ticket to attend the OWASP NYC AppSec 2008 Conference or with
        12, 5% of the value of the project to be reviewed.

  - **MAY 14:**

**0. Call for OWASP Summer of Code’s 2008 Reviewers.**

  - As you probably already know, OWASP has awarded 31 grants to
    promising application security researchers as part of the OWASP
    Summer of Code 2008 (SoC 2008).
  - As a result, we are seeking out for project reviewers so as to have
    all these projects assessed.
  - Consequently, if you are interested in performing such task, please
    don’t hesitate and let us know as soon as possible. As a volunteer
    organization, we rely absolutely on your contribution. Hence, we
    lively encourage you to put forward your application to assume this
    reviewer role.
  - To make your decision please look at the following information:

**1. Where are the projects to review?**

  - These projects can be found
    [here](OWASP_Summer_0f_Code_2008_:_Selection#OWASP_Summer_of_Code_2008_Applications_-_Final_Assessment "wikilink").

**2. What are the reviewers’ main tasks?**

  - A. The main tasks are the result of a set of rules previously
    established in both the [OWASP Summer of Code 2008
    initiative](OWASP_Summer_of_Code_2008 "wikilink") and the [OWASP
    Project Assessment
    criteria](:Category:OWASP_Project_Assessment "wikilink").
  - B. To exemplify, please take into consideration the .
  - C. Simplifying , I would say that the work review will basically
    consist in certifying that the [project’s objectives and
    deliveries](OWASP_Summer_of_Code_2008_Applications_-_Need_Futher_Clarifications#Skavenger "wikilink")
    were accomplished and, taking into consideration the [OWASP Project
    Assessment criteria](:Category:OWASP_Project_Assessment "wikilink"),
    in certifying that the Beta Status was reached. Additionally we
    expect the reviewer always to be available to provide useful advice
    to the project developer. These tasks must be performed twice: the
    first one, the 50% Review, by June 29 and the second one, the Final
    Review, by September 15.
  - D. Regarding the question of the project status, it is important to
    clarify that, even though the majority of the projects have to reach
    Beta status, there are also some others, in which the status target
    is Release Quality. That is to say, that each project built on
    previous work done within OWASP [(Existing OWASP
    Projects)](:Category:OWASP_Project "wikilink") should obtain
    Reviewers’ agreement that a Release Quality stage was achieved.

**3. Who can be a reviewer?**

  - If you are interested in contributing and feeling comfortable with
    the technical matters in question, you can be project reviewer. We
    encourage also the OWASP Summer of Code 2008 participants to take
    part in reviewing someone else’s SoC 2008 project. However, please
    pay attention to the fact that, at least, one of the two Project
    Reviewers should be an OWASP Project or Chapter Leader.

**4. Will this work be paid?**

  - Well, in terms of paying the market value of your work, we wouldn’t
    dare say ‘yes’. However, we will reward this contribution either
    with a free ticket to attend the [OWASP NYC AppSec 2008
    Conference](OWASP_NYC_AppSec_2008_Conference "wikilink") or with
    12,5% of the value of the project to be reviewed.

**5. Where can I find the project’s progress page in which I am
interested?** That is to ask, where can I find the page similar to the
one?

  - Currently, nowhere, but very soon each project will be supplied with
    its own progress page.

**6. So, if I am interested in being one of the reviewers, how should I
proceed?**

  - A. Please [drop me a line](mailto:paulo.coimbra@owasp.org) to let me
    know about your interest.
  - B. I will put you in direct contact with the project’s author.
  - C. Having reached the author’s agreement, please inform us.
  - D. As all reviewers must have OWASP Board approval, we will inform
    you as soon as possible about their decision.

  - **APRIL 30:**
      - With regard to the progress pages, we are still working on a
        sample of it. You can see
        [here](Project_Information:template_SKAVENGER "wikilink") and
        [here](:Category:OWASP_Skavenger_Project "wikilink") what we are
        doing. Once we have it finalized, we’ll get back to you.
        However, if you need right now to have a wiki page to carry on
        with your work, you can create your own on the [section of
        Season of Code Projects at the OWASP projects
        page](:Category:OWASP_Project#Season_of_Code_Projects "wikilink")
        – later on it can be adapted in accordance with the proposed
        model.
      - This situation above has also an impact on the reviewers’
        question. We’ve decided to add in the referred above model the
        specifications to have in consideration for the work review.
        Hence, we are planning to focus again on finding reviewers only
        after the model is finished. However, it will happen very soon.
        Besides, for your information, we are planning to offer to every
        SoC’s reviewer either a free ticket to attend the [OWASP NYC
        AppSec 2008
        Conference](OWASP_NYC_AppSec_2008_Conference "wikilink") or
        12,5% of the value of the project to be reviewed.

  - **APRIL 17:**
      - We announce the results of the assessment of OWASP Summer of
        Code’s 2008 applications that [*' can be found
        here*'](OWASP_Summer_0f_Code_2008_:_Selection "wikilink").
      - As a swift overview, we would say that **we have received 35
        applications of which 31 were already accepted**. In addition,
        two applications are waiting for Jury’s decision yet and two
        more were withdrawn by the author.
      - Consequently, except for the former two applications referred
        above, **we declare that the working period for the OWASP Summer
        of Code 2008 has already begun**.

<!-- end list -->

  - **MARCH 31:**
      - **We announce a two-week-delay in the assessment of OWASP Summer
        of Code’s 2008 applications.** We are now planning to deliver
        our assessment on the 16th April. Hence, the whole SoC’s 2008
        schedule will be postponed two weeks.
      - Having carefully analysed the set of 35 applications, we have
        decided to request that 18 applicants adjust their proposals.
        [**These 18 applications can be found
        here**](OWASP_Summer_of_Code_2008_Applications_-_Need_Futher_Clarifications "wikilink").
          - As you will see, for each one, we have posted a couple of
            recommendations. Consequently, we ask that each applicant
            answer just below our recommendations, whether or not they
            are accepted. If so, please leave a clear note of it and
            modify accordingly your applications in the same wiki page.
          - **We also recommend that you state your positions by the 9th
            of April.**
      - The remaining set of applications can be found on either the
        [**Majority Vote
        Page**](http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pAX6n7m2zaTXckoJGOB0_LA)
        or [**Selection Criteria
        Page**](http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pAX6n7m2zaTXfkbcvHAVnUA&gid=0).
        Although the new official date to announce the SoC’s 2008 is now
        the 16th of April, we will post our assessment as soon as it has
        been reached. At this moment, the applicants can of course start
        working. However, we will return to you all later, once the
        assessment process has been totally completed, with further
        details.
      - **We understand the inconvenience that this might cause and
        apologise for that. Although, as we are acting to improve the
        SoC’s final deliveries, we also ask for your understanding and
        we thank you in advance.**

  - **MARCH 25:** Submission period is now closed. The final decision
    will be announced
    [**HERE**](OWASP_Summer_0f_Code_2008_:_Selection "wikilink") on the

    fund wasn’t already submitted just because you are stuck with doubts
    about a work line to follow, **you can skim over the new and greatly
    improved [Request for Proposal
    List](OWASP_Request_for_Proposal_List "wikilink") to find a
    wide-range of options**.

## Abstract: Lock picks, BumpKeys, and Hackers oh my\! How secure is your application?

This talk will focus on physical security controls, weaknesses, and
counter measures. I will present on what lock picking is, how bump keys
work, and ways to subverting electronic locks. We will also go into what
are good controls, and what is often overlooked when designing secure
environments. Many of the topics covered apply to application security,
as the methods for securing these devices is by using obscurity. In the
application world with automated tools and scripts, this does not hold
water for very long.

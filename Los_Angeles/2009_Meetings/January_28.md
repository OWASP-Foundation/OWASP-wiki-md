## *Topic: Building Security into the Test Organization*

## *Speaker: Ben Walther*

Ben Walther firmly believes testers have a wonderfully devious mindset,
and has been promoting the idea of "security testing" at Cigital's
clients, at OWASP events, and to any friends and relatives who will
listen. To this end, with the aid of O'Reilly media, Ben Walther and
Paco Hope recently published a book entitled the "Web Security Testing
Cookbook." Everyone is welcome to join us at our chapter meetings.
Meeting agenda will be sent to the Los Angeles OWASP mailing list prior
to the meeting. List archives are also available for members who want to
take a look at the latest discussion topics prior to the event.

## *Abstract:Building Security into the Test Organization*

The common approach to detecting web security issues is still the
regular application of a post-release pen-test or tool based scan. These
last minute examinations rarely live up to broader organizational goals;
they can be difficult to repeat, measure, or optimize over time. Most of
all they're expensive: they find bugs late in the lifecycle. This talk
recommends moving security testing responsibility within the test team
itself. The approach discussed will work with-or-without the existence
of explicit security requirements. See how security testing has been
applied at other organizations and how it might be customized for yours.

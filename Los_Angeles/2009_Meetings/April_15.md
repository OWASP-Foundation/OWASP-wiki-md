## Abstract: Cross Site Scripting, Exploits and Defenses

For a long time, the impact of XSS vulnerabilities has been grossly
underestimated. Recent compromises, such as the pro-Hillary
[defacement](http://cyberinsecure.com/hacked-obama-site-redirects-visitors-to-clintons-site/)
of Barack Obama's website, and a [Viral XSS in
Twitter](http://www.securescience.net/twoubledtwitter.html) demonstrated
the impact of XSS vulnerabilities to the masses.

During this presentation, David Campbell will demonstrate exactly how
effective XSS vulns can be, and show you what you can do to protect
yourself and your sites.

This presentation was originally delivered to OWASP Colorado in May of
2008, and has been updated for this session.

## **Abstract: NoSQL Security**

NoSQL databases are rapidly gaining popularity, especially for use in
distributed, high-availability cloud services. But are we making the
same mistakes with NoSQL in the childhood of the cloud that we made with
SQL in the childhood of the web? This talk will examine some general
security issues that come with emphasizing the Availability aspect of
Consistency/Availability/Partition-tolerance, and we'll also look at
some specific issues with popular NoSQL databases such as MongoDB and
Cassandra.

Abstract: Database Security in the Real World**

This presentation will provide an overview of the common threats and
vectors that are leveraged by real world attackers to gain unauthorized
access to high value databases. It is well understood that high value
databases support critical applications and store sensitive information,
but they can also be used to escalate privileges in Windows environments
and propagate botnets across the internet. This presentation will
provide developers and system administrators with a better understanding
of how those attacks are conducted.

## Abstract: Automated Detection of Security Flaws in Ruby on Rails Code

Ruby on Rails is a popular web framework which is rapidly being adopted
by companies. While Ruby is a very dynamic language, Rails’ adherence to
the concept of “convention over configuration” has made it possible to
create a capable, open source static analysis tool called “Brakeman” for
finding security vulnerabilities at the source code level. Hudson –
recently renamed Jenkins – is a continuous integration system which can
be configured to run and monitor a wide variety of jobs. This talk will
focus on the advantages of using static analysis for discovering
security issues, and demonstrate how easy it is automatically monitor
vulnerabilities in Ruby on Rails applications during all stages of
development using Brakeman and Jenkins.

## Abstract: Entitlements Management: Security and policies for SOA using XML appliances

Loosely coupled Web Services can be insecure as, by their very nature,
are exposed to application consumers. Security built into XML appliances
alleviates the developer with the burden of coding security and policies
into their application, freeing the developer to concentrate on conding
business processes. This evenings meeting will discuss SOA security
challenges and introduce the Layer7 XML appliance that allows for
dynamic policies to be configured on the fly using an intuitive user
interface.

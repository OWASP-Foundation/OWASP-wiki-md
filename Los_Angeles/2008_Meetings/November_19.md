## Abstract: A new web attack vector: [Script Fragmentation](http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Security/Security-Researcher-to-Reveal-New-Web-Attack-Vector/)

This presentation will introduce a new web-based attack vector which
utilizes client-side scripting to fragment malicious web content.
This involves distributing web exploits in a asynchronous manner to
evade signature detection. Similar to TCP fragmentation attacks, which
are still an issue in current IDS/IPS products, This attack vector
involves sending any web exploit in fragments and uses the already
existing components within the web browser to reassemble and execute the
exploit.
Our presentation will discuss this attack vector used to evade both
gateway and client side detection. We will show several proof of
concepts containing common readily available web exploits.

## Abstract: Don't Write Your Own Security Code

Application security is arguably the most difficult IT challenge facing
organizations today. There are over 600 different categories of
vulnerabilities to avoid and they are all tricky. Most of these problems
are related to the design, implementation, and use of a relatively small
set of security controls. To solve this problem for developers, Jeff
created the OWASP ESAPI project â€“ a clean intuitive toolbox of the core
security building blocks that every web developer needs. In this talk,
Jeff will show you how to create an ESAPI for your organization that
will solve the OWASP Top Ten vulnerabilities, increase assurance, and
dramatically cut costs all at the same time.

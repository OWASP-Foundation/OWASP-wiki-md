## Topic: BOOK PREVIEW: Webbots, Spiders, and Screen Scrapers SECOND EDITION

Michael Schrenk will provide a preview of the largely expanded second
edition of his book "Webbots, Spiders, and Screen Scrapers". This second
edition describes how technologies like JavaScript, AJAX and Flash
challenge webbot developers and how those challenges are met. He will
also talk about defeating CAPTCHAs, scalability and other related
topics.

## Speaker: Michael Schrenk

Michael Schrenk is a software developer, author and instructor, who
specializes in automated web browsing agents known as webbots. Michael
uses the Internet in new and innovative (odd?) ways to provide
competitive advantages for his clients in The US, Europe and Asia.

He also helps journalists more effectively use computers to conduct
online research through automation and by describing where and how to
find otherwise hidden online information. No stranger to Europe--he's
lived and worked for clients in Moscow and Madrid, Mike taught at the
2008 European Investigative Journalism Conference (Brussels Belgium),
twice in 2009 he lectured at The Center for Investigative Journalism
(London England) and later in 2009, he lead several sessions at the VVOJ

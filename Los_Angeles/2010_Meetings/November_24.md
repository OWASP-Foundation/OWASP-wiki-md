attributes that drive Web application adoption – openness, transparency,
and ubiquity – also represent severe risk to the businesses that use
them.

## Abstract: Baking It In: Abuse-Resistant Web Applications

Current solutions for securing Web applications at run-time rely heavily
on signatures to identify and respond to threats. But signatures have
become less effective at detecting threats over time, and aren’t
sufficient to address the sophisticated abusive behavior that large,
publicly exposed Web applications are subject to, including page
scraping, logic abuse, malicious automation, phishing, and malware
distribution.


The key shortcoming is a lack of application context – without any
grounding in actual application and user behavior, signature-based
solutions can’t avoid flagging many false positives. This makes the
information they provide to administrators practically un-actionable.


In response, new approaches are emerging that focus on behavior, not
input signatures. One key trend is to enhance the application code
itself with detection points that provide more transparency into
malicious user behavior. This enables administrators to prevent
application abuse before bad users can establish an attack vector. In
this presentation, we’ll discuss the merits and challenges of this
approach. We’ll focus on specific examples, including the OWASP
AppSensor project and the Mykonos Security Appliance.

[**Mykonos Software**](http://Www.MykonosSoftware.com) approaches Web
application security differently. We understand how Web applications are
abused by criminal attackers to steal data, commit fraud, or use company
IP for un-intended tasks.
The Mykonos Security Appliance detects malicious abuse of web
applications before the damage is done. This software solution profiles
the abuse through intelligence gathering and responds to any abuse in
real-time ultimately preventing data theft, fraudulent behavior and
misuse of your Web properties.

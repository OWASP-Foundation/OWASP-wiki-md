## Abstract: How I Met Your Girlfriend: Entirely New Classes of Web Attacks

This includes using HTML5 client-side XSS (without XSS hitting the
server\!), and my newly discovered attacks on PHP session hijacking and
random numbers (accurately guessing PHP session cookies), browser
protocol confusion (turning a browser into an SMTP server), firewall and
NAT penetration via Javascript (turning your router against you), remote
iPhone Google Maps hijacking (iPhone penetration combined with HTTP
man-in-the-middle), extracting extremely accurate geolocation
information from a web browser (not using IP geolocation), and more.

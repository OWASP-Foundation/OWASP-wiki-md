## Abstract: OWASP Top 10 and Enterprise Security API (ESAPI)

The OWASP Top 10 project gives developers a short list of the most
dangerous mistakes they can make when developing web applications. The
OWASP Enterprise Security API or ESAPI tries to provide a structure and
tools to help mitigate these threats. In this talk, I will go over the
ESAPI project in general and drill down into the ESAPI for Java and how
this project can help mitigate the Top 10.

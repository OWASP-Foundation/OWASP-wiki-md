<p>The purpose of this project is to simply provide an objective list of important set of questions companies should utilize when they issue a Request For Proposal for Web Application Security Projects.</p>
<p>A Request For Proposal, (RFP) is a call made by an organization soliciting for bids by service providers or vendors to meet a need and it is often done by documents.</p>
<p>The information provided in RFPs are important and when you create an RFP for an Application Security Verification project , emphasis should be on providing clear information about the scope of verification activities and evaluation criteria so prospective service providers and vendors can submit proposals that are comparable.</p>
<p>You also need to provide adequate background information about the company soliciting for bids and other relevant information that can ensure that the project life cycle is successful. Also it is important that prospective service providers or vendors provide detailed information that helps the client to make an informed decision on who is the best fit for the project.</p>
<p>Usually this information may include standard questions such as proposed Application Security Verification Methodologies for defined tasks, relevant project experience etc. Others may include Security Coverage, Risk Evaluation Process , Reporting Techniques etc.</p>
<p>We outline in subsequent sections detailed information that should be provided for each application that is subject to verification in an Application Security Verification project.</p>

#### Project Details

[<http://www.owasp.org/images/7/71/Proactiverisk.jpg>](http://www.proactiverisk.com)

__NOTOC__ <headertabs />

#### Main

The information in this document will help you to create a standard ,
detailed RFP for Application Security Verification projects that service
providers or vendors can work with to submit relevant comparable
proposals for an organization.

__TOC__

# Application Security Verification.

## Recommended Information the Client (your Organization) should provide to Service Providers/Vendors.

1\. **Lines of code.** Lines of Code (LOC) or sometimes referred to as
Source Lines of Code (SLOC) is a prerequisite for any verification task
that involves the review of source code. This software metric (LOC)
provides information about the scale of the program under review. There
are software packages on the public domain such as LocMetrics on
<http://locmetrics.com> or CLOC on <http://cloc.sourceforge.net/> which
can be used to count the number of lines of code. Additional information
about LOC such as if the count included commented source code or not is
also beneficial

2\.**Number of dynamic pages.** Information about the number of dynamic
pages is advisable as it provides insights about the scale of the
application under assessment. It is important for verification efforts
that involved manual penetration testing. When estimating the amount of
dynamic pages , pay attention to pages with unique functionality or
purpose. If you have urls like:
i. /display_results.php?rs=1 ,
ii. /display_results.php?rs=2 ,
iii./display_results.php?rs=3 ,
you need to ensure that you confirm if they refer to a single unique
dynamic page or not

3\. **An Inventory of user roles and role descriptions.** The catalog of
user roles is endorsed for all verification efforts as it furnishes
business context for vulnerabilities (if any) established.

4\. **Brief Application Summary and Application architecture.** This is
mission critical for applications with non-standard architectures such
as those using thick clients, web services or integration with legacy
systems but not so paramount for applications with a standard web
application architecture (web server, application server, database
server setup).

5\.**Degree of verification expected .** To manage or prevent suppliers
providing erratic bids that vary in figures or timelines ,There is a
need to provide definitive guidance on the level of verification
desired. This should include requirements for or on:
a. Dynamic vulnerability scanning.
b. Manual code review.
c. Manual penetration testing.
d. Static analysis.
e. Security architecture review.
f. Malicious code analysis.
g. Threat modeling.

6\. **The frequency or duration for performing verification.** It is
important to indicate if you want a single verification exercise or if
you want several many verification exercises executed within a specified
time-frame.

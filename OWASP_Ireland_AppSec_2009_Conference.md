Welcome to the Irish OWASP Application Security Conference\!
After successful OWASP Conferences in the United States, Europe and
Asia, its Ireland's turn on September 10, 2009\!

**September 10th 2009**: OWASP will hold its first Irish Application
Security conference in historic Dublin University, Trinity College,
Dublin, Ireland. The conference consists of an intensive day of
talks/presentations and discussion with 2 different tracks focusing on
the causes and trends in web application insecurity.

**Training:** We are also offering our first web application security
training course, the Foundations of Web Application Security, the day
prior to the conference (**Sept. 9th**). See [below for more
details](OWASP_Ireland_AppSec_2009_Conference#Training "wikilink").

# Event Sponsorship

OWASP is providing sponsors exclusive access to its audience in Dublin,
Ireland through a limited number of Expo floor slots, providing a
focused setting for potential customers. The conference is expected to
draw 150 - 200 technologists who will be looking for ways to spend their
remaining 2009 budget and planning for 2010. Financial Services, Media,
Pharmaceuticals, Government, Healthcare, Technology, and many other
verticals will be represented.
Sponsorship details are available here: ![Sponsorship
deck](Dublin_Sponsorship_Form.pdf "Sponsorship deck")

# Training

We intend to hold some application security training on the 9/09/2009
the day prior to the event.
**This can be booked when booking a ticket to the event.
Fee: €450**

**Foundations of Web Application Security**

**Trainer: [Dave Wichers](User:Wichers "wikilink"), COO Aspect Security,
OWASP Board Member**

**Abstract**
Most developers, IT professionals, and auditors learn what they know
about application security on the job, usually by making mistakes.
Application security is just not a part of many computer science
curricula today and most organizations have not focused on instituting a
culture that includes application security as a core part of their IT
security efforts. This powerful one day course focuses on the most
common web application security problems, including the OWASP Top Ten.
The course will introduce and demonstrate hacking techniques,
illustrating how application vulnerabilities can be exploited so
students really understand how to avoid introducing such vulnerabilities
in their code.

This course includes coverage of the following common vulnerability
areas (the [OWASP Top 10](Top10 "wikilink")):

A1 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

A2 - Injection Flaws

A3 - Malicious File Execution

A4 - Insecure Direct Object Reference

A5 - Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

A6 - Information Leakage and Improper Error Handling

A7 - Broken Authentication and Session Management

A8 - Insecure Cryptographic Storage

A9 - Insecure Communications

A10 - Failure to Restrict URL Access

**Hands on**

To cement the principles discussed, students can participate in a number
of hands-on security testing exercises where they attack a live web
application (i.e., WebGoat) that has been seeded with common web
application vulnerabilities. The students will use proxy tools commonly
used by the hacker community to complete the exercises. Students need to
bring their own windows based laptop to participate in the exercises.

**Audience**

Developers who want to understand the most common web application
security flaws, and how to avoid them.

**Level**

Intermediate

**Prerequisite**

Basic knowledge of a web programming language like Java or .NET
recommended but not required.

Bringing your own windows based laptop is recommended so you can
participate in the hands on exercises.

**Duration**

Full day

### PROGRAM

The agenda:

  - 18h00 - 18h30: Welcome & Sandwiches
  - 18h30 - 18h45: **OWASP Update** (by Sebastien Deleersnyder, SAIT
    Zenitel, OWASP Board)
  - 18h45 - 19h45: **The [OWASP AppSensor
    Project](OWASP_AppSensor_Project "wikilink")** (by Colin Watson,
    Watson Hall Ltd)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    The [OWASP AppSensor Project](OWASP_AppSensor_Project "wikilink")
    defines a conceptual framework and methodology that offers
    prescriptive guidance to implement attack detection and automated
    response into an existing application. The talk will provide an
    overview why conventional defences do not work, and how
    application-specific detection can be used to identify, and respond
    to, attackers before they are able to find a flaw to exploit.
    Implementations will be described that have been tested against
    security scanning tools, manual attackers and how the technique
    could be used to defend against an application worm.
    **[Colin Watson](:User:Clerkendweller "wikilink")** is co-founder of
    [Watson Hall Ltd](https://www.watsonhall.com/), based in London,
    where his work involves the management of application risk,
    designing defensive measures, building security & privacy in to
    systems development and keeping abreast of relevant international
    legislation and standards. He holds a BSc in Chemical Engineering
    from Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, and an MSc in Computation
    from the University of Oxford. He contributes to a number of OWASP
    projects and is a member of the OWASP Global Industry Committee.

  - 19h45 - 20h00: Break
  - 20h00 - 21h00: **How to become Twitter's admin: An introduction to
    Modern Web Service Attacks** (by Andreas Falkenberg, RUB)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    Web Services are the cornerstone of inter-application communication
    in today's IT infrastructure. They are used in distributed systems
    ranging from huge B2B applications to Cloud APIs (e.g. Amazon EC2).
    Despite their wide usage, even in critical infrastructures, Web
    Service security is not fully understood yet. In addition to
    "classic" web application attacks, such as SQLi and XSS, the use of
    Web Services opens a whole new realm of attack vectors not found
    anywhere else.
    This talk will give an introduction to current attack techniques for
    Web Services that have been found in today's Web Services
    implementation stacks. As a hands on example, the attack technique
    of the "XML Signature Wrapping" attack is explained in detail. This
    attack enables an attacker to arbitrarily modify the content of a
    signed SOAP message with almost no effort.
    Based on the XML Signature Wrapping attack, an attack scenario is
    shown that enables an attacker to become admin of the famous Twitter
    service, based on a real-life XML Signature Wrapping Attack
    performed by researchers at our university in 2010.
    The last part of the talk gives an overview of other Web Service
    specific attacks and countermeasures, based on the information given
    at the WS-Attacks.org website.
    **Andreas** is currently seeking a Master's degree in IT Security at
    the Ruhr University of Bochum, Germany. Besides being busy writing
    exams, Andreas works for the Chair for Network- and Data-Security
    having fun with Cloud- and Web Service-Security.

  - 19h45 - 20h30: **[The Ghost of XSS Past, Present and Future – A
    Defensive
    Tale](https://www.owasp.org/images/f/f4/Future_of_XSS_v4.pptx)** (by
    Jim Manico, Infrared Security)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    This talk will discuss the past methods used for XSS defense that
    were only partially effective. Learning from these lessons, will
    will also discuss present day defensive methodologies that are
    effective, but place an undue burden on the developer. We will then
    finish with a discussion of future XSS defense mythologies that
    shift the burden of XSS defense from the developer to various
    frameworks. These include auto-escaping template technologies,
    browser-based defenses such as Content Security Policy, and
    Javascript sandboxes such as the Google CAJA project and JSReg.
    **[Jim Manico](:User:Jmanico "wikilink")** is a managing partner of
    Infrared Security with over 15 years of professional web development

    “Everything we think of as a computer today is really just a device
    that connects to the big computer that we are all collectively
    building"-Tim O'Reilly
    My friend Chris Hoff asked this question in a recent podcast - "why
    is the OWASP Top Ten the same year after year? why don't these
    things gets fixed?"\[1\]. The reason is that software security and
    security architecture and design is nowhere near as a high priority
    as it needs to be.
    If you look at the evolution of software over the years, you will
    see a history of more and more systems and data being connected
    together. Beginning with the Web through to component based
    application and then to Web services, at each step the common theme
    is more connectivity, more integration. Software is a rapidly
    changing universe
    Unfortunately, Information Security has not kept up. Our field
    started out promisingly in the mid-90s with network firewalls and
    SSL for security mechanisms to defend websites, but that is about as
    far it got. In 1999 when SOAP emerged as a firewall-friendly
    protocol designed for the explicit reason to go through the
    firewall, that should have been a wake up call to Information
    Security that the "firewall + SSL" security architecture was past
    its prime, but here 10 years later we are still hitting the snooze
    button.
    My view is that as technology is deployed we need security
    mechanisms that form fit to those new technologies, instead what we
    have is security technologies that form fit to auditor's excel
    spreadsheets.

  - 19h45 - 20h00: Break
  - 20h00 - 21h30: **Threat modeling** (by John Steven, Cigital)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    How will attackers break your web application? How much security
    testing is enough? Do I have to worry about insiders? Threat
    modeling, applied with a risk management approach can answer both of
    these questions if done correctly. This talk will present advanced
    threat modeling step-wise through examples and exercises using the
    Java EE platform and focusing on authentication, authorization, and
    session management. Participants will learn, through interactive
    exercise on real software architectures, how to use diagramming
    techniques to explicitly document threats their applications face,
    identify how assets worth protecting manifest themselves within the
    system, and enumerate the attack vectors these threats take
    advantage of. Participants will then engage in secure design
    activities, learning how to use the threat model to specify
    compensating controls for specified attack vectors. Finally, we'll
    discuss how the model can drive security testing and validate an
    application resists specified attack.

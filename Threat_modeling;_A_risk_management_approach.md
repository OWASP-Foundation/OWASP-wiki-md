Threat modeling, applied with a risk management approach answers
questions about who will attack your system and how. If done correctly,
it sets the context for answering questions about "how much security is
enough". This talk will present advanced threat modeling step-wise using
the Java EE platform and will focusing on authentication, authorization,
and session management. Participants will learn how to use diagramming
techniques to explicitly document threats their applications face,
identify how assets worth protecting manifest themselves within the
system, and enumerate the attack vectors these threats take advantage
of. This talk will focus on teach security professionals
software/application design techniques that will gain them greater
insight into common web attacks (and why controls often applied simply
don't affect the application's security), as well as giving models the
ability to get beyond common attacks into those which, while
high-impact, are often ignored.

This presentation demonstrates how important application security is to
the overall stability and security of the infrastructure and the
ultimately, the business. Presented from the Information Security
Officer/Risk Manager point of view, it shows how a strong information
security program reduces levels of reputational, operational, legal, and
strategic risk by limiting vulnerabilities, increasing stability, and
maintaining customer confidence and trust. It focuses on the top
concerns of risk managers and how application security fits into the
overall risk management process. The audience will be given
recommendations on how to improve cost effectiveness and efficiency to
achieve business, security, audit, and compliance objectives relative to
applications.

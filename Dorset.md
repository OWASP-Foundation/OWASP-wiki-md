With a real life case study, we'll be exploring three analysis tools -
Cyber Kill Chains, Diamond Models and the Intelligence cycle. David will
show how you can use these tools to understand what your adversary is
actually doing, how close to 'the Crown Jewels' they've got, how to find
their identity, their attributes and most importantly of all, what you
can do to stop them.

#### SPEAKERS:

**David P - Cyber Threat Intelligence Analyst** - Trained in the Royal
Corps of Signals, David went onto Microsoft and then ICL (Fujitsu) as a

investment.

  - **[I know what you did last summer: New persistent tracking
    mechanisms used in the wild" - Dr. Alexios
    Mylonas](https://www.owasp.org/images/c/ca/OWASP_Dorset_Chapter_Meeting_Jan_2019_Talk_2_Web_Tracking.pdf)**Â 

<!-- end list -->

  -
    Web Storage, Indexed Database API and Web SQL Database allow web
    browsers to store information in the client in a much more advanced
    way compared to other techniques, such as HTTP Cookies. They were
    originally introduced with the goal of enhancing the capabilities of
    websites, however, they are often exploited as a way of tracking
    users across multiple sessions and websites. The presentation will
    be divided into two parts. First, it will quantify the usage of
    these three primitives in the context of user tracking. This is done
    by performing a large-scale analysis on the usage of these
    techniques in the wild. The second part reviews the effectiveness of
    the removal of client-side storage data in modern browsers.

Diamond Models and the Intelligence cycle. David will show how you can

close to 'the Crown Jewels' they've got, how to find their identity,
their attributes and most importantly of all, what you can do to stop
them.

    Dorset Chapter Leader.

  -
    Overview of OWASP Projects Top 3 Flagship, Lab and Incubator |

##### \***[I know what you did last summer: New persistent tracking mechanisms used in the wild](https://www.owasp.org/images/c/ca/OWASP_Dorset_Chapter_Meeting_Jan_2019_Talk_2_Web_Tracking.pdf)**

  -
    Web Storage, Indexed Database API and Web SQL Database allow web
    browsers to store information in the client in a much more advanced
    way compared to other techniques, such as HTTP Cookies. They were
    originally introduced with the goal of enhancing the capabilities of
    websites, however, they are often exploited as a way of tracking
    users across multiple sessions and websites. The presentation will
    be divided into two parts. First, it will quantify the usage of
    these three primitives in the context of user tracking. This is done
    by performing a large-scale analysis on the usage of these
    techniques in the wild. The second part reviews the effectiveness of
    the removal of client-side storage data in modern browsers.

## Rules for inclusion in OWASP Member Offers list

If you would like to extend an offer that is of benefit to the members
of OWASP, please [contact us](http://owasp4.owasp.org/contactus.html).
Before you do, here are the current rules we follow for maintaining this
list:

Offers will only be listed if they meet the following criteria:

1.  The discount or offer has to be related to the interests of the
    OWASP community
2.  The discount or offer has to be in addition to any discounts or
    offers that are already available to the general public
3.  Such discounts will only be listed if they provide both a
    significant benefit to OWASP members AND a significant benefit to
    the OWASP Foundation.

Significant benefit to the OWASP Foundation includes the offering
organization being a Corporate Member of OWASP or some other benefit
negotiated between the offerer and the OWASP Foundation.

  - Such discounts or offers will NOT be advertised or described
    anywhere else on the OWASP site, nor will they be individually
    promoted via any of the OWASP mailing lists.
  - The OWASP Foundation may periodically promote the collective set of
    OWASP Member discounts or offers as needed.

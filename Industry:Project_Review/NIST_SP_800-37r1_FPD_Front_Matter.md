The Information Technology Laboratory
([ITL](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:ITL)) at the [National
Institute of Standards and
Technology](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology)
(NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing
technical leadership for the nation's measurement and standards
infrastructure. [ITL](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:ITL)
develops tests, test methods, [reference
data](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Reference_Data), proof
of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance the
development and productive use of information technology. ITL's
responsibilities include the development of management, administrative,
technical, and physical standards and guidelines for the cost-effective
security and privacy of other than [national security-related
information](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:National_Security-Related_Information)
in federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series
reports on ITL's research, guidelines, and outreach efforts in
information system security, and its collaborative activities with
industry, government, and academic organizations.

## Authority

</center>

This publication has been developed by NIST to further its statutory
responsibilities under the [Federal Information Security Management
Act](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:Federal_Information_Security_Management_Act)
(FISMA), Public Law (\[<http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:P.L>.
P.L.\]) 107-347. NIST is responsible for developing information security
standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements for federal
information systems, but such standards and guidelines shall not apply
to [national security
systems](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:National_Security_Systems)
without the express approval of appropriate federal officials exercising
policy authority over such systems. This guideline is consistent with
the requirements of the [Office of Management and
Budget](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Office_of_Management_and_Budget)
(OMB) [Circular
A-130](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:Circular_A-130),
Section 8b(3), Securing Agency Information Systems, as analyzed in
[Circular
A-130](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:Circular_A-130),
Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental information is
provided in [Circular
A-130](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:Circular_A-130),
Appendix III.

Nothing in this publication should be taken to contradict the standards
and guidelines made mandatory and binding on federal agencies by the
[Secretary of
Commerce](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Secretary_of_Commerce)
under statutory authority. Nor should these guidelines be interpreted as
altering or superseding the existing authorities of the [Secretary of
Commerce](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Secretary_of_Commerce),
Director of the OMB, or any other federal official. This publication may
be used by nongovernmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not
subject to copyright in the [United
States](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:United_States).
Attribution would, however, be appreciated by NIST.

## Compliance with NIST Standards and Guidelines

</center>

In accordance with the provisions of FISMA,\[1\] the [Secretary of
Commerce](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Secretary_of_Commerce)
shall, on the basis of standards and guidelines developed by NIST,
prescribe standards and guidelines pertaining to federal information
systems. The Secretary shall make standards compulsory and binding to
the extent determined necessary by the Secretary to improve the
efficiency of operation or security of federal information systems.
Standards prescribed shall include information security standards that
provide minimum information [security
requirements](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Requirements)
and are otherwise necessary to improve the security of federal
information and information systems.

  - [Federal Information Processing
    Standards](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Federal_Information_Processing_Standards)
    (FIPS) are approved by the [Secretary of
    Commerce](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Secretary_of_Commerce)
    and issued by NIST in accordance with FISMA. FIPS are compulsory and
    binding for federal agencies.\[2\] FISMA requires that federal
    agencies comply with these standards, and therefore, agencies may
    not waive their use.
  - Special Publications (SPs) are developed and issued by NIST as
    recommendations and guidance documents. For other than [national
    security](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:National_Security)
    programs and systems, federal agencies must follow those NIST
    Special Publications mandated in a [Federal Information Processing
    Standard](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Federal_Information_Processing_Standard).
    [FIPS 200](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:FIPS_200)
    mandates the use of [Special
    Publication 800-53](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:Special_Publication_800-53),
    as amended. In addition, OMB policies (including OMB
    [Reporting](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Reporting)
    Instructions for FISMA and Agency Privacy Management) state that for
    other than [national
    security](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:National_Security)
    programs and systems, federal agencies must follow certain specific
    NIST Special Publications.\[3\]
  - Other security-related publications, including interagency reports
    (NISTIRs) and [ITL](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:ITL)
    Bulletins, provide technical and other information about NIST's
    activities. These publications are mandatory only when specified by
    OMB.
  - Compliance schedules for NIST security standards and guidelines are
    established by OMB.

## Notes to Reviewers

</center>

NIST [Special
Publication 800-37](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:Special_Publication_800-37),
Revision 1, represents the second in a series of publications being
developed by the Joint Task Force Transformation Initiative. For the
past three years, NIST has been working in partnership with the Office
of the Director of [National
Intelligence](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:National_Intelligence)
([ODNI](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:ODNI)), the
[Department of
Defense](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Department_of_Defense)
([DOD](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:DOD)), and the
Committee on [National Security
Systems](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:National_Security_Systems)
([CNSS](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:CNSS)) to develop a
common information security framework for the federal government and its
support contractors. The initial publication produced by the task force,
[NIST Special
Publication 800-53](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:NIST_Special_Publication_800-53),
Revision 3, was historic in nature—in that it created a unified security
control catalog reflecting the information [security
requirements](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Requirements)
of both the [national
security](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:National_Security)
community and the nonnational security community. [NIST Special
Publication 800-37](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:NIST_Special_Publication_800-37),
Revision 1, continues the transformation by significantly changing the
traditional process employed by the federal government to certify and
accredit federal information systems. The revised process provides
greater emphasis on: (i) building information security capabilities into
information systems through the application of state-of-the-practice
management, operational, and [technical
security](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Technical_Security)
controls; (ii) maintaining awareness of the security state of
information systems on an ongoing basis though enhanced monitoring
processes; and (iii) understanding and accepting the risk to
organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations,
and the Nation arising from the use of information systems.

The most significant change in the Final Public Draft of [Special
Publication 800-37](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:Special_Publication_800-37),
Revision 1, is the full transformation of the [Certification and
Accreditation](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Certification_and_Accreditation)
(C\&A) process into the six-step [Risk
Management](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management)
Framework ([RMF](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:RMF)). The
revised [RMF](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:RMF)-based
process has the following characteristics:

  - Integrates information security more closely into the [enterprise
    architecture](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Enterprise_Architecture)
    and [system development life
    cycle](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:System_Development_Life_Cycle);
  - Provides equal emphasis on the selection, implementation,
    [assessment](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment),
    and monitoring of [security
    controls](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls),
    and the authorization of information systems;
  - Establishes responsibility and
    [accountability](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Accountability)
    for [security
    controls](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls)
    deployed within organizational information systems and inherited by
    those systems (i.e., common controls);
  - Links [risk
    management](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management)
    processes at the information [system
    level](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:System_Level) to
    [risk
    management](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management)
    processes at the organization-level through a [risk executive
    (function)](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Executive_\(Function\));
  - Promotes the concept of near
    [real-time](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Real-Time)
    [risk
    management](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management)
    and ongoing information system authorization through the
    implementation of robust continuous monitoring processes; and
  - Encourages the use of automation and automated support tools to
    provide senior leaders the necessary information to take credible,
    risk-based decisions with regard to the organizational information
    systems supporting their core missions and business functions.

The [risk
management](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management)
process described in this publication changes the traditional focus from
the stovepipe, organization-centric, static-based approaches to C\&A and
provides the capability to more effectively manage [information
system-related security
risks](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System-related_Security_Risks)
in highly dynamic environments of complex and sophisticated cyber
threats, ever increasing system vulnerabilities, and rapidly changing
missions.

We have worked diligently to review and adjudicate the over five hundred
comments received during the initial public review process. Your
feedback to us, as always, is important. We appreciate each and every
contribution from our reviewers. The very insightful comments from both
the public and private sectors continue to help shape our publications
and ensure that they meet the needs of our customers.

    ([P.L. 107-347](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:P.L._107-347))

    entitled the [Federal Information Security Management
    Act](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:Federal_Information_Security_Management_Act)

    the information systems that support its operations and assets.
2.  The term agency is used in this publication in lieu of the more
    general term organization only in those circumstances where its
    usage is directly related to other source documents such as federal
    legislation or policy.
3.  While federal agencies are required to follow certain specific NIST
    Special Publications in accordance with OMB policy, there is
    flexibility in how agencies apply the guidance. Federal agencies
    should apply the security concepts and principles articulated in the
    NIST Special Publications in accordance with and in the context of
    the agency's missions, business functions, and environment of
    operation. Consequently, the application of NIST guidance by federal
    agencies can result in different security solutions that are equally
    acceptable, compliant with the guidance, and meet the OMB definition
    of [adequate
    security](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Adequate_Security)
    for federal information systems. When assessing [federal
    agency](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Federal_Agency)
    compliance with NIST Special Publications, Inspectors General,
    evaluators, auditors, and assessors should consider the intent of
    the security concepts and principles articulated within the specific
    guidance document and how the agency applied the guidance in the
    context of its mission/business responsibilities, [operational
    environment](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Operational_Environment),
    and unique organizational conditions.

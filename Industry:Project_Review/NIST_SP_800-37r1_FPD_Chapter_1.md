THE NEED FOR MANAGING [INFORMATION SYSTEM-RELATED SECURITY
RISKS](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System-related_Security_Risks)

Organizations\[1\] depend on information technology and the information
systems\[2\] that are developed from that technology to successfully
carry out their missions and business functions. Information systems can
include a range of diverse computing platforms from high-end
supercomputers to personal digital assistants and cellular telephones.
Information systems can also include very specialized systems and
devices (e.g., [telecommunications
systems](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Telecommunications_Systems),
industrial/process control systems, testing and calibration devices,
weapons systems, [command and
control](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Command_and_Control)
systems, and environmental control systems). Federal information
systems\[3\] are subject to serious *threats* that can have adverse
impacts\[4\] on organizational operations (including mission, functions,
image, and reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other
organizations, and the Nation by compromising the confidentiality,
integrity, or availability of information being processed, stored, or
transmitted by those systems. Threats to information systems include
environmental disruptions, human or machine errors, and purposeful
attacks. Cyber attacks on information systems today are often
aggressive, disciplined, well-organized, well-funded, and in a growing
number of documented cases, very sophisticated. Successful attacks on
public and private sector information systems can result in great harm
to the national and economic security interests of the [United
States](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:United_States). Given
the significant and growing danger of these threats, it is imperative
that leaders at all levels understand their responsibilities for
achieving adequate information security\[5\] and for managing
[information system-related security
risks](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System-related_Security_Risks).\[6\]

## 1.1 BACKGROUND

NIST in partnership with the [Department of
Defense](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Department_of_Defense)
([DOD](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:DOD)), the Office of
the Director of [National
Intelligence](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:National_Intelligence)
([ODNI](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:ODNI)), and the
Committee on [National Security
Systems](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:National_Security_Systems)
([CNSS](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:CNSS)), is developing
a common information security framework for the federal government and
its support contractors. This publication represents the second in a
series of publications developed by the Joint Task Force Transformation
Initiative. The initial publication produced by the joint task force,
[NIST Special
Publication 800-53](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:NIST_Special_Publication_800-53),
Revision 3, created a unified security control catalog reflecting the
information [security
requirements](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Requirements)
of both the [national
security](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:National_Security)
community and the nonnational security community. [NIST Special
Publication 800-37](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:NIST_Special_Publication_800-37),
Revision 1, continues the evolution to a unified framework by
transforming the traditional [Certification and
Accreditation](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Certification_and_Accreditation)
(C\&A) process into the six-step [Risk
Management](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management)
Framework ([RMF](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:RMF)). The
revised process emphasizes: (i) building information security
capabilities into federal information systems through the application of
state-of-the-practice management, operational, and [technical
security](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Technical_Security)
controls; (ii) maintaining awareness of the security state of
information systems on an ongoing basis though enhanced monitoring
processes; and (iii) providing essential information to senior leaders
to facilitate credible decisions regarding the
[acceptance](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Acceptance) of
risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other
organizations, and the Nation arising from the operation and use of
information systems.

The [RMF](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:RMF)-based process
has the following characteristics:

  - Promotes the concept of near
    [real-time](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Real-Time)
    [risk
    management](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management)
    and ongoing information system authorization through the
    implementation of robust continuous monitoring processes;
  - Encourages the use of automation and automated support tools to
    provide senior leaders the necessary information to take credible,
    risk-based decisions with regard to the organizational information
    systems supporting their core missions and business functions;
  - Integrates information security more closely into the [enterprise
    architecture](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Enterprise_Architecture)
    and [system development life
    cycle](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:System_Development_Life_Cycle);
  - Provides equal emphasis on the selection, implementation,
    [assessment](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Assessment),
    and monitoring of [security
    controls](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls),
    and the authorization of information systems;
  - Links [risk
    management](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management)
    processes at the information [system
    level](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:System_Level) to
    [risk
    management](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management)
    processes at the organization level through a [risk executive
    (function)](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Executive_\(Function\));
    and
  - Establishes responsibility and
    [accountability](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Accountability)
    for [security
    controls](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls)
    deployed within organizational information systems and inherited by
    those systems (i.e., common controls).

The [risk
management](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management)
process described in this publication and in other supporting NIST
publications changes the traditional focus from the stove-pipe,
organization-centric, static-based approaches to C\&A and provides the
capability to more effectively manage [information system-related
security
risks](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_System-related_Security_Risks)
in highly dynamic environments of complex and sophisticated cyber
threats, ever increasing system vulnerabilities, and rapidly changing
missions.

## 1.2 PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY

The purpose of this publication is to provide guidelines for applying
the [Risk
Management](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Management)
Framework to federal information systems to include conducting the
activities of [security
categorization](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Categorization),\[7\]
security control selection and implementation, [security control
assessment](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Control_Assessment),
information system authorization,\[8\] and security control monitoring.
The guidelines have been developed:

  - To ensure that managing risk from the operation and use of federal
    information systems is consistent with the organization's
    mission/business objectives and overall risk strategy established by
    the senior leadership through the [risk executive
    (function)](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Executive_\(Function\));
  - To ensure that information [security
    requirements](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Requirements),
    including necessary [security
    controls](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls),
    are integrated into the organization's [enterprise
    architecture](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Enterprise_Architecture)
    and [system development life
    cycle](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:System_Development_Life_Cycle)
    processes;
  - To support consistent, well-informed, and ongoing [security
    authorization](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Authorization)
    decisions (through continuous monitoring), transparency of security
    and risk-related information, and
    [reciprocity](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Reciprocity)
    of authorization results;\[9\] and
  - To achieve more secure information and information systems within
    the federal government through the implementation of appropriate
    [risk
    mitigation](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Risk_Mitigation)
    strategies.

This publication satisfies the requirements of the [Act|Federal
Information Security Management
Act](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:Federal_Information_Security_Management)
(FISMA) and meets or exceeds the information [security
requirements](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Requirements)
established for executive agencies\[10\] by the [Office of Management
and
Budget](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Office_of_Management_and_Budget)
(OMB) in [Circular
A-130](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:Circular_A-130),
Appendix III, *Security of Federal Automated Information Resources*. The
guidelines in this publication are applicable to all federal information
systems\[11\] other than those systems designated as [national security
systems](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:National_Security_Systems)
as defined in
\[<http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:44_U.S.C>.,_Section_3542
44 U.S.C., Section 3542\]. The guidelines have been broadly developed
from a technical perspective to complement similar guidelines for
[national security
systems](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:National_Security_Systems)
and may be used for such systems with the approval of appropriate
federal officials exercising policy authority over such systems. State,
local, and tribal governments, as well as private sector organizations
are encouraged to consider using these guidelines, as appropriate.\[12\]

1.  The term organization is used in this publication to describe an
    [entity](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Entity) of any
    size, complexity, or positioning within an organizational structure
    (e.g., a [federal
    agency](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Federal_Agency)
    or, as appropriate, any of its operational elements).
2.  An information system is a discrete set of [information
    resources](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Information_Resources)
    organized for the collection,
    [processing](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Processing),
    [maintenance](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Maintenance),
    use, sharing,
    [dissemination](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Dissemination),
    or
    [disposition](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Disposition)
    of information.
3.  A [federal information
    system](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Federal_Information_System)
    is defined as an information system used or operated by a [federal
    agency](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Federal_Agency),
    or by a
    [contractor](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Contractor)
    of a [federal
    agency](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Federal_Agency)
    or by another organization on behalf of a [federal
    agency](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Federal_Agency).
4.  Adverse impacts to the Nation include, for example, compromises to
    information systems that support critical infrastructure
    applications or are paramount to government continuity of operations
    as defined by the [Department of Homeland
    Security](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Department_of_Homeland_Security).
5.  OMB [Circular
    A-130](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:Circular_A-130),
    Appendix III, describes [adequate
    security](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Adequate_Security)
    as security commensurate with risk. This risk includes both the
    likelihood and magnitude of harm resulting from the loss, misuse, or
    [unauthorized
    access](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Unauthorized_Access)
    to or modification of information.
6.  Risk is a measure of the extent to which an
    [entity](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Entity) is
    threatened by a potential circumstance or event, and is typically a
    function of the likelihood of the circumstance or event occurring
    and of the resulting adverse impacts.
7.  Security categorization methodologies are described in [CNSS
    Instruction 1253](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:CNSS_Instruction_1253)
    for [national security
    systems](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:National_Security_Systems)
    and in
    [FIPS 199](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:FIPS_199) for
    other than [national security
    systems](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:National_Security_Systems).
8.  Security authorization is the official management decision given by
    a senior organizational official to authorize operation of an
    information system and to explicitly accept the risk to
    organizational operations and assets, individuals, other
    organizations, and the Nation based on the implementation of an
    agreed-upon set of [security
    controls](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Controls).
9.  Reciprocity of [security
    authorization](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Authorization)
    results is the mutual agreement among participating organizations to
    accept each other's security assessments in order to reuse
    information system resources and/or to accept each other's assessed
    security posture in order to share information.
    [Reciprocity](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Reciprocity)
    is best achieved by promoting the concept of transparency (i.e.,
    making sufficient evidence regarding the security state of an
    information system available, so that an [authorizing
    official](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Authorizing_Official)
    from another organization can use that evidence to make credible,
    risk-based decisions regarding the operation and use of that system
    or the information it processes, stores, or transmits).
10. An [executive
    agency](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Executive_Agency)
    is: (i) an executive department specified in
    \[<http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:5_U.S.C>.,_Section_101
    5 U.S.C., Section 101\]; (ii) a military department specified in
    \[<http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:5_U.S.C>.,_Section_102
    5 U.S.C., Section 102\]; (iii) an independent establishment as
    defined in
    \[<http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:5_U.S.C>.,_Section_104(1)
    5 U.S.C., Section 104(1)\]; and
    ([iv](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=AnA:IV)) a wholly owned
    government
    [corporation](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Corporation)
    fully subject to the provisions of
    \[<http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Doc:31_U.S.C>.,_Chapter_91
    31 U.S.C., Chapter 91\]. In this publication, the term [executive
    agency](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Executive_Agency)
    is synonymous with the term [federal
    agency](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Federal_Agency).
11. A [federal information
    system](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Federal_Information_System)
    is an information system used or operated by an [executive
    agency](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Executive_Agency),
    by a
    [contractor](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Contractor)
    of an [executive
    agency](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Executive_Agency),
    or by another organization on behalf of an [executive
    agency](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Executive_Agency).
12. Interconnection of federal information systems with information
    systems operated by state, local, and/or tribal governments requires
    the application of the information security standards and guidelines
    described in this publication. Information [security
    requirements](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Security_Requirements)
    and the terms and conditions of the system interconnections, are
    expressed in the Memorandums of Understanding and Interconnection
    Security Agreements established by participating organizations.
13. At the agency level, this position is known as the [Officer|Senior
    Agency Information Security
    Officer](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Senior_Agency_Information_Security).
    Organizations may also refer to this position as the [Chief
    Information Security
    Officer](http://fismapedia.org/index.php?title=Term:Chief_Information_Security_Officer).

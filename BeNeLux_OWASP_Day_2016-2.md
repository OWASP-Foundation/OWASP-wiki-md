## Trainings

### Breakers, defenders and superheroes\!

In the wonderful world of application security we often learn to break
stuff or we learn how to prevent hackers from breaking your stuff. In
this training i would love to adres some basic and advanced topics and
not only teach developers how to properly test their code like a
penetration tester, but also learn the penetration tester to think like
a developer so they really can deliver added value when instructing
developers on how to fix their code like a baws\!

Some of the topics i would like to adresss are:

  - Content security policy and how to defeat it with HTML injections
  - Advanced cross site scripting
  - Cross site request forgery
  - Mass Assignment (Parameter binding) attacks
  - External entity attacks
  - Path/directory traversal attacks (File inclusion attacks)
  - File upload injections
  - Server side template injections
  - Authentication and authorization

### PWN Android Apps with your Custom Built Toolbox

Frustrated with the various tools and environments needed to perform
mobile pentesting? All available Android test distributions have
drawbacks and missing and/or non-working tools etc. Learn how to create
your own customized mobile pentesting toolbox with the tools you really
want/need.

Not sure which steps to follow when performing a mobile application
security assessment? Our renowned trainer, Steven Wierckx, will show you
which steps to follow and what issues to focus on.

### Why simply deploying HTTPS will not get you an A+ grade

20 years after the introduction of HTTPS, it is finally moving towards
widespread adoption. As more and more web sites are enabling HTTPS, the
attention for correct deployments increases as well. Tools such as
Qualys’ SSL Labs server test make it is easy to verify the quality of
any domain’s HTTPS deployment, but at the same time show how challenging
it is to receive an A+ grade. While the initial deployment of HTTPS may
seem straightforward, correctly deploying HTTPS is a daunting task. In
this session, participants will learn through hands-on experience how to
deploy HTTPS correctly, and how it impacts a Web application. We will
cover common Web attacks on HTTPS, and how they are countered by the
newest HTTPS security policies, such as HTTP Strict Transport Security
(HSTS) and HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP).

The learning objectives for this session are:

  - Learning how to deploy HTTPS correctly, with strong ciphers and
    forward secrecy
  - Understanding the intricacies of HTTPS, and its impact on a Web
    application, especially in combination with HTTP
  - Understanding common Web attacks against HTTPS, and the newest
    browser-enforced security policies that counter them

## Talks

### The State of Security of WordPress (plugins)

Last July, we organised the Summer of Pwnage (sumofpwn.nl) targeting
WordPress and WordPress Plugins. This has resulted in 118 findings;
mostly affecting WordPress Plugins, but also WordPress Core. Looking at
the reported types of vulnerabilities, by far the most reported type is
Cross-Site Scripting. The majority of Cross-Site Scripting
vulnerabilities were of the reflected type where the victim has to click
on a malicious link or visit a malicious website (or advertisement). A
fair share of them were stored though, and some of them even pre-auth.

Does this mean that WordPress is inherently insecure or is it just the
Plugin eco system? In this talk, I'll present our view on the
(in)security of WordPress and WordPress Plugins. In addition, I'll show
how a WordPress installation can be compromised using Cross-Site
Scripting (and how to protect) and a generic way to get remote code
execution through PHP Object Injection will be demonstrated.

### Securing AngularJS Applications

Since its birth, the Web evolved from a system to share and view
scientific documents to a full-blown platform for sophisticated
applications. While in the beginning most Web applications were
implemented purely on the server-side, modern ones heavily rely on
client-side components.

AnuglarJS is the latest addition in this process. Within an Angular
application the server is merely a data storage facility with a few
additional access checks. The core of the application is running on the
client-side.

As Angular is specifically designed to work on the client-side, it
attempts to remove the main points of friction for developers. By
providing a templating system, two-way bindings and custom directives,
DOM interactions can be reduced to a bare minimum.

From a security point of view this is very interesting as Angular
removes the need for using some DOM APIs with very sharp edges
(innerHTML, document.write). On the other hand, Angular introduces new
ways of approaching application development that are largely unexplored
in terms of security.

This talk provides an in-depth introduction to the security of Angular
applications. It first introduces the core design ideas and security
principles of AngularJS. Then, based on the experience of the Google
Security Team, shows common security pitfalls that are specific to
Angular applications. In general, the talk covers Angular's string
interpolation functionality, strict auto-escaping templates, URL-based
directives and insecure legacy APIs. All the presented issues are based
on real-world bugs. The talk will demonstrate how to find and prevent
these issues in practice.

### Compression Bombs Strike Back

Network services often use data compression to reduce protocol message
size. However, if data compression is not properly implemented, it can
render entire applications vulnerable to DoS attacks. Abusing data
compression to exhaust system resources is an old trick. For example, a
zip bomb is a recursively highly-compressed file archive prepared with
the only goal of exhausting the resources of programs that attempt to
inspect its content. This attack was brought to the community attention
in 1996 to mount DoS attacks against bulletin board systems.

While this may now seem an old, unsophisticated, and easily avoidable
threat,we discovered that developers did not fully learn from prior
mistakes. We looked at three protocols (i.e., HTTP, XMPP, and IMAP) and
11 network services including popular ones (e.g., Apache HTTPD, Tomcat,
Prosody, and OpenFire) and discovered that the risks of supporting data
compression are still often overlooked.

In this talk, we will walk through data amplification attacks starting
from the ever-green zip bomb and xml bomb attacks until our recent
results. We will present the current use of data compression in several
popular protocol and network services, and 12 common mistakes that we
observed at the implementation, specification, and configuration levels.
In this talk, we will also present already patched resource exhaustion
vulnerabilities which could have been used to perform Denial of Service
attack against popular services.

### Closing Keynote: The Future of Security

Computers are still getting faster by factor of two every 18 months, and
the doubling time for memory and communications is even smaller. An
increasing number of experts is developing and deploying ever more
sophisticated security techniques. But cybersecurity incidents multiply
and are more prominent in the media. Will the cloud and the Internet of
Things offer us a secure infrastructure? Or are we heading for a
security and privacy nightmare? What is the role of governments,
companies and individuals? Do we need backdoors in security technologies
to balance privacy and security? This seminar tries to answer these
questions.

### Handling of Security Requirements in Software Development Lifecycle

The bigger the company you're working in, the more technologies and
methodologies used by development teams you are going to face. At the
same time, you want to address security risks in an appropriate,
reliable and traceable way for all of them.

After a short introduction of a unified process for handling security
requirements in a large company, the main part of the talk is going to
focus on a tool called SecurityRAT (Requirement Automation Tool) which
has been developed in order to support and accelerate this process. The
goal of the tool is first to provide a list of relevant security
requirements according to properties of the developed software, and
afterwards to handle these in a mostly automated way - integration with
an issue tracker being used as a core feature. Work in progress and
future plans will form the last part of the talk.

### Zap it \!

The OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is one of the world’s most popular and
best maintained free security tools. In this talk we will cover some of
the basic features of Zap and deep dive in some advanced features. We
will also cover the ways you can use ZAP in your applications SDL.

### Stealing Secrets through Browser-based Side-channel Attacks

Browsers are becoming increasingly more complex. New features are added
on a virtually daily basis in order to accomodate the most exotic use
cases, allow the millions of lines of JavaScript code to be executed
even faster, or provide the foundation for extremely accurate analytics.
Combined with the well-known security-principle that an increase in
functionality results in a larger attack surface, browsers are becoming
a more and more interesting target for adversaries. In this talk, we
will focus on a class of attacks that is often overlooked, namely
side-channel attacks. Among other things, we will explore the causes for
these newly discovered side-channel attacks, and how these can be
leveraged to extract sensitive information, such as CSRF tokens, from
web pages. Finally, we will analyse the various techniques that can be
used to defend against these attacks.

### Securing Android Applications

In this talk we will discuss the attack surfaces of an Android
application and some best practice security implementations specific for
Android applications. We will cover cryptography, code protection
techniques and network security implementations.

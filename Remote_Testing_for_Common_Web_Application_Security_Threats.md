\==Description== **Course Length: 2 Days**

The proliferation of web-based applications has increased the
enterprise's exposure to a variety of threats. There are overarching
steps that can and should be taken at various steps in the application's
lifecycle to prevent or mitigate these threats, such as implementing
secure design and coding practices, performing source code audits, and
maintaining proper audit trails to detect unauthorized use.

This workshop will enable students to test the security of web-based
applications from the perspective of the end user. Security testing
helps to fulfill industry best practices and validate implementation.
Security testing is especially useful since it can be done at various
phases within the application's lifecycle (e.g. during development), or
when source code is not available for review.

The most common threats and their potential impact will be covered
(based on the industry standard OWASP "Top Ten" – see
<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project>).
Hands-on labs and demonstrations will be used to teach the tools and
techniques needed to remotely detect and validate the presence of these
threats.

## Student Requirements

You will need to bring your own notebook computer. Each student will be
given a virtual machine containing open-source OS, tools, documentation,
and targets for a fully self-containing web app security testing
environment. Training will feature the open-source project “Web
Application Security Dojo” (http://dojo.mavensecurity.com)

Student systems should meet the following minimum requirements

1.  Prior to the workshop install the latest stable version of
    VirtualBox. (Free from [1](http://www.virtualbox.org/)). VirtualBox
    runs on almost any OS (sorry, no Amiga support).
2.  Your system should be updated with the latest security patches for
    your own protection if you opt to get on the classroom/conference
    network.
3.  If you use a Windows OS then the file system must be NTFS or better
    in order to handle large files. FAT32 will not work\! See
    [2](http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20071114114830AAOlJRN)
    for help determining which file system you have.
4.  Optional: Wifi network card. A network connection is not required
    because the virtual machine will contain the targets – however,
    Internet access is always handy.
5.  Optional: Student should have Administrator access to the OS in case
    they need to install new software during class. This will not be
    necessary once VirtualBox is installed. Again, be sure to have
    VirtualBox installed (step 1 above) before you arrive at class.
6.  Hard drive should have at least 5 GB of free space.
7.  1 GB of RAM (more is better); 2 GB of RAM if you are using Vista.
8.  Modern CPU (last 2-3 years); if you have 1+ GB of RAM you are
    probably fine.

## Objectives

Skill: Basic, Intermediate, Advanced

1.  Understand the security threats facing web applications.
2.  Learn the tools and techniques to remotely validate a web
    application's security.
3.  Enhance secure programming practices by raising awareness and giving
    developers and auditors the tools & knowledge needed to test their
    web application’s security from the user's perspective.
4.  Suggestions for mitigating security risks in web applications

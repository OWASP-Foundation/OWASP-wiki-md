This presentation will introduce the Data Privacy principles of the
European Data Protection Directive. One of these principles is security.
This simply means that applications and/or databases processing and
storing personal data (personally identifiable information) need to have
sufficient security controls applied in order to avoid unauthorised
access to, modifications to and deletions of personal data.

Consequently when designing a new (web) application, of which you know
that it will process and store personal data, it is important that a
number of questions are addressed. After all, as with information
security, it is better to include data privacy requirements from the
beginning than adding controls later on in the development phase. Hence
the presentation will show a way of adding a new questionnaire regarding
data privacy into the development life cycle.

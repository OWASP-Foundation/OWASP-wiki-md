**18:00 - 18:30 Check-In (catering included)**
**18:30 - 18:45 Introduction (OWASP organization, projects, sponsor)
**

**18.45 - 19.45 How OWASP resources can be used by universities to
develop, test and deploy secure web applications (Kuai Hinojosa)**
Universities are key to making application security visible and the need
to educate software developers about application security as an aspect
of proper software development has never been more important. In this
presentation I will share how OWASP resources can be used by
universities to develop, test and deploy secure web applications. I will
discuss challenges that Universities currently face integrating a
pplication security best practices, describe how OWASP tools and
resources are currently used at New York University to test for most
common web application flaws. I will introduce projects such as the
OWASP Enterprise Security API which can be used to mitigate most common
flaws in web applications and share initiatives the OWASP Global
Education Committee is currently working on. If you are interested in
securing web applications, and supporting the OWASP Global Education
Committee efforts you don't want to miss this\!

Kuai Hinojosa has been developing and securing web applications for
about 12 years. He previously worked in the banking industry as a
database security administrator for the 5th largest bank in the U.S.
where he worked in a small team developing applications that protected
company's assets. He now works for New York University as a Web
Applications Specialist where he continues to use web application
development and application security experience to protect university
resources. In his spare time Kuai volunteers his time preaching the
application security gospel and leading the Minneapolis OWASP chapter.
Kuai is a member of the OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project)
Global Education Committee.
**19.45 – 20.00 Break**

**20. 00 – 20.30 VAC REGEX Denial of Service Attacks** **(Adar Weidman,
Senior Developer Checkmarx Ltd.)**
([Media:20091210_VAC-REGEX_DOS-Adar_Weidman.pdf](Media:20091210_VAC-REGEX_DOS-Adar_Weidman.pdf "wikilink"))

This presentation explores the Regular Expression Denial of Service
(ReDoS) attack and how it be used in order to implement new and old
attacks. ReDoS is commonly known as a “bug” in systems, but the
presentation will show how serious it is and how using this technique,
various applications can be “ReDoSed”. These include, among others, Web
Application, WAFs, IDS, AV, Web Servers, Client-side browsers (including
cellular devices), and Database.
**20.30 – 21.00 BSIMM Europe results (Florence Mottay, Managing
Principal Citigal)**
Most large organizations have practiced software security through many
activities involving people, process and automation, but we are just now
reaching the point where enough experience has been accumulated to
compare notes and talk about what works at a macro level. Using the
framework described in Gary McGraw’s book “Software Security: Building
Security In” I will discuss and describe the state of the practice in
software security. This talk is infused with real data from the field,
based on my work with several large companies as a Cigital consultant.
Florence Mottay is a seasoned Business Manager and adept Security
Expert. She is responsible for the long-term growth, stability, market
leadership, and client satisfaction of the company's EMEA operations. At
her former company, Security Innovation, she was the visionary behind
Team Mentor, the company's first-of-a-kind software security knowledge
management system that guides software development and test teams
through the process of consistently developing secure applications.
Other areas of expertise include Threat Modeling for the Enterprise and
Customized Enterprise Security Solutions. Previously, Florence was a
Software Test Engineer for JD Edwards. She was also a Project Leader at
the Center for Software Engineering Research at the Florida Institute of
Technology where she worked for Dr. Whittaker, the founder of Security
Innovation. Florence has a BS in Applied Mathematics and an MS in
Software Engineering from the Florida Institute of Technology.
**21.00 – 21:30 Discussion, questions and social networking**

**18:00 - 18:30 Check-In (catering included)**
**18:30 - 18:45 Introduction (OWASP organization, projects, sponsor)**
**18.45 - 19.45 Unauthorized Access (Wil Allsopp)
**

Physical Penetration Testing and Social Engineering have been conducted
by testing organisations for some time but there has been very little
discussion within the industry regarding the use of formal approaches
ensuring a consistently high quality and repeatability of the testing
lifecycle.

This was a problem I attempted to address in the book Unauthorized
Access and is the focus of this discussion.

We will look at the following:

  - What is physical penetration testing and what does it aim to
    achieve?
  - Tactical approaches to Social Engineering in testing.
  - The advantages and disadvantages of deploying SE.
  - Training operators and building operating teams - what skill sets
    should you deploy?
  - What are the legal aspects involved, how do these vary between
    jurisdictions?
  - How should you plan a physical penetration test at strategic,
    tactical and operational levels?
  - How do you gauge risk i.e. Contractual, Operational, Legal and
    Environmental?


The biggest problem currently facing physical penetration testing teams
is that it's hard to prove a negative i.e. a failed test by no means
guarantees the security of the client. By ensuring your team is trained
and prepared you can mitigate this problem to a large degree.**

'''18.30 - 18.45 Introduction (OWASP organization, projects, sponsor)
'''
'''18.45 - 19.45 AppSec-EU 2009 (Sebastien Deleersnyder, Telindus) '''
Update on the AppSec-EU 2009:
OWASP State of the union, an update on OWASP and OWASP projects and of
course the highlights of the AppSec-EU 2009 presentations.

'''19.45 - 20.00 Break '''
'''20.00 - 20.30 VAC Cross-Site Request Forgery (Niels Teusink, Fox-IT)
'''
([Media:20090409_VAC-CSRF-Niels_Teusink.pdf](Media:20090409_VAC-CSRF-Niels_Teusink.pdf "wikilink"))
CSRF is an attack which forces an end user to execute unwanted actions
on a web application in which he/she is currently authenticated. With a
little help of social engineering (like sending a link via email/chat),
an attacker may force the users of a web application to execute actions
of the attacker's choosing. A successful CSRF exploit can compromise end
user data and operation in case of normal user. If the targeted end user
is the administrator account, this can compromise the entire web
application.

Niels Teusink holds a bachelor degree in Computer Science and has been
experimenting with IT security for over a decade. He has worked for
Fox-IT since 2005; first as a software engineer and since 2007 as a
penetration tester. He has since performed dozens of penetration tests
for all sorts of companies, including governments, banks and nuclear
installations.

'''18.45 - 19.30 Modern information gathering; how to abuse search
engines Dave van Stein
'''([Media:20090409_passsive_reconnaissance-Dave_van_Stein.pdf](Media:20090409_passsive_reconnaissance-Dave_van_Stein.pdf "wikilink"))
Great generals already know the key to success is "knowing your enemy".
In hacking terms this is called information gathering, fingerprinting or
reconnaissance. Traditionally this phase consisted of using public
records like WHOIS and DNS combined with active scans on servers. With
the rise of advanced search engines like Yahoo, Live Search and Google a
whole new type of reconnaissance has come to life; passive
reconnaissance. Often servers are not properly configured which causes
lots of valuable information to become available without accessing the
server at all. Recently several hacker-tools appeared which use the full
capabilities of these search engines giving hackers a head-start at
mapping the network they plan to attack. The goal of this session is to
give insight in the methods and tools hackers have at their disposal to
gather information about systems they plan to attack without accessing
the system itself. Dave van Stein has close to 8 years of experience in
software testing. Since the beginning of 2008 he's working for
ps_testware as a web application security testing specialist.

Martin Visser is a software designer with Sogeti Nederland B.V.
specialized in secure application development with Microsoft
technologies. He has experience with Microsoft server technologies like
ASP.NET, SharePoint and Biztalk. Martin also developed and teaches a
2-day "Application Security - Microsoft development" course both within

Wouter van Kuipers '''
([Media:20090409_presentatie_Wouter_van_Kuipers.pdf](Media:20090409_presentatie_Wouter_van_Kuipers.pdf "wikilink"))
Het ontwikkelen van webapplicaties verschilt op verschillende aspecten
met het ontwikkelen van desktop applicaties, met name op het gebied van
security. Voor grote bedrijven zijn er oplossingen beschikbaar als
bijvoorbeeld SDL, maar voor het midden- en kleinbedrijf zijn dit soort
oplossingen beperkt, omdat zij vaak niet de middelen hebben om
dergelijke strategieën uit te kunnen voeren. Voor zijn scriptie heeft
Wouter van Kuipers middels een literatuuronderzoek, interviews met
ontwikkelaars en een onderzoek naar Fortify 360 gekeken hoe het midden-
en kleinbedrijf omgaat met deze verschillen en hoe zij het
ontwikkelproces kunnen optimaliseren op het gebied van security.

Na een MBO opleiding in de IT is Wouter van Kuipers via de HBO opleiding
'Communicatie Systemen' begin 2007 begonnen met een master
Informatiekunde aan de Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen, welke hij in maart
dit jaar hoopt af te ronden. Tijdens zijn MBO studie is zijn interesse
in het ontwikkelen van webapplicaties gewekt, wat in 2003 resulteerde in
het opzetten van een eigen web-development bedrijf. Dit bedrijf is met
name gespecialiseerd in het ontwikkelen van webapplicaties op maat, en
het ondersteunen van bedrijven op het gebied van web-developement op
freelance basis.

#### Chapter Meeting Minutes

### Meeting minutes December 10th 2009

At December 10th 2009, the Dutch OWASP chapter met in Doorn. The sponsor
of the evening was ps_testware. The subject of the evening was Secure
Software Development. There were 4 speakers planned, but only one showed
up. The others were sick or having travel difficulties. Due to bad
weather and extremely long traffic jams, only 8 attendees joined us in
two great presentations.
Adar Weidman presented his research on Regular Expressions Denial of
Service. The presentation can be downloaden from
[here](http://www.owasp.org/images/3/38/20091210_VAC-REGEX_DOS-Adar_Weidman.pdf).

Martin Knobloch filled in the slot that was left and talked about
several OWASP projects.

Great stuff as you can see\! We hope to see you on our next Chapter
meeting...

### Meeting minutes September 24th 2009

At September 24th 2009, the Dutch OWASP chapter met in Eindhoven. The
sponsor of the evening was Madison Gurkha. The subject of the evening
was Unautorized Access. There were 4 speakers and 21 attendees.

After a short welcome talk by Ferdinand Vroom from OWASP, Madison Gurkha
gave a small introduction to the company. Madison Gurkha is a small firm
that focuses on the prevention, identification, and prevention of
technical IT security problems throughout organizations. As such their
scope reaches beyond that of web application testing up to the level of
physical security. In practice they often see the OWASP top 10
vulnerabilities and use OWASP tools in their assessments, hence their
interest in the OWASP.

**First presentation:** Unauthorized Access by Wil Allsopp.
Wil Allsopp performs Physical Penetration Tests at Madison Gurkha and
recently wrote a book about the subject: Unauthorised Access: Physical
Penetration Testing For IT Security Teams
[1](http://www.amazon.com/Unauthorised-Access-Physical-Penetration-Security/dp/0470747617).
Physical Security is all hacking your way into physical locations, like
buildings, by using a combination of reconnaissance, social engineering,
and technical skills. Like all forms of testing these assessments can
only be successful when performed in a structured manner. The first
phase is the preparation phase in which the target is studied and a team
with a balance of several expertises is selected. Obviously the legal
consequences and risks for bodily harm can be more severe in conducting
a physical security test. Therefore a careful preparation also includes
covering these risks and defining solid boundary conditions.
In the second phase the actual test is done meaning that the team will
try to enter a facility according to a well prepared plan. Since
physical security deals with real people and other unpredictable
circumstances, this phase heavily relies on social engineering skills
and being creative. Test can be conducted in three modes of operation:
overt (use the system as much as possible), covert (minimize contact),
and unseen (apply stealth). The last phase is off course the reporting
phase.
Wil clearly showed in his presentation that testing for physical
security introduces whole new dimensions of interaction to take into
account, but is in fact no different in approach than other forms of
testing.

**Second presentation:** Mini Meetings Results by Barry van Kampen en
Dave van Stein.
As mentioned in the meeting minutes of May 28th 2009
[2](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Netherlands#Meeting_minutes_May_28th_2009)
the Dutch OWASP chapter decided to schedule mini-meetings. These
meetings will facilitate an open discussion about a single topic of
interest. Although only 1 of the 3 planned meetings actually took place,
the results of this meeting were above expectations. The topic of this
mini-meeting was "Quick-scans and other time-boxed test approaches". The
conclusions were that these time-boxed test approaches are capable of
quickly uncovering fundamental problems even while the scope is limited.
Plans are to have a second meeting and maybe even start an OWASP project
on the topic.
Since mini-meets are planned for and by the community, everybody is
invited to check the mini-meet Wiki
[3](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Netherlands_Mini_Meeting_2009) and
propose topics, dates or locations.

**Third presentation:** OWASP Education Project by Martin Knobloch.
The awareness that application security is essential in the development
and deployment of every web application is increasing, but it is often
still applied as an end-of-pipe solution. The OWASP Education Project
[4](http://www.owasp.org/index.php?title=Category:OWASP_Education_Project)
tries to remediate this problem by delivering education material about
OWASP tooling, methodologies, and principles. The project continuously
creates educational & documentation papers, screen scrape video courses
and learning environments and courses. By providing these materials to
the community the OWASP body of knowledge can be spread in a controlled
manner and deliver high quality training, both inside and outside of the
OWASP community.
To improve the quality and progress of this project, contributors are
needed on all areas. Therefore everybody is encouraged to take a look at
the project Wiki and invited to help make the (virtual) world a better
and safer place\!

### Meeting minutes May 28th 2009

At May 28th, the Dutch OWASP chapter came together at the ASR building
in Amersfoort. The main topic of the evening was AppSec 2009. There were
2 speakers and approximately 20 attendees.

There was no sponsor talk or general announcement so after a very short
welcome talk by Bert the evening started.

**First presentation:** AppSec 2009 by Sebastien Deleersnyder.
The first presentation of the evening was a recap of AppSec 2009 in
Poland. The conference was a big success with around 170 attendees. The
meeting preceded the 2009 edition of Confidence
[5](http://2009.confidence.org.pl/) resulting in a week of security
presentations and workshops. All AppSec presentations and many movies,
pictures, and other material can be found on the AppSec wiki
[6](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSec_Europe_2009_-_Poland)
but a few items are worth mentioning in specific. First of all OWASP is
growing and changing. These changes include a simplification of the
membership fees, the introduction of a 'code of ethics', and a general
review of all 120 projects. Other highlights are the project ASVS, which
has reached an international standard status and updated versions of
WebGoat and LabRat.
Lastly besides a Wiki and a LinkedIn group, OWASP is now also active on
Twitter [7](http://twitter.com/owasp) & [8](http://twitter.com/owasp_nl)
and has two overview pages with all video
[9](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Video) and audio
materials [10](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Podcast).
Feel free to use all the materials (as long as you abide by the new code
of ethics off course) and visit the OWASP websites frequently for
updates \!

**Second presentation:** VAC Cross-Site Request Forgery by Niels
Teusink.
After succesfull VAC's about SQL injection and Cross-site scripting, the
topic of this evening's VAC was Cross-site Request Forgery, also known
as CSRF. CSRF is probably one of the least understood vulnerabilities,
but can have tremendous consequences when succesfully exploited. In
essence it is an attack that misuses the victim's autorisations with
malicious scripts. CSRF attacks can also be easily combined with other
attack, like e.g. XSS, making them even more dangerous.
Despite the name suggests, these attacks do not have to be on different
websites (domains). With the continuing trend to combine multiple
functionalities in a single application, so-called onsite request
forgeries are becoming more and more frequent. Contrary to XSS and SQL
injection, CSRF can not be blocked by input validation. In order to
prevent these kind of attacks, an application has to able to verify the
authenticity of a request. This can be achieved by several methods like
using a unique identifier for a session or each request or requiring
additional user input like a CAPTCHA or a one-time token.

**Open Discussion**
The evening was closed with an open discussion about how to improve
knowledge sharing among the OWASP members. Many interesting discussions
start during the drinks after the presentations on the OWASP evenings,
discussions that sadly often are stopped prematurly due to time
restraints.
As an addition on the quarterly presentation evenings, the Dutch chapter
decided to also start mini-meetings and the OWASP cafe.
Mini-meetings will not be planned on beforehand, but instead will be
planned when a topic is proposed and enough attendees have stated an
interest in the topic. The attendees will have to select a location
themselves but can request a donation from the OWASP for drinks and
snacks. Topics discussed at the mini-meeting will have to be listed in
minutes so other members can also profit from this knowledge exchange.
The OWASP cafe will be planned each first thursday of the month on a
location that will be listed on the OWASP Dutch chapter site. The rules
are simple: the evening starts at a certain time, ends at a certain time
and will be filled with drinks, snacks, and nerd/hacker/geek humor and
discussions in between.
Check the website frequently for the location of the next mini-meeting
and OWASP cafe \!

### Meeting minutes April 9th 2009

At April 9th, the Dutch OWASP chapter came together at the office of
Sogeti in Vianen. The main topic of the evening was "knowing your
enemy". There were 3 speakers and approximately 50 attendees.

The sponsor of the evening started with a small welcome and an overview
of their internal security program named PASS. After some small
announcements from the OWASP the evening started.

**First presentation:** Modern information gathering; how to abuse
search engines by Dave van Stein.
The first presentation of the evening was about using search engines and
crawlers to gain detailed information about webservers and websites. Ill
configured webservers allow search engine crawlers to collect much
information about a system, information that is stored and can be
retrieved with search engines. Many websites and tools make use of this
mechanism and, combined with DNS and WHOIS information, are able to
provide detailed or sensitive information like usernames,
vulnerabilities, present files or network topology about a system
without targeting it directly.
Restricting crawlers to access a system can act as a first line of
defence and reduce exposure and risks.

**Second presentation:** VAC Cross-site scripting by Martin Visser.
The second VAC on an OWASP meeting was about Cross-site scripting also
known as XSS. XSS vulnerabilities are often misunderstood and
underestimated but facts show that XSS vulnerability abusing attacks are
nowadys the fastest growing and most widespread type of exploit. In
short XSS vulnerabilities allow for user input to be executed when
containing javascript or HTML code. When combined with other
vulnerabilities the possibilities of these attacks are vitually
limitless.
The only way to prevent these attacks is to sanitize all input and
output fields, but this can be more difficult than it appears to be.
Simply blacklisting fragments like

<script>

is not sufficient due to the possibility of recursivity (e.g. \<scr

<script>

ipt\>) and encoding (e.g. URL encoding: %3C%73%63%72%69%70%74%3E). Using
multiple layers of filters on various places is the only way to assure
enough protection against these types of attacks.

**Third presentation:** Beveiligingsaspecten van
webapplicatie-ontwikkeling by Wouter van Kuipers.
The third presentation of the evening was about the efficiency of a
source code analyer for php based websites. Approximately 33% of all
websites use php and this can be explained by the low learning curve and
ease of use of the language. Due to the low learning curve many php
developers have little experience with programming and almost no
awareness regading security resulting in many unsecure websites. Source
code analysis can help preventing many security issues, but their usage
does have some limitations. Firstly the scan on itself takes only a few
minutes, but analysing the results requires much longer and depends
greatly on how familiar the analyser is with the scanned source code.
Second these analysers produce many flase positives, making analysis
even more time consuming. Lastly not all vulnerabilities are detected
with the same efficiency. Especially vulnerabilities that are dependent
on the application logic like injection or XSS are not always
efficiently detected.
Concluding, like all tools, a source code analyser can be a powerful
tool, but one has to be aware of its limitations. These tools can
provide results very fast, but when used on unfamiliar code the analysis
can be very time consuming.

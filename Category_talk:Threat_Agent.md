I can appreciate the attempt made to clarify threats with respect to
risk, but a redirection on the wiki from threat to threat agent does
not, in my opinion, clarify the most basic concept of threat. The
definition of 'threat agent' is distinct from the definition of
'threat'. Agent implies a causative entity and, in the case of the wiki
entry, I think has been roughly sketched. What has not been done yet is
to define the types of events (the threat) the causative entity (threat
agent) brings about. Perhaps a rough workflow of a standard security
event (a system compromise) will serve to identify the necessary
components that need definition. This may also provide the context
needed to keep the definitions from shifting. Here is my previous
comment on threat:

    Thanks for the comments. You're absolutely right. The intent was not
    to indicate that 'threat' and 'threat agent' are the same thing. We
    simply moved the page and it left a redirect behind automatically. I
    like the idea of creating a model for the 'workflow' or attack-flow
    or risk-flow or whatever. Can you help us put an article together?

## Conference Training Day - Two Day Training Courses - November 12th-13th, 2007

OWASP has arranged to have six 2-day Application Security training
courses prior to the conference.

The first three courses will be provided by a long time contributor to
OWASP, Aspect Security. The fourth course will be provided by another
active OWASP member, the Arctec Group. The fifth course is being
provided by Dinis Cruz, the OWASP Chief Evangelist. The sixth course is
being presented by frequent OWASP/WASC contributor Breach Security. Most
of these courses were offered in their 1-day format at the last two
OWASP AppSec conferences and were well received. This is the first OWASP
conference where we have been able to expand these classes to their
2-day format.

These courses are being offered to attendees of the OWASP conference at
a significant discount to their standard commercial price. Most of the
course fee will go to OWASP to support the OWASP Foundation's efforts.

## T1. Building and Testing Secure Web Applications - 2-Day Course - Nov 12-13, 2007

**Course Overview**

Most developers, IT professionals, and auditors learn what they know
about application security on the job, usually by making mistakes.
Application security is not a part of many computer science curricula
today and most organizations have not focused on instituting a culture
that includes application security as a core part of their IT security
efforts.

This powerful two day course focuses on the most common web application
security problems, including the OWASP Top Ten. The course will
introduce and demonstrate hacking techniques, illustrating how
application vulnerabilities can be exploited so students really
understand how to avoid introducing such vulnerabilities into their
code.

**Details**

This course starts with a module designed to raise awareness of just how
insecure most web applications are. We demonstrate how easily hackers
are able to attack web applications, and what some of the most common
and most significant vulnerabilities are. The course then provides an
overview of how web applications work from a security perspective.

The next modules detail a number of specific security areas. We describe
common vulnerabilities, present best practices, and discuss recommended
approaches for avoiding such vulnerabilities. This course includes
coverage of the following web application security areas (which
encompass the entire OWASP Top 10 plus more):

  - Authentication and Session Management
  - Access Control
  - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - Input Validation
  - Protecting Sensitive Data (w/ Crypto)
  - Caching, Pooling, and Reuse Errors
  - Database Security (Including SQL Injection)
  - Error Handling and Logging
  - Denial of Service
  - Code Quality
  - Accessing Services Securely
  - Setting Security Policy
  - Integrating Security into the SDLC

For each area, the course covers the following:

  - Theoretical foundations
  - Recommended security policies
  - Common pitfalls when implementing
  - Details on historical exploits
  - Best practices for implementation

**Hands on Exercises**

To cement the principles delivered via the lecture portion of the
course, students can participate in a number of hands-on security
testing exercises. During the hands-on exercises students will attack a
live web application (i.e., WebGoat) that has been seeded with common
web application vulnerabilities. The students will use proxy tools
commonly used by the hacker community to complete the exercises.

**Requirements**

If you are interested in participating in the hands on portion of the
course, please bring a Windows based laptop.

## T4. Web Services and XML Security - 2-Day Course - Nov 12-13, 2007

**Course Overview**

The movement towards Web Services and Service Oriented architecture
(SOA) paradigms requires new security paradigms to deal with new risks
posed by these architectures. This session takes a pragmatic approach
towards identifying Web Services security risks and selecting and
applying countermeasures to the application, code, web servers,
databases, application, and identity servers and related software.

Many enterprises are currently developing new Web Services and/or adding
and acquiring Web Services functionality into existing applications --
now is the time to build security into the system\!

**Details**

Topics covered include understanding how web application risks (such as
those in OWASP Guide and OWASP Top Ten) apply in a Web Services world,
and Web Services security topics including:

  - Web Services attack patterns
  - Common XML attack patterns
  - Data and XML security using WS-Security, SAML, XML Encryption and
    XML Digital Signature
  - Identity services and federation with SAML and Liberty
  - Hardening Web Services servers
  - Input validation for Web Services
  - Integrating Web Services securely with backend resources and
    applications using WS-Trust
  - Secure Exception handling in Web Services

## T5. Leveraging OWASP Tools and Documents to Secure Your Enterprise - 2-Day Course - Nov 12-13, 2007

**Course Overview**

Apart from OWASP's Top 10, most OWASP projects
(https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Project) are not widely
used and understood. In most cases this is not due to lack of quality
and usefulness of those Document & Tool projects, but due to a lack of
understanding of where they fit in an Enterprise's security ecosystem or
in the Web Application Development Lifecycle (WADL)

This course aims to change that by providing detailed presentations of
the most mature and enterprise ready projects together with practical
examples of how to use them.

Curriculum

  - Part 1: OWASP Documentation Projects
  - Part 2: OWASP Tools
  - Part 3: Using OWASP in the Enterprise
  - Part 4: Using OWASP in the WADL (Web Application Development
    Lifecycle)

**Hands on Exercises**

The course will be very practical where demonstration and hands-on
exercises will be provided for the tools covered.

**Requirements**

If you are interested in participating in the hands on portion of the
course, please bring a laptop.

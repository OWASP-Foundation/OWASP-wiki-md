In most cases this is not due to lack of quality and usefulness of these Document & Tool projects, but due to a lack of understanding of where they fit in an Enterprise's security ecosystem or in the Web Application Development Lifecycle (WADL). This course aims to change that by providing detailed presentations of the most mature and enterprise ready OWASP projects together with practical examples of how to use them.

November 12th - Cenzic is sponsoring a cocktail party at the eBay
facility after the first day of training.

## Tech Expo - Nov 13th-14th

Product vendors demonstrated their application security products to
conference attendees for the first time at this OWASP Conference. The
focus of this expo was on the technical details of the technologies they
are offering in the market to help organizations deal with their
application security issues.

The technology expo was held:

  - November 13th: From 12-2, with lunch included for all the OWASP
    tutorial attendees who will be invited to attend the expo.
  - November 14th: From 11-6 during the first day of the OWASP
    conference.

**Breach Cocktail Party - Nov 13**

To close out the training event and the first day of the tech expo,
Breach kindly agreed to arrange a cocktail party on Tuesday evening.
They sponsored a similar event at Black Hat for a joint OWASP / WASC get
together and it was a roaring success with over 300 attendees. These
have always been great events at previous conferences. For more details

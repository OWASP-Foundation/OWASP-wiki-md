## 2017 Global Board of Directors Election


The OWASP Foundation was established in 2001 as an open community and
software security resource. Since then, OWASP has grown to be globally
recognized as a credible source for application security standards (see
industry citations). Individuals typically find OWASP when searching the
internet for information about software security - and they are happy to
find a reliable source of knowledge built by an extremely open and
passionate community. OWASP is open to anyone. Anyone can attend OWASP's
vendor agnostic local chapter meetings, participate in regional and
global conferences, and contribute to the many OWASP projects. And
anyone can start a new project, form a new chapter, or lend their
expertise to help an OWASP Global Committee.

The OWASP Foundation Board of Directors currently consists of seven
elected volunteers. These unpaid volunteers dedicate themselves to the
organizational mission and playing a pivotal role in the software
security community. OWASP conducts democratic elections of its Board
Members to enable bottom-up advancement of its mission.

### **Call for Questions**

The 2017 Global Board of Directors election will start accepting
candidate submissions on June 6, 2017. If you are interested in helping
lead a global community that strives on making the world a safer place,
then please consider running for a seat on the OWASP Global Board of
Directors.

From August 9 - September 1, 2017 all individuals who submitted a
candidacy will be interviewed, and asked a series of questions about why
they feel they should be elected. The questions they are asked come from
you\! We will take the top 6-7 questions and those will be the questions
used during the candidate interviews. You may submit your own
question(s) and/or give a "thumbs up" to any existing question
previously submitted by your fellow community members.

**The Call for Questions is now CLOSED.**
The questions below are the top 7 questions submitted and voted on by
the OWASP Community. The candidates will be asked a series of these
questions during their group interviews schedule for later this month.

1\. How do you make sure that the board's decisions won't be influenced
by any personal favors or corruption?
2\. OWASP does not have a great reputation internationally due what most
people call "Politics", how do you intend to solve the "Politics"
problem?
3\. How do you intend to address bullying within OWASP? If someone is a
repeat offender, will you enforce rules to expel or suspend offending
parties?
4\. How do you intend to empower the Compliance Committee? Currently all
it has the power to do is mediate or make suggestions, it needs more
than that.
5\. What accomplishments related to OWASP Foundation's mission have you
demonstrated in the last (5) years?
6\. What kind of action plan do you have in mind to help motivate the
participation of Developers into OWASP community?
7\. What is your strategy to keep chapters active and motivated with
OWASP and keep having meetings and organize local events?

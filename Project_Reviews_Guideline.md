<p>Project Reviews is a process within OWASP to help evaluate the health and quality of OWASP projects. The evaluation is based on a defined criteria which attempts to find out the progress and at which stage of development are the projects.</p>
<p>This is the original plan <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Proposal_Project_Review_QA_Approach">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Proposal_Project_Review_QA_Approach</a></p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Projects are divided in 3 main categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code</li>
<li>Tools</li>
<li>Documentation</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the 3 main development classifications</p>
<ul>
<li>Incubators</li>
<li>LAB</li>
<li>Flagship</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="quality_of_a_codetool_projects">Quality of a Code/Tool projects</h2>
<p>This kind of evaluation requires more work. It is necessary to download, install and smoke test the project.</p>
<p>The criteria to evaluate the minimum quality of a project is very simple:</p>
<h4 id="for_code_and_tools">For Code and Tools</h4>
<p>For projects holding Flagship status, we closely monitor their health every 6 months on the following, among other key indicators:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can the project be built correctly?</li>
<li>Does the project has any activity(commits) in the last 6 months?</li>
<li>Does the project had any releases in the last 6 months?</li>
<li>Has the project leaders updated his wiki or website to reflect latest releases?</li>
</ul>

# Basic Instructions

We need regular or season reviewers to help us evaluate projects.

This is how you can help us evaluate the health of a project

  - Check the criteria that applies for each project (see tabs for
    criteria)

Follow the criteria with these instructions:

  - Visit the projects inventory page:
    <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Project#tab=Project_Inventory>
  - Select the project you want to review or the one assigned to you
  - Click on the project wiki page you want to review
  - Check the history /last updated date and by who
  - Check the amount of views on the bottom of the page
  - Read the content and click all hyperlinks available, are there any
    broken?
  - Check and read the mailing list and the subjects discussed
  - Visit the repository's project (like Github) and check the wiki,
    issues, branches
  - Check if the repository is the same as the one in openhub
  - Create a new Google sheet
  - Do some google search on the project and the project leader. Make
    annotations and provide hyperlinks of information found
  - Fill in the sheet. Try to add to your report also some print
    screens, hyperlinks, in other words how did you came to the
    conclusions and findings in the comments sections. It is very
    important that you can sustain the findings provided in your report
    sheet
  - share the sheet through the Project task force mailing list

# Code Criteria

  - Does the project have a publicly accessible bug tracking system
    established, and source code repository?
  - Does the project include online documention built into the tool?
  - Does the project include build scripts that facilitate building the
    application from source?
  - Does this project have an easy to use installer (Goal: Fully
    automated installer) (or stand alone executable version)?
  - Is the tool/deliverable user friendly and easy to use?
  - Smoke test some basic functionalities: Does the project do what they
    claim? (This might required more a simple smoke test)

Use this Google sheet(rename with Project name you will be reviewing) to
fill in your findings:
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1upIyG0L-P-myUM6EPg0aJmCTDvJrdqaVdnjdNBME9is/edit?usp=sharing>

# Tool Criteria

  - Does the project have a publicly accessible bug tracking system
    established, and source code repository?
  - Does the project include online documentation built into the
    library?
  - Does the project include build scripts that facilitate
    building/adding to the application from source?
  - Does this project have an easy to use installer (Goal: Fully
    automated installer) (or stand alone executable version)?
  - Is the library/deliverable user friendly and easy to use?
  - Smoke test some basic functionalities: Does the project do what they
    claim? (This might required more a simple smoke test)

Use this Google sheet(rename with Project name you will be reviewing) to
fill in your findings:
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1upIyG0L-P-myUM6EPg0aJmCTDvJrdqaVdnjdNBME9is/edit?usp=sharing>

# Health Criteria

For general health criteria we use the following:

## Does it meet quality expectations?

  - Does the project have a relevant project summary that can be found
    on the OWASP Project wiki page?

Check the Project wiki page description and introduction sections

  - Does the project have a relevant project Roadmap that can be found
    on the OWASP Project wiki page?

Check a tab call Roadmap, see if there any sore of planning or
projection on releases or deliverables

  - Does the project have a good track record of resolving issues and
    answering questions from project consumers?

The best place to check this is the repository issues and wiki page of
the projects. Does the project have one? Is it easy to find? How many
issues are open/closed?

## Does it follow OWASP Project best practices?

  - Does the project use an appropriate Community Friendly License?

The project wiki page should contain a description with the type of
license provided

  - Are project deliverables, information, and releases readily
    available and accessible to the public?

Does the project have a release version?

  - Do the project leaders and contributors perform their duties in
    accordance to applicable laws?

This is very difficult to asses but try using Google search and finding
information about the leaders of the project

## Does it support the OWASP mission and objectives?

  - Do the project leaders and contributors treat everyone with respect
    and dignity?

This is very difficult to asses but try using Google search and finding
information about the leaders of the project. The project mailing lists
history is a good source for this information

  - Is the project vendor neutral?

Check for things like Logos in their wiki page or repository, mentioning
of commercial activities, logos of vendors in their presentation

  - Is the project free and open and not-for-profit?

again , difficult to asses , but try researching through google and find
if in any form the leaders are commercial exploiting directly the
project by charging users in any form

Does the project have one accepted OWASP reviewed deliverable on record
within the new projectâ€™s infrastructure? Check previous reviews of
projects here:
<https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/spreadsheets/d/15NzgmnxKNtexRDs70rBUi1NHhjQiviBdYUa_kDvd3i4/edit?usp=sharing>

Use this Google sheet(rename with Project name you will be reviewing) to
fill in your findings:
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1upIyG0L-P-myUM6EPg0aJmCTDvJrdqaVdnjdNBME9is/edit?usp=sharing>

# Documentation Criteria

This is a basic check up we do on Documents:

  - Does the project have a publicly accessible bug tracking system
    established, and source code repository?
  - Is the document in a format which can be converted to an OWASP book?
  - Does the project release/deliverable have a table of contents that
    links all the wiki content together?
  - Is the project release/deliverable available for download on the
    OWASP Project wiki page?
  - Has all release/deliverable content been reviewed by a technical
    editor to ensure that English grammar is correct, understandable,
    and the content flows well?

For this part, we are working on the development of an adequate
assessment criteria The following is a draft of the new process
proposal: [Proposal for Reviewing OWASP Document
projects](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Qualitative_and_Quantitative_Content_Audit.pdf)

# Determining Flagship status

The OWASP Flagship designation is given to projects that have
demonstrated superior maturity, established quality, and strategic value
to OWASP and application security as a whole. Eligible projects are
selected from the OWASP Labs project pool. This selection process
generally ensures that there is only one project of each type covering
any particular security space. OWASP Flagship projects represent
projects that are not only mature, but are also projects that OWASP as
an organization provides direct support to maintaining. The core mission
of OWASP is to make application security visible and so as an
organization, OWASP has a vested interest in the success of its Flagship
projects. Since Flagship projects have such high visibility, these
projects are expected to uphold the most stringent requirements of all
OWASP Projects.

The project must fill all of the following criteria to become a OWASP
Flagship project. It is essential for a OWASP Flagship project to have:

  - Considerable number of users and contributors
  - Considerable number of commits and improvements in a time span of at
    least two years
  - A unique approach or proposition in application security
  - Exposure through security conferences
  - Use and acceptance by the community
  - Being used as reference in books and other resources

# Determining LAB status

OWASP Labs projects represent projects that have delivered significant
value. Leaders of OWASP Labs projects are expected to stand behind the
quality of their projects as these projects have matured to the point
where they are accepted by a significant portion of the OWASP community.
While these projects are typically not production ready, the OWASP
community expects that an OWASP Labs project leader is producing
releases that are ready for mainstream usage. OWASP Labs projects are
meant to be a collection of established projects that have gained
community support and acclaim by undergoing the project review process.

An OWASP project must fill all of the following criteria to become an
OWASP Labs project. It is essential for an OWASP Labs project to have:

  - A version number with a clear release schedule
  - GitHub source control and a public issue tracking system
  - Stable build and release
  - Instructions on how to use and build the project properly

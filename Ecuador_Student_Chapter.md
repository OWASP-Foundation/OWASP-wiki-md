## About our Chapter

This chapter was restarted. The Chapter was officially founded by
[Galoget J. Latorre Ch.](User:Galoget_J._Latorre_Ch. "wikilink") as a
Project of [Hackem Research Group](http://hackem-epn.blogspot.com/) at
National Polytechnic School (Quito, Ecuador) in May 2012.

The chapter activities started the same month, after the [OWASP Latam
Tour 2012](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/LatamTour2012#Quito) that was
celebrated at [National Polytechnic School](http://www.epn.edu.ec)
(Quito - Ecuador) with the presence of [Fabio
Cerullo](User:Fabio.e.cerullo "wikilink") who is part of the Global
Education Committee and OWASP Ireland Chapter Leader.

For the Chapter the following resources were created by our members:

participating at different IT events but also by organizing free and
open for everyone conferences, workshops and meetings about Application
Security and Information Security in general.

Also a Special Course in the University was opened and is dictated by
the Chapter Leader in the Systems Engineering Faculty:

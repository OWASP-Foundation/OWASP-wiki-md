In this talk Professor Angell will take the devil's advocate position,
warning that computer technology is part of the problem as well as of
the solution. The belief system at the core of computerization is
positivist and/or statistical, and that itself leads to risk. The
mixture of computers and human activity systems spawns bureaucracy and
systemic risk, which can throw up singularities that defy any
positivist/statistical analysis. Using black humour, Angell discusses
the thin line between the utility of computers and the hazard of chaotic
feedback, and ends with some advice on how to survive and prosper
amongst all this complexity.

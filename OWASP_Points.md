OWASP Points are a system that allows us to recognize an individuals
achievement and accomplishments in OWASP. The system is designed to be
distributed and self nominated.

  - Each [Global Committee](Global_Committee_Pages "wikilink") will
    establish it's own criteria for assigning points for participation
    in the committee's area of responsibility
  - The OWASP Board will establish points for areas outside committee
    areas of responsibility
  - The Committee chairs and a board rep will meet as needed (at least
    quarterly) to normalize the point values
  - OWASP Members will have the ability to self nominate for points
  - Each Committee will be responsible for providing overnight of points
    claimed under their areas

## Mechanics

Members can self-nominate for points by adding the associated "Badge" to
their wiki user account. It is the intention of the point system that
any individual who reaches a total of 100 Points. At the beginning of
each year, half of all member points earned two years ago will be
carried over to the next calendar year. For example, if you earned 100
points in 2009, you would keep your points in 2010, in 2011 you would
get 50 points and in 2012 these points will expire.

For example (add example of me in here and how many points would carry)

## Points

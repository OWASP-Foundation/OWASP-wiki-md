**Watiqay** is a Quechua word (indigenous language of Peru), which means
observe or monitor and is exactly what characterizes this tool.

Watiqay is a tool that perform corrective actions when it detects that

takes the access request and if a file has been changed, if the server
is inaccessible sends a mail indicating that the server is down, if a
file has been added sends a mail to the administrator, if a file has

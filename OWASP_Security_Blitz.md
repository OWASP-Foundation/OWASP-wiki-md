# About

OWASP is starting a monthly security blitz where we will rally the
security community around a particular topic. The topic may be a
vulnerability, defensive design approach, technology or even a
methodology. All members of the security community are encouraged to
write blog posts, articles, patches to tools, videos etc in the spirit
of the current monthly topic. Our goal is to show a variety of
perspectives on the topic from the different perspectives of builders,
breakers and defenders.

# How Can You Help?

## Individual Experts

As an individual please create material on the monthly security topic.
If you have recently created material that is relevant to the month at
hand then please link it in the section below. As mentioned above, the
goal is to have a variety of perspectives (builder, breaker, defender,
policy, etc) and types of content (tools, docs, videos, code patches,
etc)

## Companies / Organizations / Universities

Please consider launching an internal awareness program to coincide with
the security blitz. This will allow all of us to pool resources and
maximize the impact of each month's topic.

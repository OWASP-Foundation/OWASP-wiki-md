### JavaPolis 2006 - Stephen de Vries - Security Sins and their Solutions

Stephen de Vries (project leader of the [OWASP Java
Project](:Category:OWASP_Java_Project "wikilink")) did a talk at
[JavaPolis in Belgium](http://www.javapolis.com) about "Security Sins
and their Solutions" that can be viewed again online on
[Parleys](http://www.bejug.org/confluenceBeJUG/display/PARLEYS/Security+Sins+and+their+Solutions).

The talk covers the most insidious security vulnerabilities in Java Web
and EE applications through practical demonstration of how to exploit
these vulnerabilities and recommendations on how to prevent them. The
threat posed by each vulnerability is explained and strategies for
mitigating the flaw are introduced.

Management](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Image:OWASP_Belgium_Chapter_Meeting_-_Antwerp_-_14_Sep_2006_-_3_Business_Application_security_through_Information_Risk_Management_-_OWASPv1.2.ppt)**
        *Presentation + Discussion*
The presentation showed how ING has implemented business application
security by implementing a risk management approach. By starting from
the definition of risks and risk management, we have changed the program
governance and project lifecycle to ensure that security is not seen as
an add-on in a late stage of the project, but that the security
requirements are defined in the early start of a project. By this
approach the security requirements are becoming real functional
requirements which are supported by the business. The net result is that
security is not an after-thought anymore but totally integrated in the
product and its (functional) requirements. As security requirements have
become demands of the business, they are not taken out when the project
is getting in time and budget constraints. These are all the positive
consequences we have obtained from the method that will be explained
throughout the presentation.

  - 20h05 - 21h00: Guy Crets, Apogado

        **[Secure and Reliable Web
Services](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Image:OWASP_Belgium_Chapter_Meeting_-_Antwerp_-_14_Sep_2006_-_4_Secure_and_Reliable_WS_Guy_Crets.pdf)**
        *Presentation + Discussion*
Web Services are becoming a very popular protocol for communication
between IT systems within and between organizations. Web services offer
a nice alternative for all sorts of communication middleware. The
security of Web Services is a major attention point, now being well
addressed with the WS-Security standards. Guy Crets not only explains
what WS-Security is, but also opens up the subject by addressing many
related topics: how does WS-\* compare to B2B protocols such as EDIINT
AS2, why not use SOAP over email or FTP, the importance of
WS-Addressing, shortcomings in WS-ReliableMessaging, what is the
importance of Microsoft WCF (aka Indigo), ... and many more.

Can "Agile" Development Produce Secure Applications?
Received wisdom has it that secure development and agile processes do
not mix. Is that really so? Agile practices have proven in many
projects to yield applications with fewer functional defects. Can they
also be put to work to reduce the number of security vulnerabilities?
The audience added to the discussion with questions and remarks\!

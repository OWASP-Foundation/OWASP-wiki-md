## Description

The business is not set up to effectively distribute, sell or maintain
products for existing or new customers. Businesses basically fall into
two categories: product providers and service providers. Product
providers sell the products to the customers. Service providers maintain
customerâ€™s throughout the life-cycle. This means that special needs have
to be made to take care of the customer so that they will continue to
use your services.

## Examples

### Decrease in Revenue

A sales tool application is down for two hours which impacts users to
sell products to customers. The Service Level Agreement (SLA) of the
application is not met. Potential loss of revenue for those two hours is
estimated at $200K. (Note: each application has its own SLA agreement
pre-determined and an Application Business Impact Analysis (ABIA) survey
determines the financial loss).

### Profits Sailing Down

Saleable equipment is missing from an application. A customer wants to
purchase one of the missing items and is not able to proceed with their
order. The customer gets frustrated and the sale is lost.

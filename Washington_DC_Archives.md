**August 20th 6:30pm OWASP Meeting, Washington DC**

This month we will be holding our meeting at the DC offices of [Deloitte
& Touche](http://www.deloitte.com/) ([1001 G St NW Washington
DC 20001](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=1001+G+ST+NW+washington+dc)).

The meeting will start at 1830. Upon arriving, please go to the 9th
floor and sign in, someone will escort you to the meeting location, Rm.
8S026. If you are late and can not get in, please call 202.270.8715.

This month, our agenda is as follows:

  - Introduction to OWASP, Rex Booth
  - The Big Picture: Web Risks and Assessments Beyond Scanning, Matt
    Fisher
  - Security Conference Review: Black Hat & DefCon (group discussion)
  - Open floor

Matt's talk will focus on the need to risk and threat model software and
pick appropriate peoples, tools, and testing techniques to test against
the threat model. In today's resource-constrained market many
organizations are simply turning to automation to test their software
security without truly understanding the limitations. This talk will
discuss some of the broader threat cases, testing techniques for them,
and whether current state of the industry technology is effective
against them.

**July 23rd 6:30pm OWASP Meeting, Washington DC (Alexandria)**

This month we will be holding our meeting at the Alexandria offices of
[Grant Thornton](http://www.gt.com) ([333 John Carlyle Street Suite 500
Alexandria
VA](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=333+John+Carlyle+Street+Suite+500+Alexandria,+District+of+Columbia+22314+United+States&ie=UTF-8&oe=utf-8)).

The meeting will start at 1830. If you are late and can not get in,
please call 703.785.9390.

The presentation for this meeting will be a reprise of Mark and Doug's
[Web Application Security and Why It
Matters](http://onelittlewindow.org/blog/?p=26) talk, which was
suggested/requested at the last meeting in Alexandria. The presentation
will cover the topics of the OWASP Top 10 and include demonstrations of
exploits of the Top 5. This is geared towards newcomers to
[OWASP](http://www.owasp.org), but we hope that all members in the DC
Metro area will attend if they have a chance. We also hope to give the
DC crowd a "state of the chapter" like we did at the last meeting
Columbia, and then open discussion of current events and/or any
particular topics of interest will follow.

The presentation can be found
[here](http://onelittlewindow.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/webappsec-101-owasp-jul-08.pdf).

and authentication bypass with other topics as we have time.

**March 20th 6pm OWASP Meeting, Columbia MD**

This month we will be holding our meeting in Columbia MD at Aspect
Securities offices (address below). The meeting will start at 6pm and
last to around 9pm or so (depends on the crowd).

The topic for the meeting will be presentation by Jeff Williams on his
Enterprise Security API project. (quick overview below)

`  `**`Securing``   ``Java``   ``EE``   ``Applications``   ``with``
 ``the``   ``OWASP``   ``Enterprise``   ``Security``   ``API``
 ``(ESAPI)`**

`  Jeff Williams, the CEO of Aspect Security and the volunteer Chair of the`
`  OWASP Foundation, will present the new OWASP Project he is leading --`
`  the OWASP Enterprise Security API (ESAPI). ESAPI is an API and reference`
`  implementation designed to make it as easy as possible for web`
`  developers to address the most common web application security`
`  vulnerabilities, including those discussed in the OWASP Top Ten.`

`  ESAPI defines a simple, well-structured, and obvious interface to all`
`  the classes and methods a developer needs to build a secure web`
`  application, and comes with a reference implementation and over 600 test`
`  cases. ESAPI includes numerous new security mechanisms that are simply`
`  not present in Java EE today, including intrusion detection!`
`  Correctness, completeness, and simplicity are the three primary design`
`  goals of ESAPI.`

`  ESAPI provides a worked example of most security challenges faced by`
`  enterprise developers. Developers, architects, and application security`
`  specialists can use ESAPI as a baseline for what is expected in their`
`  applications. This presentation will cover the basic structure of the`
`  API, why using it represents a significant reduction in application`
`  security costs, and even why it makes projects more agile.`

Look forward to seeing everyone there, so dont forget to set your
outlook/entourage/notes calendars\!

**February 5th 6pm Meeting, New Location\!**

This meeting will be held at a new location thanks to a new host [Grant
Thorton LLP](http://www.grantthorton.com).

Presentations

`   I will be giving a presentation on the intersection between web `
`   application security and the attackers mindset.  The purpose of which is `
`   to drill home that web application security isnt just about SQL `
`   Injection, XSS, XSRF, and "web application compromises.  My approach `
`   will be to outline various methods of abusing web applications to gain a `
`   foot holds onto networks as well as leveraging vuln's to "repurpose" `
`   existing web applications to the attackers whim.   The ultimate goal of `
`   this presentation is to drill home the fact that web applications (and `
`   their insecurities) provide an attacker an amazing attack surface to `
`   leverage for various purposes, purposes which I will talk about.`
`   A few quick highlights include discussions on PHP/ASP* back door shells, `
`   PHP based IRC bots, XSS based Attack frameworks, Flash based attack `
`   frameworks, IDS evasion etc. `

**`Meeting:``   ``December``   ``14th``   ``6PM`**

December Meeting Announcement

This OWASP meeting will be held at a new location in Arlington per the
chapters request. Please note that this **IS NOT** a permanent shift in
venue, but merely an attempt to include those chapter members who are
not able to make it to Columbia on a regular basis.

**Agenda**

1.  Opening, introductions
2.  Presentation by Eric Pascarello: Investigating JavaScript and Ajax
    Security
3.  Possible "Unannounced" presentation
4.  Everything Else: Current Events, OWASP news, Industry News, Recent
    Hacks in the News, Closing, etc.
5.  BoF discussion on AJAX and AJAX security

Dont know who Eric is? Well here is a quick blurb I "liberated" from a
website about him.

[Eric Pascarello dissects Ajax security
vulnerabilities](http://searchwebservices.techtarget.com/qna/0,289202,sid26_gci1164745,00.html)

Eric Pascarello is the co-author of "Ajax in Action" (Manning
Publications, October 2005, and the author of "JavaScript: Your Visual
Blueprint for Building Dynamic Web Pages", 2nd Edition (Wiley, October
2004). Pascarello is a 2002 Graduate of Penn State University with a
degree in mechanical engineering. He is also a "bartender" on
JavaRanch.com. In this interview he talks about Ajax security issues,
the need for server-side validation and the Ajax worm released last
October on MySpace.com

I am also trying to work out another presentation that will fit our
general "theme" of application security as well. (more details to
come\!) And as always I will try to go over the latest and greatest
application security news. (think myspace and quicktime)

This is going to be a technical meeting focusing on AJAX Security.

In case you weren't aware, AJAX is a clever use of existing technologies
to provide richer interfaces on the web (think Google Maps). It's
growing in popularity and "buzz", so be sure to make this meeting and
learn all you can about it.

If you have some AJAX science you'd like to drop on us, then email me
directly at mfisher at spidynamics dot com

If you need help getting to the meeting, try emailing the list and
asking for a lift.

There are two MARC stations within a twenty minute drive, and the MTA
contracted commuter busses drop off within 2 miles of the offices.

Wireless:

I am please to announce that we may just have wireless access for the
meeting. No promises, but if you're the type who likes to look stuff up
realtime then you may want to bring the laptop.

If we \*are\* lucky to enough to get wireless access, there will be a
serious "no playing around" policy in place, and anyone breaking it will
be kick/banned for life, y'all hear ?

**`December``   ``Meeting``   ``Notes`**

\[Note: there was no meeting in November due to the holiday crunch. We
decided to hold just one meeting in December\].

Greetings from the Northern side of the Beltway. I wanted to send out a
note to everyone letting them know how great the meeting was last night.
The turn out was the perfect size for some "fireside chats".... It was
some of the most technical conversation I've had in a long time that
didn't involve an instant messenging client.

First of all, Thanks again to the ever-generous Aspect Security whom
provided not only meeting space, but pizza and a chaperone as well. I'm
glad to say that Chuck was there too .. Chuck is one of our most highly
technical meetings, and shows up every time, on time.

For those of you who didn't make it, here's what we discussed. Note that
I said \*discussed\*; not presentations. The smaller size of this
meeting really afforded some great technical conversation and the loose
interactive format was spectacular. If you missed it , well then you
missed out.

1.  Susan Suskin gave us her thoughts on the AppSec conference for those
    you who missed the conference. Apparently the majority of the
    conference rocked, except for some lam3r presentation on web
    application worms (mine) .
2.  NIST's SAMATE project. This is a government funded project that
    attempts to a) gain serious expertise in app sec to the point of
    being able to 2) define key performance capabilities of app sec
    tools, 3) define metrics for those capabilities, 4) create test
    environments against those metrics, and then 5) evaluate and report
    on all app sec tools. Discussion of this spun off of the discussion
    of the conference.
3.  \*\*The recent GMail hack\*\*. This was really well done (props
    Andre ) . Instead of doing a \*presentation\* on it, shots from the
    original 'explanation' site was passed around and we all deciphered
    it together, making a true learning and discussion opportunity.
    Unfortunately this also mitigated our ability to mock his lamer
    slides, but I secretly mocked his lamer xeroxing capabilities. I'm
    just kidding of course: Andre xerox's like a champ. I think he's
    certified in it or something.
4.  \*\*A Tutorial Walk-Through of SQL Injection and Blind SQL
    Injection\*\* along with \*nasty evasive destructive SQL
    Injections\*, followed by the Web App Sec comedy hour. Those of you
    who missed the AppSec conference and also missed the meeting last
    night missed all the humour. Plus, you'll never understand how
    astute Donald Rumsfeld is with input validation. \[ If you this far,
    then you get an extra slice of pizza next meeting \]. My next
    presentation will be stone-cold serious, but equally lame. My
    presentations should improve once I finish my PowerPoint
    certification study class.
5.  ShmooCon \! The coolest conference you'll find in the area. Be there
    are be square. <http://www.shmoocon.org/> If you are already
    registered for the conference and aren't staying at the Wardman, ,
    then please consider booking a room - they need this to lock in the
    hotel for next year. I'm local, and I have a room \!
6.  \*\*AJAX\*\* - what it is, what is isn't, who's using it, how it
    works, and the security implications of it. We all agreed that none
    of us know enough about it and we're looking for someone with some
    real expertise to educate us on it. I for one am willing to chip in
    some bucks for a serious education on it. If we all chipped in, we
    may be able to get someone to give us a couple hours of tutorial on
    it. Thoughts ?

Next Meeting:

For our next gig, we're trying to get none other than a Special Agent
from the Federal Bureau of Investigations to talk to us about the real
world legal and prosecutorial environment in relations to cyber
intrusions. We will also discuss the latest and greatest hacks, vulns
and exploit techniques.

We'd like to see if there's a way to get internet access for the
attendees as well. For instance, last night we really could have used a
Spanish L33t to English L33t Dictionary while deciphering the Gmail
hack. It would be great for doing quick googles, demo's etc. If there
are any ideas on how we could secure some wireless that would not place
us on the host's network, then please bring it. Netstumbling the office
doesn't count.

So now you know, and knowing's half the battle.

\- Matt

At the July 19th meeting, the DC-Maryland chapter took on the topic of
the "broken top-ten". We spent 2 and a half hours and digressed many
times. Often getting lost in the weeds. We did have some useful ideas (I
do apologize to the rest of the chapter as these thoughts are largely
influenced by my opinions -ed tracy).

After discussing the problems with the many uses of the top ten, we
asked what does the industry need. The industry needs awareness and
guidance. These are two different things. We will admit it has been
great for awareness, aka marketing. And, a concern of changing the top
ten is given: a radical change in the top ten is likely to diminish its
reputation and its effectiveness at raising awareness.

Now back to guidance (the other thing the industry needs)...The top ten
is being used for education, security review checklist,
design/implementation guide, etc. Well, the industry needs these things
in very concise form. We should give them that. OWASP should produce
these (I know some of it's been produced al y). These shouldn't be top
tens or marketed as top tens, as ten is not going to cover everything
and having ten top-tens is silly.

The key is to put a big disclaimer in The top ten that advises people
not to use it for review checklist, design guide, etc. The disclaimer
should go on to point people in the right direction for guidance for
each of those tasks. We believe the top ten should warn people that it's
not fit for those other tasks. Otherwise, they think it is and that
creates "FUD."

**`Training``   ``Session``   ``Notes``   ``-``   ``6/7/05`**

We held a training session for web app security in early June. About 15
people trickled in at all hours.

Thanks Aspect Security, for providing installation CDs with WebGoat,
WebScarab, and Paros.

As a group, we did some of the WebGoat exercises using the WebScarab
application proxy.

Thanks to Chuck for demonstrating bean scripting in WebScarab. It's used
to automate testing.

Thanks to Matt Fisher for demonstrating Spi Dynamics' WebInspect and its
web proxy capabilities.

WebScarab and WebGoat presentation by Dave Wichers

:\*
[WebScarab](http://www2.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_WebScarab_Project),
written by [Rogan Dawes](mailto:rogan@users.sourceforge.net) and donated
to OWASP, has been around about five years in one form or another
(please let Rogan know if you use it\!)

:\* Current version at
<http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=64424&package_id=61823>

:\* Includes a man-in-the-middle proxy, HTTP request/response editor,
filtering traffic logger, session ID analyzer, passive web spider,
automatic response modifier, encoder/decoder/hasher, and more; it’s also
scriptable with Java Beanshell

:\* Dave took us through several of the
[WebGoat](http://www2.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_WebGoat_Project) lessons
using WebScarab to manipulate traffic and explained common
vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting

:\* We were showed how to use WebScarab to intercept browser requests
and change it before sending it to the server

:\* Discussed some authentication and session management methods such as
HTTP Basic Auth (bad), Tomcat JSESSIONID (good), using SSL only for the
login (bad), etc.

:\* WebScarab will point out which pages on your site set cookies

:\* It will show you both raw and formatted HTTP requests and responses
and show you a hex editor-like view of binary data such as images

General Discussion

:\* Discussed the dilemma of accidentally finding a vulnerability on a
public site...do you disclose or not? Will they think you’re a cracker
or a saint...or just ignore you?

:\* Discussed what other tools people use, commercial and free: Appscan,
WebInspect, Sleuth, Nstealth, Achilles, Odysseus, Paros, etc. Some
limited use of both the commercial and free scanning tools was
identified.

:\* Discussed web application "firewalls". No one in the group indicated
they were using any of these products.

:\* DISA has a checklist for application security (called the
Application Security Checklist) at:
<http://csrc.nist.gov/pcig/cig.html>, and NIST is working on the FISMA
guidelines, but until there’s a federal regulation on secure development
it will be hard to convince them to (pay to) do it

:\* Discussed the conundrum of developers having no motivation to think
security; mentioned putting security requirements in the
business/software requirements; mentioned the OWASP secure software
contract annex (http://www.owasp.org/docroot/owasp/misc/contract.doc)

:\* Discussed the new application code scanning tools, Ounce Lab's
Prexis, Fortfy, and Klocwork were all mentioned. Some members had
received briefings on them but no significant use was discussed.

:\*\*Since the meeting, some articles about these tools have been
identified and are included here for reference:

:\*\*\* Here's a recent (Jan 2005) article about Fortify:
<http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/01/14/03TCfortify_1.html>

:\*\*\* Here's an older (Jul 2004) article about a previous release of
Ounce's Prexis: <http://www.sdtimes.com/news/106/story12.htm>

:\*\*\* A summary of mostly open source application security code
analysis tools is available here:
<http://sardonix.org/Auditing_Resources.html>

:\*\*\* A general article about the emerging web app security
capabilities: "Emerging web app security services and products bring
source code vulnerabilities to light"
<http://infosecuritymag.techtarget.com/ss/0,295796,sid6_iss467_art975,00.html>

:\*\*\* And in the same Information Security mag article is a summary
chart of various product and service vendors in the space:
<http://infosecuritymag.techtarget.com/ss/0,295796,sid6_iss467_art978,00.html>

:\*\*\* The Vendors' pages for these products are at:

**`Meeting``   ``Notes``   ``-``   ``12/28/04`**

No meeting this month due to the holidays. Happy holidays\!

**`Meeting``   ``Notes``   ``-``   ``11/23/04`**

This month's meeting was again held in the first floor conference room
at [Aspect Security](http://www.aspectsecurity.com), the chapter's
sponsor. A couple "regulars" couldn't make it due to the holiday but it
was still well-attended.

IMPORTANT: Future meetings will continue to be on the fourth Tuesday of
the month--so the next meeting will be on December 28, again at 6pm. As
long as Aspect can reserve the conference room for us, we'll continue
meeting there.

Minutes: A slightly smaller group allowed us to keep discussion on topic
more easily this month.

:\* GEMS Demo: Demonstration of the insecurity of Diebold's General
Election Management System (GEMS). See
<http://www.equalccw.com/dieboldtestnotes.html> for more details.

:\* DropMyRights: Discussed use of dropmyrights.exe when you're running
as administrator but want to run your email and browser with lower
privileges. Just create a shortcut that contains "C:\\Program
Files\\dropmyrights\\DropMyRights.exe" "C:\\Program Files\\Internet
Explorer\\iexplore.exe" and use that instead of directly invoking the
browser. See
<http://msdn.microsoft.com/security/securecode/columns/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dncode/html/secure11152004.asp>
for the tool and a short article.

:\* OWASP Secure Software Contract Annex: Jeff Williams prepared a draft
of this document as a starting point for helping people write software
development contracts that include security. We discussed how this
contract emphasizes the lifecycle steps, whereas the Ounce Labs version
emphasizes specific vulnerabilities. We also discussed the fact that the
contract includes "requirements for the requirements" instead of trying
to cover everything. The document needs more work on the "teeth," i.e.
how to ensure that each element is specific enough to audit. Also, it
needs some more work on including risk-related activities before the
requirements. The plan is to incorporate a few comments, get approval
from the OWASP-Leaders, send it out to
[WebAppSec](http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/107) and stand up an
OWASP project to maintain the document.

:\*\* The OWASP Mission: The contract discussion led into questions
about OWASP's constituency and how we are serving them. One view is that
OWASP serves developers and the contract effort is not exactly on
target. The other view we discussed is that OWASP is focused on the
problem of insecure software, and it should do whatever is necessary to
raise awareness of the issue. We also discussed OWASP's role as a
platform for the application security community. Is OWASP an "if you
build it, they will come" model?

:\*\* Open Letter and Requirements Project: We discussed the Open Letter
and how it looks like the various product vendors will be working with
OWASP to produce a strong list of requirements for all of web
application security.

:\* Reference Architectures: We discussed the concept for this project
again, and examined Microsoft's Improving Web Application Security
(http://msdn.microsoft.com/security/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnnetsec/html/threatcounter.asp).
While an impressive effort, it seems like there is a need for platform
independent documentation that covers the threat, requirements, and
architecture levels, but doesn't go into the source code level.

:\* J2EE Filters: Jeff gave a bit of background on how J2EE Filters
works. Anil pointed out that this is very similar to how HTTP Handlers
work in the .NET environment. We then discussed the types of things that
J2EE Filters can do. Jeff showed how to write filters that implement a
request rate throttle, an input sanitizer, a certificate validator, an
SSL-only verifier, and several other functions. Some ideas raised by the
group included a logging filter and a filter to verify that responses
with set-cookie headers should only be sent over SSL.

**`Meeting``   ``Notes``   ``-``   ``10/28/04`**

This month we decided to meet in a conference room at [Aspect
Security](http://www.aspectsecurity.com), the chapter's sponsor. Aspect
was generous enough to provide sodas, chips, and the most delicious
brownies anyone ever tasted. Thanks\!

IMPORTANT: Future meetings will be on the fourth Tuesday of the
month--so the next meeting will be on November 23, again at 6pm. As long
as Aspect can reserve the conference room for us, we'll meet there
again.

Minutes: We tried to keep the discussion on three main topics:
whitepaper topics, a concept for a "webappsec dashboard," and J2EE
filters.

:\* Whitepaper topics: Jeff has a list of subjects he'd really like to
whitepapers about, but doesn't have time to write about himself. If
anyone would like to volunteer to write a whitepaper to be posted on the
OWASP site, [email Jeff](mailto:jeff.williams@owasp.org). Some of the
topics that sparked a lot of discussion and interest were:

:\*\* The asymmetric/broken market for security: Consumers can't
determine if software is secure so they won't pay more for the claim of
security; producers can't charge more for more secure software so they
don't make it more secure. How do we get vendors to write secure code?
How about for libraries--are the circumstances different? A related but
possibly separate topic is, who has the burden of proof--the developer
to prove software's secure, or the consumer to prove it's insecure?

:\*\* Secure web app architectures: How do you draw security or secure
web app architectures? We're not so good at telling customers where to
do security things in the data flow and n-tier diagrams. Can we do this
with UML? Data flow diagrams? How about a "reference architecture" for
authentication as an example? This may turn out to be a Chapter project.

:\*\* How to decide what to fix first: Is there a quick and easy way for
a company with a large number of web apps to determine where they should
begin with assessments? If they don't know about any vulnerabilities in
any sites, which do they look at first? Maybe we can come up with a
short questionnaire for each web app to risk rank them relatively, in
the style of The [Joel
Test](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html). This
may also become a Chapter project.

:\*\* Mechanisms, vulnerabilities, and threat models: How do people
threat-model attacks? Do they even do it? Could we create a standard
suite of threat models for any generic web app?

:\*\* Webappsec requirements: Are people putting security requirements
into their business requirements for projects involving web apps? Can we
create a standard list of security requirements people can paste in to
their project docs?

:\* Webappsec dashboard: The concern is that CISOs have no way to get
their arms around the state of web app security in their environment.
They need a sort of dashboard where they can see metrics and statistics
about all their web apps all in one place. Something like this may have
to be a tool/software, and OWASP really isn't in the business of writing
tools/software.

:\* J2EE filters: We didn't have time to discuss this but attendees were
interested so it will be on the agenda for the next meeting. Jeff
quickly demonstrated a tool to analyze JAR files and show what calls
they make.

:\* General discussion: More and more Local Chapters are springing
up--what kinds of things can chapters contribute? What should they be
expected to contribute?

**`Meeting``   ``Notes``   ``-``   ``8/25/04`**

Thanks to everyone who showed up last night to the first OWASP
Washington Local Chapter meeting. It was great to finally put some faces
to names, meet some local application security folks, and the Guinness
was nice too\!

IMPORTANT: Meetings will be on the last Wednesday of the month--so the
next meeting will be on September 29, again at 6pm. This time we're
going to meet in Columbia, MD at a place to be determined soon. If
anyone has a good suggestion about where to meet, please send it to the
list.

Minutes: We had some wide-ranging discussions that touched on scanning,
brute-force attacks, validation, web app firewalls, and new projects for
OWASP.

:\* Brute force attacks: We discussed some schemes for handling brute
force attacks on websites, some techniques for making a site hard to
scan (and why some scanners don't care), and we discussed the
combinatorics of generating productive password lists. We also got a
demo of Matt Fisher's password generation utility.

:\* OWASP and awareness: We had a long discussion about things that
OWASP can do to help raise awareness about web application security.
Some promising approaches included making some webinars and offering
them on the website, and providing more practical stuff (tools,
libraries, templates) and not focusing on the academic.

:\* OWASP image: We discussed some ways that OWASP could build on the
"platform" provided by the new portal. We could move the webappsec list
to OWASP from sourceforge, maybe create some different lists (newbie,
advanced, SQL injection, etc.). We could create some discussion forums.

:\* Metrics: We talked about the new metrics project and what kinds of
metrics would be the most useful to the appsec community.

:\* Promoting adoption: There were some interesting ideas about things
OWASP could do to advance the adoption of good appsec practices. One was
to get some buy-in from the FBI (a la SANS) or another high-power
agency. Matt Chalmers and Chris Burton are going to pursue a few leads
to see if there's interest.

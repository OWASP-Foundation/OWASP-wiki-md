"Owasp_logo_normal.jpg")At AppSecDC in 2009, the OWASP Broken Web
Applications (OWASP BWA) Project was announced and the first version of
the project virtual machine was released. The virtual machine provides a
standard set of web applications with various types of security
vulnerabilities and is well suited for use as a learning environment and
as a standard target for testing tools and techniques. This talk will
provide an update on the current state of the project and describe the
vision for the projectâ€™s future.

## Wireless Network(s)

Main point of contact: Filipe Lacerda

The current plan is to have 3 Wireless networks (with maybe the hotel's
used as a backup 4th)

1.  Attendees Network - this is the general access one, which will be
    used by all attendees. This is the one that will be hit the most and
    the one what will be protected and monitored by Trustwave
2.  Summit Team Network - this is a dedicated private network for the
    Summit Team. Access should be very limited and should have the
    maximum/strongest SLA (i.e. if one network cannot go down it is this
    one)
3.  CTF (Capture The Flag) Network - This will be a network that would
    contain all traffic related to CTF and other security research
    activities (it is an interesting question if this should be
    connected to the Internet, BUT, we might have authorization to
    perform 'ethical' security reviews to other Portuguese websites, and
    if so, all such tests should be executed via this network)

## OWASP Day

Since there are 'XYZ Day' for everything these days, shouldn't OWASP
have a DAY? We could either make it one of the Summit Days or pick
another relevant date (which we would celebrate every year)

  - The concept has been previously explored: [OWASP
    Day](OWASP_Day "wikilink"), but that was more of a 'synchronized
    OWASP Events around the world' model
  - the idea proposed is to have a fixed day of the year that we start
    to call from now on the 'OWASP Day' (and of course that this should
    be something that we celebrate and organize a number of events
    around it)

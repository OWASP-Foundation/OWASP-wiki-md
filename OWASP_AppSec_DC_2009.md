## 2 Day Training: November 10 and November 11

**Assessing and Exploiting Web Applications with the open source Samurai
Web Testing Framework**

This course will focus on using open source tools to perform web
application assessments. The course will take attendees through the
process of application assessment using the open source tools included
in the Samurai Web Testing Framework Live CD (Samurai-WTF). Day one will
take students through the steps and open source tools used to assess
applications for vulnerabilities. Day two will focus on the exploitation
of web app vulnerabilities, spending half the day on server side attacks
and the other half of the day on client side attacks. The latest tools
and techniques will be use throughout the course, including several
tools developed by the trainers themselves.

**Instructor: Justin Searle:** Justin Searle, a Senior Security Analyst
with InGuardians, specializes in penetration testing and security
architecture. Previously, Justin served as JetBlue Airway’s IT Security
Architect and has provided top-tier support for the largest
supercomputers in the world. In his rapidly dwindling spare time, Justin
co-leads prominent open source projects including The Middler, Samurai
Web Testing Framework, BASE, and the social networking pentest tools:
Yokoso\! and Laudnum.


**Java EE Secure Code Review**

The gut of any application lies in its source code. With the
ever-emerging landscape of threats and attack vectors facing today’s
applications, the need for secure source code has never been greater. In
this course, students will be working with actual web application source
code samples and discover how to pinpoint weaknesses, identify common
security flaws, and discuss corrective coding controls. Major
application security domains will be covered, including common
authentication and access control coding errors, session management
vulnerabilities, identifying injection flaws, and more. For anyone
looking to learn how to identify common security weaknesses in a code
base, this course is a must.

**Instructor: Sahba Kazerooni:** Sahba Kazerooni is Practice Lead of
Software Security Services. He has a strong background in Java EE
architecture and development. At Security Compass, Sahba leads the
Software Security Services practice which performs penetration testing,
source code review, and Threat Modeling of client applications. He also
plays a critical role in the development of curriculum for and delivery
of Security Compass training services. He has developed and taught
courses on various topics such as Secure Coding in Java EE, Exploiting
and Defending Web Applications, and Application Security Awareness. Mr.
Kazerooni is also an internationally-renowned speaker on security
topics. He has presented at conferences around the world including
BlackHat Security Conference in Amsterdam, Security Opus in San
Francisco, and IDC WebSec in Mexico City. Sahba delivers Java secure
coding training at the SANS Institute, the largest source for
information security training and certification, and has also provided
numerous presentations through ISC2 to their elite network of certified
information security professionals.

## 1 Day Training November 10

**Threat Modeling Express** The benefits of threat modeling at the
design stage are well-documented, yet few organizations are able to
perform this analysis technique due to time constraints. Based on our
experience in real world situations, Security Compass has developed a
one day approach to threat modeling .

In this class, students learn how to create a “quick and dirty”
application threat model using an organization’s most valuable resource:
its people. Students learn about the basics of web application security,
as well as learn about and perform a real hands-on Express Threat Model.
A deliverable template and list of steps will be provided as takeaways
for students.

**Instructor: Krishna Raja:** Krishna Raja is an Application Security
Consultant with an extensive background in J2EE application development.
He has performed comprehensive security assessments for various clients,
which involves threat analysis, source code inspection and runtime
penetration testing.

Mr. Raja has also been instrumental in the development and delivery of
Security Compass’ training curriculum. He has developed and taught
courses in Exploiting and Defending Web Applications, Application
Security Awareness and Advanced Application Attacks to architects,
project managers and developers across Canada and the United States.
Krishna is an emerging speaker at information security conferences, and
last year spoke at Source Boston 2008 and ISSA Secure SD Symposium.


**Foundations of Web Services and XML Security** The movement towards
Web Services and Service Oriented architecture (SOA) paradigms requires
new security paradigms to deal with new risks posed by these
architectures. This session takes a pragmatic approach towards
identifying Web Services security risks and selecting and applying
countermeasures to the application, code, web servers, databases,
application, and identity servers and related software. This course does
not require a laptop though a windows based machine is useful for
participating in exercises.

**Instructor: [Dave Wichers](User:Wichers "wikilink")**, [Aspect
Security](http://www.aspectsecurity.com)


**Applying the OWASP Testing Guide with the OWASP Live CD**

The OWASP Live CD provides the necessary tools to test web applications.
The OWASP Testing Guide provides a testing framework. You're testing web
applications currently, now what? Time to take your testing to the next
level. This class will offer information on how to use the OWASP Live CD
tools together for greater accuracy and speed, how to feed the results
of one tool into another, and how to automate the more tedious aspects
of web application testing. The training is focused not on what or how
to test, but how to get more out of the testing time you have. Lets face
it, testing time frames are always shorter then they should be, so how
can you squeeze the most into the engagement time you have. After
attending this training, you'll have some tricks in your bag to optimize
your testing.

**Instructor: Matt Tesauro:**

## 1 Day Training November 11

**WebAppSec.php: Developing Secure Web Applications**

Web applications are the new frontier of wide‐spread security breaches.
This tutorial will guide through development practices to ensure the
security and integrity of web applications, in turn protecting user data
and the infrastructure the application runs on. Several attack types
will be reviewed, along with how the proper development practices can
mitigate their damage. Although the tutorial targets the security of
PHP‐based applications, much of the content is applicable to other
programming languages as well.

**Instructor: Robert Zakon:** Robert Zakon is a technology consultant
and developer who has been programming web applications since the Web's
infancy, over 15 years ago. In addition to developing web applications
for web sites receiving millions of daily hits, he works with

  - Review & update OWASP Bylaws as needed. Current PDF version here
    [1](https://www.owasp.org/images/9/92/April2014OWASPFoundationByLaws.pdf)

Item 1: Review Bylaws Section 3.02 per Fabio email. Discuss if
appropriate to change. Vote as needed. Fabio recommendation: The
election terms needs to be reviewed in my opinion.. at present it reads
"An individual is limited to 4 consecutive 2 year terms” \>\> I think we
need to change the statement to the following “An individual (member?)
is limited to be elected no more than three terms in any 7 years
period”. By doing so we reinforce the message that you need to be an
OWASP member to run for the Board and also are limiting the scope in
amount of years which is quite currently long in my opinion.

Item 2: Carry-over from June 24 meeting. Review of Bylaws DRAFTv7 as
proposed by Andrew. [Bylaws

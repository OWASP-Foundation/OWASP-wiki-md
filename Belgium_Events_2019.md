### Program

#### CSP in the age of Script Gadgets

  - Speaker: Prof. Martin Johns (TU Braunschweig)
  - Presentation: not yet available

*Abstract*

Content Security Policy (CSP) was first introduced in 2012. It should
have been a silver-bullet defense against various injection attacks,
including the rampant Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities.
Unfortunately, modern development practices and legacy code bases proved
to be substantial obstacles. New versions of CSP were released to
address usability and compatibility for developers. Unfortunately,
researchers discovered many bypasses and vulnerabilities in real-world
CSP policies. The latest problem is known as script gadgets, where data
is turned into code by legitimate functionality.

In this session, we will take a look at the problems you might encounter
when deploying CSP. We start at CSP level 1 and work towards the latest
level 3 version. We discuss CSP's features, potential bypasses, and
pitfalls to avoid. In the end, you will have gained the knowledge to
deploy a secure and effective CSP policy.

Martin Johns is a full professor at the TU Braunschweig.

#### Zero to DevSecOps - security in a DevOps world

  - Speaker: Jimmy Mesta (CTO, Manicode Security)
  - Presentation: not yet available

*Abstract*

The way that software is being deployed is undergoing a massive
transformation. As a result, security teams are at a point where they
must adapt or be left in the dust. Traditional application security used
to be heavyweight and human-driven. Tasks are more often than not mostly
manual efforts. Time-consuming security testing often breaks down in an
automated world. Dynamic vulnerability scanning and manual code reviews
are incompatible with a world where code changes are automatically being
pushed to production hundreds of times per day.

This talk will share lessons learned from helping teams of all sizes and
maturity levels with their transformation to a DevSecOps model where
security goes from being a blocker to an enabler. Specifically, we will
cover some of the tools and processes you can start using right now.
These tools allow you to start adding real value to your organization
through enhanced visibility, vulnerability discovery, and feedback
loops. It is time to adapt and embrace a new era of security.

*Speaker Bio*

Jimmy Mesta is CTO at Manicode Security. He is a DevSecOps, Mobile, and
Kubernetes Secure Coding Instructor.

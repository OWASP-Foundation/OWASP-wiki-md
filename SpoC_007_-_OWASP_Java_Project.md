## Erwin Geirnaert - OWASP Java Project

### Executive Summary

I would like to help the OWASP Java Project to gather all Java security
related information and to document any domains that lack documentation.

### Objectives and Deliverables

The main objective I see is to gather all information in one place,
where security experts and developers can find the information they
need. In order to get there, I need to collect all information in the
OWASP Wiki, ask people if they want to donate it to OWASP so that we can
include it as public material, add URLs, white-papers, references to
books, ... And if time permits, write some documentation myself.

One deliverable is the OWASP Top 10 for J2EE applications with clear
examples of vulnerabilities and mitigations.

### Why I should be sponsored for the project

I have more then 10 years experience in Java and J2EE and the last 6
years I have tested and broke a lot of web applications. I gave also
some very successful J2EE security courses and web security courses. I
spoke at different conferences about application security in Europe. And
I am responsible for the security track at Javapolis, one of the biggest
Jave conferences in Europe. I am the co-founder of ZION SECURITY where
we do security testing, code review, design reviews, training,... I'm
also member of the OWASP Belgium board that started in March 2007.

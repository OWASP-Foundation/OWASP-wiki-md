### The OWASP Security Knowledge Framework

Over 10 years of experience in web application security bundled into a
single application.
The Security Knowledge Framework is a vital asset to the coding toolkit
of you and your development team.
Use SKF to learn and integrate security by design in your web
application.

SKF is an open source security knowledgebase including manageble
projects with checklists and best practice code examples in multiple
programming languages showing
you how to prevent hackers gaining access and running exploits on your
application.
<b>We will be talking about:</b>

  - Training your developers in writing secure code
  - Security support pre-development (Security by design, early feedback
    of possible security issues)
  - Security support post-development(Double check your code by means of
    the OWASP ASVS checklists )
  - Code examples for secure coding

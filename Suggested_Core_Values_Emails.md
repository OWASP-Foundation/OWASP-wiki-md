**Suggested Core Values and Definitions From December 16 to 21**

## Jeff - December 16 Email

1.      OWASP is not for sale  (integrity, not-for-profit, no commercial
influence)

2.      Anyone anywhere can participate in anything at OWASP (global,
open)

3.      Everything at OWASP is radically transparent

4.      Experimentation is a way of life at OWASP (game changers,
radical ideas)

5.      At OWASP we behave ethically and treat others with respect

I’ve really tried to focus on the “inspire and guide” as well as the
“who we are” criteria.

## Dinis - December 17 Email

The only thing I would like to add is that the 1st value in this list
should be 'Open Source Community' and every other value that is part of
that global 'value' should be in there (like Jeff's points number 1, 2,
3 and 5) 

## Matt - December 17 Email

My slight re-work to Jeff's email:

1\.      Integrity
Def: OWASP is not for sale.  It is a not-for-profit organization
designed to be free of no commercial influence

2\.      Global or maybe world-wide
Def:  Anyone anywhere is open to participate in the community at OWASP

3\.      Open or maybe Transparency
Def: Everything done at OWASP is radically transparent, both what we do
and how we do it

4\.      Experimentation
Def: Experimentation is a way of life at OWASP where efforts are
rewarded

5\.      Respect or maybe ethics (?)
Def: At OWASP we behave ethically and treat others with respect

2\.      Global or maybe world-wide -
<span style="background-color:yellow;">GLOBAL is better for me</span>

3\.      Open or maybe Transparency -
<span style="background-color:yellow;">I Like Open as in OWASP</span>
Def: Everything done at OWASP is radically transparent, both what we do
and how we do it

4\.      Experimentation
Def: Experimentation is a way of life at OWASP where efforts are
rewarded <span style="background-color:yellow;">?? What does this mean.
Is it core? to five behaviour in terms of values</span>

5\.      Respect or maybe ethics (?)
Def: At OWASP we behave ethically and treat others with respect

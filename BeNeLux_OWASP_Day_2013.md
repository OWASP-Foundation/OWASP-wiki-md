### Key note: Inside the mind of the fraudster, by Jan Joris Vereijken (Chief Security Architect, ING)

*Abstract:*
When we talk about banking malware, we typically think of bits and
bytes: Zeus variants, field injections, Man-in-the-Browser attacks, or
forensic analysis of infected PCs. What is actually much more
interesting, is to understand what is driving the fraudster. He’s
doesn’t care about bits and bytes, he’s just in it for the money. If
we get into the mind of the fraudster, we can suddenly understand many
issues much better. We’ll see that authentication is irrelevant,
fraudsters don’t want to steal millions, that they hate the mobile app,
and many more surprising things your never realized were keeping our
poor fraudster awake at night.

*Bio:*
**Jan Joris Vereijken** holds a Ph.D. in Computing Science from the
Eindhoven University of Technology, where he worked on algebraic
protocol verification. After a brief stint at Bell Laboratories to work
on Software Engineering, he moved to ING, the Dutch banking
conglomerate.
In his current role as Chief Security Architect, he is responsible for
the security architecture in the 35-odd countries where ING has banking
operations.

### Remote code exection in WordPress: an analysis, by Tom Van Goethem (PhD Researcher, University of Leuven)

*Abstract:*
With over 13 million downloads, WordPress is one of the most popular
open source blog platforms and content management systems. One of its
key features is the installation of plugins. These are developed by
third parties, but WordPress has to maintain its legacy codebase in
order to remain compatible with these plugins. As this codebase makes
use of unsafe functions, vulnerabilities may arise, affecting thousands
websites - if not more. This presentation will focus on a vulnerability
that has been present in WordPress versions up to September 2013. This
vulnerability, which may lead to Remote Code Execution, was found by a
simple combination of two publicly known elements: PHP Object Injection
and unexpected behaviour of MySQL regarding Unicode characters.

*Bio:*
**Tom Van Goethem** is passionate about web security. After getting a
master's degree of Applied Informatics, he enrolled in a PhD at the
University of Leuven. As a student with a chronic drinking problem, he
still found some time to hunt bugs for fun (and profit).

### Getting a handle on SharePoint security complexity, by Jan Philipp (Solutions Consultant Security, n.runs) and Alexios Fakos (Principal IT Security Consultant, n.runs)

*Abstract:*
This presentation’s main goal is to provide decision makers, architects,
administrators and developers with a comprehensive SharePoint security
overview. We will introduce a SharePoint security model applicable to
SharePoint versions 2010 and 2013. Then we will take a closer look at
the use of different types of security principals and their effective
use. This will be followed by covering security aspects when
implementing and extending SharePoint to meet business needs and will be
emphasized by showcasing common security pitfalls with examples
throughout the presentation. This will be demonstrated with security
down to the “nitty-gritty” details based on actual use cases and tips
and pitfalls that have been encountered during security assessments and
implementation of SharePoint solutions.

companies. He has been involved with SharePoint technologies from their
inception with Digital Dashboards throughout their many development
changes (TeamSpaces, MOSS etc.) to the present day SharePoint and
SharePoint Live versions.
**Alexios Fakos** (CRISC, CSSLP) began his career in development as a
Software Engineer back in 1999. After seven years of inspired insights
in the software industry he joined n.runs to be part of the security
team. Alexios is leading n.runs SDL services and he is since 2008 part
of the German OWASP chapter. Alexios held presentations at OWASP AppSec
US and Germany.

code review and the technology to support it. The takeaways from this
session are; Understanding the fundamentals problems that have to be
addressed to really get the benefits from using static analysis for code
review. Trends in code review. Best practices for code review. What the
future holds for code review.

### Everything you always wanted to know about web-based device fingerprinting (but were afraid to ask), by Nick Nikiforakis (Postdoctoral Researcher, University of Leuven)

*Abstract:*
Billions of users browse the web on a daily basis, and there are single
websites that have reached over one billion user accounts. In this
environment, the ability to track users and their online habits can be
very lucrative for advertising companies, yet very intrusive for the
privacy of users.

In this talk, we are going to describe web-based device fingerprinting,
i.e., the ability to tell users apart, without the use of cookies or any
other client-side identifiers. We will explain how device fingerprinting
works, who is using, for what reason, and how people are trying to
defend against it today.

### Turning your managed Anti-Virus into my botnet, by Jerome Nokin (Senior Security Consultant, Verizon Business)

*Abstract:*
Today centrally managed Anti-Virus (AV) solutions are used across all
enterprises and are relied upon to provide central management, logging
and enforcement. This talk presents the journey and the results of a
reviewing the security posture of the core components of a few selected
managed AV solutions, the central servers themselves. Critical security
vulnerabilities will be presented, covering SQL Injection, Directory
Path Traversal and Buffer Overflow. Particular focus will be given to
the different steps required to analyze both protocols and management
functionality and covers reverse-engineering, debugging and the creation
of fuzzing tools. Who does not want to transform a major managed AV into
his private botnet within minutes?

### TraceDroid: A Fast and Complete Android Method Tracer, by Victor van der Veen (Security Consultant, ITQ)

*Abstract:*
Tracedroid allows you to upload any Android APK file (i.e., an Android
app) for automated analysis. Tracedroid records the behavior of the
executed app, such as its network communication, the UI, but also its
internal function calls and Java code that is executed. To trigger the
app's real behavior, Tracedroid emulates a few actions, such as user
interaction, incoming calls and SMS messages, etc. - this will reveal
most malicious intents of an app (if any).
During this presentation, I will outline how Tracedroid is implemented
and how its stimulation engine performs in terms of code coverage. I
will also demonstrate how Tracedroid's output can help malware
researchers to gain a better understanding of unknown Android
applications during a live demo.
You can already give TraceDroid a try via

Malware’ for which he co-worked with the Andrubis team from Vienna’s
iSecLab. His interests are low-level system topics that enhance system
security, as well as reverse engineering and analyzing malicious code.

## OWASP Conference Sponsorship

Donation of a venue location or financial sponsorship or will help
defray the non-profit OWASP Foundation's expenses to prepare for and
hold these global conferences.

There are several different sponsorship options for conferences.

Two options are:

### Option \#1: Standard Sponsorship Plan (same as previous conferences)

  - Sponsor information will be presented on the main conference web
    page

<!-- end list -->

  - A Sponsor information sheet will be included in handouts to all
    attendees

<!-- end list -->

  - Sponsors can include a poster (no larger than 6 ft. x 4 ft. \[can be
    oriented either way\]) at the conference in the main hallway. This
    can be freestanding, or be hung from the wall.

<!-- end list -->

  - Includes 2 Free admissions to the conference

### Option \#2: Exhibitor Expo

  - Product vendors can demonstrate their application security products
    to conference attendees. The intended focus of this expo is to be
    prepared to discuss the technical details of the technologies they
    are offering in the market to help organizations deal with their
    application security issues. This expo should be light on sales push
    and very technical. OWASP attendees are very familiar with the
    application security market\!

  - At this time, we are not working with a provider of rental
    equipment. Please make arrangements independently if you need to
    rent equipment for the show.

Technical exhibit at your vendor booth:

  - We want to provide you an opportunity to meet technical consumers
    and allow them to interact and provide feedback for your product.
  - As such, each vendor should plan on using the table space to host
    two (2) workstations with running product. If you have more than one
    product you'd like to make available to the attendees, it's your
    choice as to whether both stations host the full spectrum or each
    one serves a unique purpose.
  - Attendees should be able to walk up with code/binaries on a USB
    stick, plug it in to the workstation, and get to the nitty-gritty of
    deploying a WAF, scanning code, pen testing the binaries, etc., etc.
  - For practical purposes, your workstations can certainly just be
    laptop machines. If your product is appliance/SaaS based, please
    ensure there are two workstations that hook up to your
    appliance/back-end so that attendees can still interface with you
    like everyone else.

Staffing your vendor booth:

  - Plan on bringing two sales engineers/technical employees to help
    attendees get a feel for the product(s) with which they're
    interacting. OWASP attendees tend to be on the very technical side
    of the spectrum, so there might be a few pointed questions thrown at
    your folks in the course of the event.
  - Attendance to the vendor area is basically free, so you're allowed
    to bring extra people to rotate folks out, etc., but please keep the
    vendor booths themselves populated by, at most, three folks at a
    time.

Communications with attendees in the vendor area:

  - OWASP will not provide an attendee list to anyone, nor will we be
    creating a mailing list for pre-conference announcements from
    sponsors.
  - Contact information for attendees should be exchanged as you and the
    respective attendee see fit.
  - Holding giveaway contests (drop your business card in the bowl to
    win an iPod, etc.) are allowed as long as they don't go way over the
    top in terms of detracting from the core purpose of the vendor expo.

The sponsorship fees vary for each conference.

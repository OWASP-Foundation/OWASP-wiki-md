![Owasp_logo_normal.jpg](Owasp_logo_normal.jpg
"Owasp_logo_normal.jpg")In this presentation I will discuss how the
Library of Congress has implemented their Secure Software Development
program. I will discuss the need for a Secure Software Development
Program and the steps that have been taken as well as planned activities
for the future of the Libraries Secure Software Development Program. The
benefits of automated and manual code review will be discussed as well
as specific examples of the Libraries implementation. Developer training
will be discussed and the need for security groups to work with
developers staffs in the issuance of useful practical guidance and best
practices and not just high level directives that are not seen as
useful.

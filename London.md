## Next Meeting/Event(s)

### Thursday, 28th November 2019 (Central London) OWASP London CTF For Developers

We are excited to announce the OWASP London CTF event.

CTF (Capture The Flag) is a type of computer security competition.
Contestants are presented with a set of challenges and puzzles which
test their creativity, technical (and googling) skills, and
problem-solving ability. Challenges usually cover a number of categories
and when solved, each yields a “flag” which is submitted to a real-time
scoring service. The difficulty levels are from beginner to advanced.

CTF tournaments are a great and fun way for software developers to learn
a wide array of applications security skills in a safe and legal
environment.

**PLEASE NOTE THE NEW LOCATION\!**

This event is kindly hosted and sponsored by: Empiric

**New Location**: Empiric, 1 Old Jewry, London EC2R 8DN

**Nearest Tubes**: Bank (3 minute walk), Mansion House (5 minute walk)

**Time:** Doors Open at 6pm for registration, pizza, drinks and
networking, the talks start at 6:30pm (we start on time).

The players will be presented with a series of vulnerable code
challenges that will ask them to identify the problem, locate the
insecure code, and fix the vulnerability. Hints are available (will
reduce the final score).

Programming languages supported in this CTF event: **Java, .NET, GoLang,
Ruby, PHP, Python, Solidity(Ethereum)**.

**IMPORTANT**: Please bring your own LAPTOP and a CHARGER for it . No
extra software required to be installed - play using just the web
browser.

Top 3 scorers will win exciting prizes generously provided by the cyber
security technology vendors.

Participation is FREE, but the number of seats is strictly limited and
registration is required to attend.

#### TALKS

  - **OWASP Introduction, Welcome and News - Sam Stepanyan, Sherif
    Mansour & Andra Lezza**

<!-- end list -->

  -
    Welcome and a brief update on OWASP Projects & Events from the OWASP
    London Chapter Leaders.

<!-- end list -->

  - **"\!Responsible Disclosure" - Dylan Wheeler and Sarah White**

<!-- end list -->

  -
    This talk discusses the hostile environments involved in reporting
    vulnerabilities and the lack of standardisation and laws protecting
    security researchers reporting vulnerabilities to vendors and
    organisations. Dylan and Sarah will present some real-world examples
    and outcomes and discuss common problems, such as what to do when
    there is no bug bounty program in place. The world of vulnerability
    disclosure can be treacherous, but if handled correctly it can be
    beneficial to all parties involved.

<!-- end list -->

  - **"Making Fact-Based Security & Risk Decisions (using OWASP Security
    bot & Data Science)" - Dinis Cruz**

<!-- end list -->

  -
    The way to create a modern and empowering security organisation,
    that both protects and empowers/enables the business, is to view the
    entire company and security ecosystem as a graph (where nodes are
    the multiple players and edges are the hyperlinked connections
    between them). This presentation will show real-world examples on
    how to use tools such as Jira, Slack, Jupyter notebooks, Lambda
    functions , Wardley Maps and OSBost to map and automate
    vulnerability and incident management workflows and ultimately
    empower the decision-makers by providing fact-based risk matrices
    and dashboards. This is the full version of the lightning talk
    presented at September 19th OWASP London meetup

<!-- end list -->

  -
    Please note that the following talk will not be delivered due to
    illness - we wish Chrissy Morgan a speedy recovery

<s>.\* **"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly of Responsible Disclosure" -
Chrissy Morgan**

  -
    So what has a JQuery bug that affected thousands of websites with
    one of the highest starred GitHub repos with 7,800 forks, a Domain
    Name Registrar vulnerability which allowed for full access to domain
    owner details (post GDPR) and data protection flaws within
    Microsoft's Office365 all have in common? ... Answer: Responsible
    Disclosure. This talk will feature disclosure on each of the bugs
    and others, the circumstances around these when reporting, to
    highlight the problems security researchers face today when trying
    to do the right thing and to raise awareness of the security flaws
    so we are better protected.

    The more we strive to connect every part the world with IT, IOT &
    ICS SCADA assets running on legacy and existing infrastructure with
    IPv6 and upcoming 5G & 6E. The risk of finding connected, insecure
    assets containing juicy info which can be leveraged by naughty
    groups rises. How easy is it to find vulnerable databases, solar
    panels, smart homes, washing machines, space IOT, maritime assets
    and critical infrastructure? Using OSINT Open source intelligence
    gathering, an important part of the reconnaissance phase of a
    application security penetration test. Learning what sources of
    information is available to start a penetration test is a crucial
    step in completing a thorough but effective exploration. Risks
    associated with leveraging, misusing or selling discovered material
    are all too real. Get your hoodie out and join us on a journey of

    The shift towards an API landscape indicates a significant evolution
    in the way we build applications. The rise of JavaScript and mobile
    applications have sparked an explosion of easily-accessible REST
    APIs. But how do you protect access to your API? Which security
    aspects are no longer relevant? Which security features are an
    absolutely must-have, and which additional security measures do you
    need to take into account? These are hard questions, as evidenced by
    the deployment of numerous insecure APIs. Attend this session to
    find out about common API security pitfalls, that often result in
    compromised user accounts and unauthorized access to your data. We
    expose the problem that lies at the root of each of these pitfalls,
    and offer actionable advice to address these security problems.
    After this session, you will know how to assess the security of your
    APIs, and the best practices to improve them towards the future.

    Have you ever wanted to learn more about how payments work? Do you
    want to know how criminals bypass security mechanisms on Point of
    Sales terminals, ATM’s and digital wallets? Payment technologies are
    a transparent part of our lives. They enable us pay for everything
    from a coffee to a car. In the first part of this talk we take a
    look at payment technologies past, present and future. Learn how
    payments have evolved and what transactions look like today.Next
    we’ll dive into the different attacks that are possible with each
    transaction type and discuss which areas security teams should be
    focused on now, and in the future. Learn how hackers gain access to
    banking endpoints, bypass fraud detection mechanisms, and how they
    ultimately cash out.

    '''
    ([PDF](Media:OWASPLondon_20190718_AdvancedBots_warburtr0n.pdf "wikilink"))

<!-- end list -->

  -
    Bots are generally seen as a bit of a nuisance and widely regarded
    as the weapon of choice for DDoS attacks. However, modern bots are
    capable of much more and are claimed to be behind three quarters of
    all attacks that hit web sites and APIs. Techniques such as rate
    limiting, IP blacklisting and even CAPTCHAs often do little to
    prevent the attacks as they evolve, evading controls which try to
    differentiate between bots and humans. In this session we’re going
    to look at what bots are and how they’re created, what they’re now
    capable of, which industries are most affected by them and how they
    are evolving to avoid our current defences.

    (ASVS) v4.0" - Andrew van der Stock (@vanderaj)*'
    ([PDF](Media:OWASPLondon_20190225_vanderaj_ASVSv4.pdf "wikilink"))

<!-- end list -->

  -
    Come learn about the completely new OWASP Application Security
    Verification Standard 4.0: what’s changed, what’s the same, and how
    you can use it for security architecture, agile security, secure
    coding and secure code reviews, unit and integration test cases, and
    now with 100% L1 support for penetration tests. The ASVS is the most
    comprehensive developer-focused application security standard,
    developed entirely in the open with contributions from all over the
    world. Over the last 10 years, adoption of the ASVS has become
    mainstream and it should replace the OWASP Top 10 in almost all
    situations. Learn how you can use the ASVS in your day to day life
    no matter if you’re a coder, a security professional, or a tool
    vendor. ASVS version 4.0 will be released at the nullcon conference
    on Friday 1st March 2019, so Andrew will really appreciate
    constructive heckling, calling him out on vague points or any help
    to make the final release presentation better.

  - *' "Introducing the OWASP ZAP Heads Up Display (HUD)" - Simon
    Bennetts (@psiinon)*'

<!-- end list -->

  -
    The OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is one of the world’s most popular
    and best maintained free and open source security tools. It has a
    powerful desktop UI, a highly functional API and is used by everyone
    from people new to security, including developers and QA, right up
    to professional pentesters. It’s also more complex for newcomers
    than we would like. We are therefore introducing a new Heads Up
    Display (HUD) interface which overlays data and controls for ZAP
    over the web based application being tested.

<!-- end list -->

  -
    When security incidents happen, you often have to respond in a hurry
    to gather forensic data from the resources that were involved. You
    might need to grab a bunch of hard drives and physically visit the
    data centre to capture data from the systems. Getting on airplanes
    and going to data centres means you have to get dressed, and that's
    a drag. When infrastructure is in the cloud, you have remote access
    and APIs for managing all your infrastructure, so you can respond to
    incidents with automation and do your forensic analysis in your
    bunny slippers. But is it as good as the capabilities you have in a
    data centre? Is getting dressed the price you have to pay for high
    quality forensics and incident response? In this talk Paco will
    explain the two major domains of cloud events (infrastructure domain
    and service domain) and describe the security and incident response
    techniques pioneered by AWS customers like Mozilla, Alfresco, and
    Netflix. He'll explain how to isolate resources to preserve the
    integrity of the data; get RAM dumps and disk image snapshots; and
    identify unauthorised changes to cloud resources using API tools and
    logs. And all of this while wearing pyjamas.

  - ''' "Developers - The Lucrative Target for Social Engineers" -
    Stuart Peck (@cybersecstu) '''

<!-- end list -->

  -
    Developers are a lucrative target for attackers, especially those
    with public profiles, active on social media, and working on either
    high profile application and open source projects. The recent attack
    against an NPM package with malicious code that targeted a popular
    Bitcoin wallet was subject to a social engineering attack, where the
    attacker was able to trick the maintainer to hand over ownership, is
    one of the many examples this is an ever increasing vector This talk
    looks to explore how exposed some developers are and the impacts
    this can have either through the supply chain and/or directly to
    organisations. During this talk will we will demonstrate and
    discuss: Open Source Intelligence- recon techniques; Profiling
    targets, repos, developer backgrounds, coding style, digital
    footprint; Pretext creation – building trust and establishing
    legitimacy; Example Vishing calls, phishing emails, and case
    studies; What developers can do to challenge and reduce the impact
    of Social Engineering

### Wednesday, 9th January 2019 (Central London) OWASP London CTF For Developers

OWASP London Chapter is pleased to announce the 2019 OWASP London CTF
Tournament for Application Developers.

CTF (Capture The Flag) is a type of computer security competition.
Contestants are presented with a set of challenges and puzzles which
test their creativity, technical coding (and googling) skills, and
problem-solving ability. Challenges usually cover a number of categories
and when solved, each yields a “flag” which is submitted to a real-time
scoring service. The difficulty levels are from beginner to advanced.
CTF tournaments are a great and fun way for software developers to learn
a wide array of cyber security / application security skills in a safe
and legal environment. Top scorers will win prizes kindly donated by the
cyber security technology vendors. Most programming languages supported.
IMPORTANT: Please bring your own LAPTOP and a charger for it to this
event

This event is kindly sponsored and hosted by Just Eat.

    In March 2017 hackers took three days to identify and exploit a new
    vulnerability in Equifax’s web applications. In the post-Equifax
    world, moving new business requirements (e.g., a non-vulnerable
    version of Struts2) into production in under three days might just
    be your new normal. Find out what the analysis of 17,000
    applications reveals about the quality and security of software
    built with open source components. Join this session to better
    understand how DevSecOps teams are applying lessons from W. Edwards
    Deming (circa 1982), Malcolm Goldrath (circa 1984) and Gene Kim
    (circa 2013) to improve their ability to respond to new business
    requirements and cyber risks.

    Web Storage, Indexed Database API and Web SQL Database allow web
    browsers to store information in the client in a much more advanced
    way compared to other techniques, such as HTTP Cookies. They were
    originally introduced with the goal of enhancing the capabilities of
    websites, however, they are often exploited as a way of tracking
    users across multiple sessions and websites. The presentation will
    be divided into two parts. First, it will quantify the usage of
    these three primitives in the context of user tracking. This is done
    by performing a large-scale analysis on the usage of these
    techniques in the wild. The second part reviews the effectiveness of
    the removal of client-side storage data in modern browsers.

    We no longer live in a world where ignorance on security is even
    remotely okay, you can't breach a data protection act with the
    defence that 'oops we didn't realise'. Not only will you owe major
    fines, but your reputational damage will be extravagant. Why is it
    then, in the media seemingly every day, an insane breach is
    reported? The reality is, we live in a world of fail by design more
    than security or privacy by design. The challenge is: \* Security is
    confusing, it is this confusion that leads to negativity and enables
    a shift to being a taboo topic. \* We need things to 'just work'
    across all situations, environments, and work consistently with a
    quick to market and competitive price. How did we get here? Well,
    let's face it, we created a no win market, that organisations can't
    possibly compete with. There is hope, as the world changes it's
    approach, which we are doing slowly, we can become a safer and more
    secure world. In this talk, we will be looking at how to make that
    first step in our personal and professional lives. Including the
    steps we can take to change the market to value us and our personal
    data.

    The Red Queen hypothesis, also referred to as the Red Queen effect,
    is an evolutionary hypothesis which proposes that organisms must
    constantly adapt, evolve, and proliferate not merely to gain a
    reproductive advantage, but also simply to survive while pitted
    against ever-evolving rival organisms in a continuously changing
    environment. Let's explore under a Cyber lens this evolutionary
    hypothesis in contrast to the evolving (cyber)threats and our
    adaptation (as professionals) to equally evolve our Cyber Resiliency
    capabilities (as an industry). This presentation is an opportunity
    to explore as professionals our security mindset and draw some
    personal conclusions on our Cyber Security culture in order to
    better ourselves. From user awareness all the way to Cyber
    Resilience, from developing by writing secure code to the effort it
    takes in breaking it, from gaps in hiring talents to hiring for the
    right reasons, this brief session is intended to spark a personal
    "eureka" moment in the mindmap of each security professional inside
    and outside the room.

  - *' "From zero to hero: building security from scratch" - Anthi
    Gilligan*'
    ([PDF](Media:OWASPLondon-Zero-to-Hero-20180830-PDF.pdf "wikilink"))

<!-- end list -->

  -
    Breaches mean financial, regulatory, legal, and above all
    reputational repercussions. Organisations are quick to react,
    however with security professionals in high demand and low supply,
    there has been an increase in individuals jumping on the
    “cybersecurity” bandwagon. In this talk, we discuss the pitfalls
    of the inadequately qualified “cybersecurity expert”, and examine
    the building blocks of a solid information security management
    system

<!-- end list -->

  - **"Smart Contract Security" - Evangelos Deirmentzoglou**
    ([PDF](Media:OWASPLondon-Smart-ContractSecurity-edeirme_-20180830-PDF.pdf "wikilink"))

<!-- end list -->

  -
    Dapps and many Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) run on smart contracts
    and tend to process a substantial amount of funds. This makes them a
    target, and therefore they often undergo attacks. Combined with the
    blockchain immutability, vulnerabilities undiscovered during
    development will exist forever in the blockchain. This talk will
    dive into the most common smart contract security vulnerabilities
    and provide in-depth knowledge on how these issues occur and their
    mitigation. Real world examples will be discussed and
    vulnerabilities like re-entrancy, overflows, gas limit attacks etc.
    will be demonstrated

<!-- end list -->

  - '''Lightning Talk: "Driving OWASP ZAP using Selenium" - Mark Torrens
    ([PDF](Media:OWASPLondon-OWASP-ZAP-Selenium-20180830-PDF.pdf "wikilink"))

<!-- end list -->

  -
    OWASP ZAP is great tool but it's not magic\! When used in a CI/CD
    pipeline, ZAP needs some help to discover the routes through a web
    application. Basic authentication, user logins and form validation
    can all stop ZAP in its tracks. I show how to drive ZAP using
    Selenium scripts and increase the security coverage of a web
    application.

  -
    Welcome and a brief update on OWASP Projects & Conferences from the
    OWASP Bristol and London Chapter Leader

<!-- end list -->

  - ''' "Application Hacking Through The Eyes of an Attacker" - Rob
    Hillier '''

<!-- end list -->

  -
    This talk will look at a capture the flag challenge which I enjoyed
    doing and found captured nicely an attackers mindset when they look
    at an application and chain vulnerabilities, it also give practical
    walkthrough of how to leverage them. It is a technical talk that
    will cover:

`- * Basic Application Reconnaissance`
`- * Using Local File Inclusion (LFI)`
`- * Attacking Flask (A python lightweight web server)`
`- * Exploiting Server Side Template Injection`
`- * Breaking out of a python sandbox`

  - **"Exploiting Unknown Browsers and Objects" - Gareth Heyes**

<!-- end list -->

  -
    Browsers are embedded everywhere, from popular applications like
    Steam and Spotify to headless crawlers, IoT devices and games
    consoles. They execute JavaScript but you don't have a dev console
    and some don't even allow you to interact with them. Many add custom
    JavaScript objects and functions but how can you discover all this
    hidden treasure without any dev tools? My talk introduces a new tool
    for your arsenal that allows you to inspect and exploit these
    unknown entities. The Hackability inspector is the missing offensive
    dev toolkit for security researchers.

#### SPEAKERS

**Rob Hillier**

  -
    Rob is a passionate senior security consultant working for XQ Cyber
    delivering web application and infrastructure consultancy to
    government and FTSE 500 organisations. He is a Check Team Leader in
    Infrastructure and also holds the OSCP qualification but mostly just
    loves the challenge of the technical aspects of security (Not only
    the breaking things but how to fix them too\!). When not working you
    will often find Rob playing CTFs, building labs (to break them) or
    sat on the beach waiting for enough wind to kitesurf.

**Gareth Hayes**

  -
    Gareth works as a researcher at PortSwigger and loves breaking
    sandboxes and anything to do with JavaScript. He has developed
    various free online tools such as Hackvertor and Shazzer. He also

    ([PDF](Media:OWASPLondon_20180222_Yuriy_Ackermann_FIDO_U2F_Auth.pdf "wikilink"))

<!-- end list -->

  -
    Today main 2FA solutions are OTP(TOTP, HOTP), RSA keys and SMS. All
    these solutions lack UX, security and privacy, easy to phish, and
    mostly not standardised. In this talk we will introduce FIDO U2F
    protocol, talk about its key strength, overview the protocol,

<!-- end list -->

  -
    In 1967 Barclays introduced the first cash dispenser to London. Some
    50 years later contactless payments and online transactions are our
    go-to methods to pay for goods and services. As we head ever closer
    to a cashless society, how relevant are threats to ATM’s today? What
    are the risks and the rewards? If a security professional or bad guy
    wanted to buy an ATM for research purposes, would it even be
    possible? We’ll show you how you can buy your own ATM for a lot less
    money than you may have thought. In this talk we’ll discuss the
    challenges of acquiring, moving and storing an ATM and just how easy
    is it to hack an ATM once you have it.

<!-- end list -->

  -
    Recruiting Cyber Security/Application Security candidates these days
    is not an easy task. How do you ensure that the potential candidates
    are going to make a difference to your organisation, become a part
    of the productive team and most importantly - have the security
    knowledge, skills and experience you need? CVs aren’t always a good
    reflection of a person’s capabilities. They can be exaggerated, they
    don’t always show a person’s true potential. In this talk Dinis will
    share his experience of using the open-source Capture-The-Flag style
    pre-interview challenges to drastically improve the hiring process
    of cyber security candidates.

    ([PDF](Media:OWASPLondon20180125_TLSv1.3_Andy_Brodie.pdf "wikilink"))

<!-- end list -->

  -
    Transport Layer Secure (TLS), a.k.a. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), is
    probably the most important security protocol used on the Internet
    today. This talk will cover the basics of TLS 1.3: the goals of the
    protocol and how it achieves them, what features have been added,
    removed and changed as well as talking through some of the
    (successful) attacks on previous versions that resulted in the new
    proposed standard. All online banking and payment sites as well as
    most popular websites and web services use TLS today, and the uptake
    is increasing as consumers demand more protection against both
    hackers and state agencies trying to monitor or interfere with

  - **Can DevSecOps Prevent the Impending Software Apocalypse? - Jeff
    Williams**
    ([PDF](Media:OWASPLondon20171130_3ways_of_Security_Jeff_Williams.pdf "wikilink"))

<!-- end list -->

  -
    When Marc Andreessen said, “software is eating the world,” he saw
    business literally reinvented as software. But as software is built
    faster, becomes more complex and interconnected, and handles more
    critical functions and data, it’s clear modern software has
    outstripped our ability to secure it. DevOps has produced stunning
    results for software speed and quality, but do they translate for
    security? In this talk, Jeff will present the “Three Ways of
    Security” – an interpretation of the DevOps classic, “The Phoenix
    Project” for security. You’ll learn how to get your security work
    flowing, how to create continuous security feedback, and how to
    create a culture of security experimentation and learning. Bring
    your hard questions – Jeff likes a “town hall” style meeting\!

    lesser known facts about well-known cookie attributes.This talk will
    give you a solid understanding of the pitfalls affecting cookie
    security, the risks associated with these, and how you can leverage
    modern security specifications to enhance the protection of cookies
    in your web application.

### Thursday, 9th November 2017 (Central London) OWASP London CTF For Developers

OWASP London Chapter is pleased to announce the 2017 OWASP London CTF
Tournament for Application Developers.

CTF (Capture The Flag) is a type of computer security competition.
Contestants are presented with a set of challenges and puzzles which
test their creativity, technical coding (and googling) skills, and
problem-solving ability. Challenges usually cover a number of categories
and when solved, each yields a “flag” which is submitted to a real-time
scoring service. The difficulty levels are from beginner to advanced.
CTF tournaments are a great and fun way for software developers to learn
a wide array of cyber security / application security skills in a safe
and legal environment. Top scorers will win prizes kindly donated by the
cyber security technology vendors. Most programming languages supported.

    Lewis Ardern**
    ([PDF](Media:OWASPLondon20170727_AngularJS.pdf "wikilink"))

<!-- end list -->

  -
    AngularJS is one of those wonderful frameworks that seems to hide so
    many of JavaScript’s warts. But while Angular adds much-needed
    features to the language, it also creates a handful of new security
    problems for developers to discover and work around. Lewis will walk
    you through an application that illustrates security issues
    discovered in real-world applications and will explain the problem
    with usable solutions.

    The OWASP CRS is a set of generic attack detection rules for use
    with ModSecurity (or compatible) Web Application Firewall (WAF) that
    saw a new major release in November 2016. CRS is the 1st line of
    defense against web application attacks like those summarized in the
    OWASP Top Ten and all with a minimum of false alerts. This talk
    demonstrates the installation of the rule set and introduces the
    most important groups of rules. It covers key concepts like anomaly
    scoring and thresholds, paranoia levels, stricter siblings and the
    sampling mode.

<!-- end list -->

  -
    Payment systems are part of our everyday lives, with most of the
    transactions performed through the use of a Point-of-Interaction
    (POI) device or a Virtual Terminal. Although payment terminals and
    virtual terminals make use of strong encryption and a secure
    communications channel, the Point of Sale (POS) is still a target
    for cyber-criminals. The malware affecting point-of-sale systems
    seen in previous years has demonstrated that criminals continually
    adapt to find ways to target card payment channels and keep the
    cycle going. This presentation however, attempts to go a step
    further and asses payment systems from a hypothetical attacker's
    point of view, by undertaking at threat modeling exercise against
    payment systems. The purpose of the threat modeling is to provide
    defenders with a number of scenarios (attack vectors) that it is
    possible to be used by attackers, while their activity remain
    unnoticed. One of the most important lessons of this Threat Modeling
    exercise was the discovery of a potential scenario that could allow
    cyber-criminals to shift from targeting Card Holder Data (CHD) to
    targeting the money directly,

  -
    A great number of Java applications utilize native Object
    Serialization to transfer or persist objects. Recently it has become
    popular the fact that the deserialization process in Java is flawed
    and if not used properly it can be easily abused by attackers. This
    talk provides an introduction and detailed overview of the problem
    of Java deserialization. You will understand the basic concepts of
    how Java deserialization exploits (gadget chains) work.
    Additionally, you will learn what solutions exist to the problem and
    the advantages and disadvantages of each. Finally, a new approach
    will be presented that protects the JVM from these attacks using a
    completely different approach than any other existing solution.

    time for security - Edwin Aldridge**
    ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIKHINswc8w))

<!-- end list -->

  -
    Within a large organisation different IT groups support different
    business areas. They typically use different technology stacks and
    operate different SDLCs. Small projects in particular have short
    development cycles and do not always have time to educate new
    developers in secure coding. This makes targeting of security
    education difficult and training which is not followed up by
    practice is quickly forgotten. The OWASP Cheat Sheets provide an
    concise source of sound advice but they can still leave the
    development team with a lot to do. They can be more complicated than
    necessary for a simple project. This lightning talk aims to sound
    out interest in an even more concise approach compared with OWASP
    Cheat Sheets.

<!-- end list -->

  -
    Many application security teams scramble to pinpoint vulnerabilities
    and flaws during the testing and release stages while managing
    limited security resources, a multitude of compliance regulations,
    and surprise feature requests. Although security teams try to follow
    the right application security practices, many applications are
    shipped with fragmented security. The most common denominator is the
    reliance on dynamic and static testing tools during the final stages
    of the lifecycle. In this session, learn about the benefits of
    building security during the requirements phase or the first stage
    of the software development lifecycle (SDLC).

    Double-Submit Cookie - David Johansson**
    ([PDF](Media:David_Johansson-Double_Defeat_of_Double-Submit_Cookie.pdf "wikilink"))
    (video: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uvrGQEy8i4>)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    Double-Submit Cookie Pattern Protection against cross-site request
    forgeries (CSRF) is a popular option in stateless applications as it
    doesn't require the server to store a token value between requests.
    Instead, the server will verify a token value stored in a cookie
    against a request parameter. Unfortunately, many popular
    implementations of this defense pattern can be defeated by attackers
    and this talk will discuss the misconceptions and pitfalls that may
    render this protection insufficient. We will look at how the CSRF
    protection in an AngularJS application using the popular Express.js
    middleware csurf on the server-side can be defeated. We will also
    show the options for configuring it securely.

    (video: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwobVQH6os>)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    PostMessage API is a known source of DOM XSS vulnerabilities on web
    sites. Browser extensions can use messaging too, and if an extension
    fails to handle incoming messages securely enough it may lead to a
    universal XSS. This talk will present an analysis of Chrome
    extensions that aimed at discovering vulnerabilities caused by
    insecure postMessage listeners in content scripts that are inserted
    by browser extensions into web pages. The research will demonstrate
    the examples of vulnerable Chrome extensions and explain the threats
    which they present to the end-users and how they can be mitigated.

    May Compromise Your Privacy - David Johansson**
    ([PPTX](Media:OWASP_London_2017-01-26_David_Johansson_Identities_Exposed.pptx "wikilink"))
    (video: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmchjwkYAOw>)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    Substantial effort has been put into the design of secure solutions
    for authenticating users. However, the privacy of end users has
    rarely been given as much attention in these solutions. This often
    leads to design flaws that let the identities of end users be
    exposed to parties they not necessarily intended to disclose it to.
    This talk will present a set of privacy requirements for protecting
    end users during authentication and show some examples of solutions
    where the end user’s privacy can be compromised because one or more
    of these requirements are not met. For example, we will see how
    design flaws in TLS client certificate authentication can be abused
    by attackers to identify users in both passive and active network
    attacks, and look at how the upcoming TLS 1.3 standard addresses
    this.

CTF (Capture The Flag) is a type of computer security competition.
Contestants are presented with a set of challenges and puzzles which
test their creativity, technical (and googling) skills, and
problem-solving ability. Challenges usually cover a number of categories
and when solved, each yields a “flag” which is submitted to a real-time
scoring service. The difficulty levels are from beginner to advanced.

CTF tournaments are a great and fun way for software developers to learn
a wide array of applications security skills in a safe and legal
environment.

This event is kindly hosted and sponsored by: ThoughtWorks London

    There are a huge number of technologies available to help us better
    secure our websites, but it can be difficult to know about all of
    them. In this talk I'm going to show you some of the headline acts
    in the HTTP Response Header category and just how easy it can be to
    quickly and effectively boost security and offer better protection
    to your visitors.

  - *' Achieving Secure Continuous Delivery - Lucian Corlan and Chris
    Rutter*'
    ([PDF](Media:OWASP20160428_Achieving_Secure_Continuous_Delivery.pdf "wikilink"))

<!-- end list -->

  -
    There's a lot of discussion around achieving application security
    automation within the development pipeline. In this talk you will
    experience an approach to using Threadfix and its "Policies" feature
    to determine the security exposure of a release and using a tool
    called Donatello to output the result back into the continuous
    integration and delivery flows. Additionally, the speakers will be
    presenting some of their ideas for a second version of Donatello
    which will be taking a lot more static & dynamic attributes into
    account in the form of an Application Security Passport.

      -
        Drones or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), have undoubtedly
        attained a prominent position in contemporary and future defense
        technologies. It has been increasingly used for Surveillance,
        Reconnaissance and have been planned to stop crude oil theft, to
        deliver online shopping products and even pizza. It remains
        important to understand their security and implication. This
        talk will explore different kind of drones and their associated
        vulnerabilities hence giving chance to audience to understand
        their flaws and work for anti-hacking solutions.

        The presentation will start with a history of ransomware from
        simple lockers to recent trends. Although currently ransomware
        follows good secure development practices, this is not always
        the case. We'll see in what circumstances we can get our files
        back and how. This will make you think twice before paying the
        ransom and, for some samples, think twice before clicking that
        tempting link for 'summer photos'.

      -
        Imagine a world where a developer can have her/his code pushed
        into production a few minutes after its checked in. How do you
        engrain web application security in such a development pipeline?
        How do you keep track of the security issues? In this talk we'll
        discuss some of the security challenges for this paradigm shift
        and how OWASP can help development teams navigate some of these
        challenges.
  - **New Era of Software with modern Application Security** - Video
    recording:
    [<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_RA-0RHKes>](https://youtu.be/0Stky7ubhfg)
      -
        This presentation will start with an overview of the current
        state of Application Insecurity (with practical examples). This
        will make the attendees think twice about what is about to
        happen to their applications. The solution is to leverage a new
        generation of application security thinking such as: TDD,
        Docker, Test Automation, Static Analysis, cleaver Fuzzing, JIRA
        Risk workflows, Kanban, micro web services visualization, and
        ELK. These practices will not only make applications/software
        more secure/resilient, but it allow them to be developed in a
        much more efficient, cheaper and productive way.

### Thursday, March 20th 2014 (Central London)

**Location**: Skype, 2 Waterhouse Square, 140 Holborn, London, EC1N 2ST

**Speakers**: Nikos Vassakis, Rodrigo Marcos, and Yiannis Pavlosoglou

  - **Using Tunna (HTTP Tunnel) for penetration testing - Nikos Vassakis
    and Rodrigo Marcos**
      -
        Once a web application is compromised and command execution is
        achieved, the attacker faces a number of hurdles. Network
        filtering is one of the key defensive techniques used to prevent
        attackers from creating further communication channels. This is
        usually an effective technique to limit the attacking avenues.
        Tunna is a tool designed to bypass firewall restrictions on
        remote web servers. It consists of a local application
        (supporting Ruby and Python) and a web application (supporting
        ASP.NET, Java and PHP). This presentation will cover all the
        steps required to effectively bypass firewalls protecting web
        applications, bind TCP ports on the compromised host and access
        other hosts in the DMZ.

<!-- end list -->

  - **OWASP WebSpa - Yiannis Pavlosoglou**
    ([PPTX](Media:OWASP_WebSpa_-_The_Concept_of_Web_Knocking_and_a_Tool_to_Go_With_it.pptx "wikilink"))
      -
        The OWASP WebSpa project is a tool implementing the novel idea
        of web knocking. The term web knocking stems from port knocking,
        If port knocking is defined as "a form of host-to-host
        communication in which information flows across closed ports"
        then we define web knocking a form of host-to-host communication
        in which information flows across erroneous URLs. In this talk
        we introduce web knocking and WebSpa: A tool for single HTTP/S
        authorisation requests. Similarly to traditional network
        port-knocking schemes, WebSpa aims to create a covert channel of
        communication for Operating System (O/S) commands, over the web
        application layer. Within this presentation the applicability,
        as well as the hurdles crossed while developing WebSpa will be
        discussed. The presentation will conclude with a video demo
        illustrating how a specially crafted URL will be responsible for
        allowing access to a previous closed TCP port 22 and other
        services.

  - **Pushing CSP to Prod: Case Study of a Real-World Content-Security
    Policy Implementation - Justin Clarke**
      -
        Widespread adoption of Content Security Policy (CSP) by most
        modern browsers has led many organisations to consider
        implementing CSP to thwart Cross-Site Scripting attacks in their
        web applications. In this session we will walk you through our
        experience successfully implementing CSP on our customer-facing
        web application, SendSafely.com, which relies heavily on
        JavaScript and HTML5. Our story will arm you with the knowledge
        you’ll want should you decide to go down the same path. When we
        initially decided to implement CSP, the BETA version of our
        website was already live. Like many sites, our platform grew
        from something we initially started as a pet project.
        Admittedly, building CSP into our site from day one would have
        been much easier...but not nearly as challenging or fun. We’ll
        start by walking you through our Content Security Policy,
        discuss the basic nuances between how each major browser
        implements CSP, and outline techniques for how we deal these
        nuances at runtime. Next, we’ll discuss the basic techniques we
        used for converting all of our classic “in-line” JavaScript to
        comply with the strict CSP that we developed. We’ll also talk
        about the not-so-easy task of getting third-party JavaScript to
        play nicely with CSP (cough, ReCaptcha, cough) and cover some
        edge cases we ran into related to the newer HTML5 APIs we rely
        on for certain tasks. Lastly, we’ll discuss what we learned from
        implementing a notification mechanism to report violations of
        our CSP at runtime. Needless to say we were surprised by what
        was reported, and we’ll share the results. Our hope is that by
        telling our story to the world, we’ll either save the rainforest
        or make your life a little easier should you decide to implement
        CSP (worst case scenario we’ll save you the trouble and dissuade
        you from even trying).

        application security processes within the organisations, OWASP
        sponsored a project in 2012 to develop guidance specifically for
        CISOs. The aim of the OWASP guide is to provide useful guidance
        to CISOs for effectively managing the risks of insecure web
        applications and software by planning the application security
        activities, investing in countermeasures to mitigate threats and
        considering the costs and the benefits for the organisation.
        Recognising that a CISO guide has first and for most capture the
        needs of CISO in managing application security from information
        security governance, risk and compliance perspectives a survey
        was developed in parallel with the draft of the CISO Guide. As
        the results of the 2013 CISO survey have become available, they
        have been used to tailor the guide to the specific CISOs needs.
        One of the most important aspects covered in the CISO guide are
        to making the business case for application security investments
        by helping CISOs in translating technical risks such as the
        OWASP top ten into business impacts, compliance with standards
        and regulations and risk management. Specifically the version of
        the guide that is presented at OWASP AppSec USA will be the
        first version that highlights the results of the CISO survey and
        seek to introduce CISOs to projects/resources that can help them
        in rolling out an application security program whose main goal
        is managing web application security risks.

  - **IAST: Runtime Code & Data Security Analysis – Beyond SAST/DAST -
    Ofer Maor**
      -
        Until recently, SAST/DAST dominated the application security
        testing market, each with its own pros and cons. We present
        IAST, a new approach, analysing code execution, memory and data
        in runtime, allowing for accurate inspection of the application.
        The presentation will present the basic IAST technology building
        blocks and their benefits, followed by discussing advanced IAST
        data analysis capabilities, which allow for a deeper analysis of
        the application and its business logic. We will discusses
        different approaches and implementations of IAST and Runtime
        code analysis, discussing the benefits of each. The presentation
        will include practical samples (including code\!) of how IAST
        can be used to accurately detect both simple and complicated
        vulnerabilities, including SQL Injection, Parameter Tampering,
        Persistent XSS, CSRF, and more...

  - **A Short History of The JavaScript Security Arsenal - Petko D.
    Petkov**
      -
        In 2006 we had the first JavaScript port scanner. The same year
        we saw the incarnation of more advanced tools such as AttackAPI,
        Carnaval and Backframe. A year later we saw several decent
        attempts to create complete security tools designed to run with
        nothing else but web technologies. That was just the start.
        This presentation aims to show the progress that has been made
        in the past six years in terms of security tools developed
        entirely with the help of browser technologies. The presentation
        will take you on a journey through the years, exploring some of
        the interesting attack techniques used in the past, bringing
        back some of the important discussions and eventually reaching
        the culmination when modern tools and technologies will be shown
        and explained.

### Thursday, May 10th 2012 (Application Security One-Day Conference - Free for OWASP Members)

**Location**: Bletchley Park, Sherwood Drive, Milton Keynes, MK3 6EB

**Time**: 10:00am - 4:30pm

ISSA-UK and OWASP are partnering for the first time to bring you a joint
application security training conference, free for members of OWASP,
ISSA-UK, or CSF. This unique event will attract attendees from both
ISSA-UK's traditional information security membership base, and OWASP's
web application specialists, bringing new thoughts and perspectives to
both groups. The theme of the day is, no surprise, application security.
We expect to focus on both methodologies and frameworks - such as
OWASP's top 10 - and a variety of custom tools and frameworks, from
open-source to proprietary. The goal is to deliver much needed tips and
tricks to attendees, something to tackle our ever increasing workloads.
Join us for a full day of application security tricks, tools and methods
at the historic Bletchley Park. After the day's talks are over, please
join us for a free tour of the famous WWII codebreaking facility\!

        We cannot hack or firewall our way secure. Application
        programmers need to learn to code in a secure fashion if we have
        any chance of providing organisations with proper defences in
        the current threatscape. This talk will discuss the 10 most
        important security-centric computer programming techniques
        necessary to build low-risk web based applications.

      -
        IronWASP (Iron Web application Advanced Security testing
        Platform) is an open source system for web application
        vulnerability testing. It is designed to be customizable to the
        extent where users can create their own custom security scanners
        using it. Though an advanced user with Python/Ruby scripting
        expertise would be able to make full use of the platform, a lot
        of the tool's features are simple enough to be used by absolute
        beginners.

  - *Implementing cryptography: good theory vs. bad practice - Viet Pham
    ([PDF](https://www.owasp.org/images/c/c5/OwaspTalkMarch.pdf))*

<!-- end list -->

  -
    Abstract: Cryptography is being widely implemented in software to
    provide security features. The main reason is that, many
    cryptographic mechanisms are mathematically proven secure, or
    trusted secure given some mathematical reasoning. However, to take
    full advantages of these mechanisms, they must be implemented
    strictly according to the theoretical models, e.g., several
    cryptographic mechanisms must be used together, in a specific manner
    to provide a desired security goal. However, without strong
    cryptographic background, many software developers tend to deviate
    from these models, thus making their own security software a gold
    mine for attackers. This talk gives examples to show why such
    situations exist, where do they spread, and how bad they may turn
    into.

    technologies - HTTP Strict Transport Security and and Pinning of
    Certs - Tobias Gondrom
    ([PDF](http://www.gondrom.org/owasp/presentations/OWASP_defending-MITMA_RHUL.pdf))*

<!-- end list -->

  -
    "In the recent months major trusted CAs providing trusted
    certificates for SSL/TLS in browser scenarios were compromised (e.g.
    seen in the Diginotar breach) and based on the current trust models
    (trusting all registered CAs equally for all domains) exposed vital
    web applications to the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks. Several
    approaches are currently discussed to mitigate this risk. The most
    advanced and closest to final adoption being the technologies
    discussed by the browser vendors at the recent IETF meeting in
    November in Taipei: HSTS and pinning of certificates. To better
    protect content providers against the distribution of bogus
    certificates, an HTTP header extension containing a fingerprint of
    their certificates linked to a domain address has been defined. This
    approach, which has been partly tested in Chrome, and already helped
    identify and protect to some extend Google's web application in the
    recent Diginotar compromise. Chrome users were able to detect the
    bogus DigiNotar certificates because Chrome had embedded the hashes
    of valid Google certificates. Back in July, the hacked DigiNotar
    certificate authority (CA), which has since gone out of business,
    was used to issue more than five hundred bogus certificates for
    companies including Google and various intelligence services."

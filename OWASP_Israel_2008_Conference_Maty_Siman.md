## Application Security - The code analysis way

From a security perspective, the source code plays a major role -most
security vulnerabilities can be tracked back to their source code
origin, and be fixed there.

Still, in the real world, frequently vulnerabilities in the code remain
uncovered as it is difficult to manually perform a full and accurate
code analysis - it requires hard to find resources and expertise. In
this technical presentation we will go through unique source code
examples that contain security flaws, and analyze together the
vulnerabilities, what techniques can be used to find them and what are
the best ways to fix.

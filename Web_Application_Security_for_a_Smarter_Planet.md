**Summary:**
An increasing intelligent, instrumented and interconnected planet is
highly dependent upon secure collaboration. Security managers worldwide
working for midsize and large organizations have been tasked with a
common goal: to better manage the risks associated with their
collaborative business infrastructure. Web application security plays a
significant role in achieving that goal. This session will discuss new
and emerging network and application security attacks, analysis from the
IBM Internet Security Systems X-Force research and development team's
latest X-Force Trend Statistics Report, and ways organizations can
protect themselves against Web application and network security threats.

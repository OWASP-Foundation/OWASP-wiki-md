  - GDPR

As for the GDPR, we as OWASP have a legal entity in Belgium. This is an
advantage, as thereby we do only have to the with the Belgian AP. With
Toreon, company of Sebastien Deleersnyder, we agreed to have an intern
helping us with the GDPR compliance with the backing of an experience
GDPR professional, for the data register etc..

  - OWASP Event Strategy

A Status update & Discussion on the OWASP Event Strategy. Here are some
***example*** questions we hope the strategy to cover:

  - How do we want to re-brand foundation run events to distinguish
    between regional events?
  - What type of events shall the foundation run?
  - What selection criteria are there for those events?
  - How will they be operated and managed between the foundation and the
    community?
  - What types of events can be run?
  - Which events are we planning for 2019?

<!-- end list -->

  - DPO

Furthermore, it is not required for an organization as OWASP to have an
DPO (Data Privacy Officer),but it is advised. We should discus about
this role, definition and should it be one of the board members. So we
would have another role, next to chair, vice-chair, treasurer and
secretary.

### Online training portal

We have been contacted from a professor of an university in the US. They
want to develop online material for their course on the cloudera
platform. He asked on what basis can they use available OWASP material.
Futhermore, Cloudera claims course material cannot be shared outside the
cloudera platform.

  - OWASP material is free to use, there is not limitation of using
    OWASP material to develop an online training
    We discussed to options of having the online training available for
    free via the Cloudera platform. Exam specific material is not public
    available.
    He volunteered to setup an call with Cloudera, who has a good
    standing about sharing knowledge, if they are willing to enable
    public shared OWASP training meterial via their platform

### Approval of 2018 Budget

<p>The OWASP CTF Project is designed to be used during (OWASP) conferences as an 'entertainment' to all the sessions that are available. Due to this nature, as it contains various challenges that allow participant to win prices at an event, the source code of the challenges is not disclosed, but the framework is publicly available. This framework is designed to be open for modification, extension so that people can use it as a base to hold their own CTF events.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The purpose of this Project is to create a competitive environment which can be used at conferences and to have fun and teach in a playful way the various mistakes which are made in regards to web applications.</p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>The OWASP CTF Project a web base hacking challenge application with challenges categorized in web, network and ‘others’. You require creativity, resourcefulness and networking skills to solve the various challenges. (a copy of the Live CD can help as well)</p>
<p><strong>Open Source?</strong></p>
<p>First of all... sorry, but of course, we can not make the CTF and all challenges opensource. Hereby my apologies for not being as open as I want OWASP and OWASP projects to be. ..I know you understand! Ahead of the OWASP AppSec-NY in 2009, the idea came up to supply an OWASP CTF event. This has been repeated successfully for the AppSec-EU 2009. Both developed by volunteering individuals, putting in a big amount of work, building the CTF from scratch. As the CTF event was warmly welcomed by those who participated, it was clear, the CTF has to become a event available for each OWASP event. To make this possible, the CTF project has been created!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, and I guess you understand, we can't share the current used CTF freely. For previous CTF applications and challenges, please see the download section. To get the CTF at your (OWASP) event, send an email to steven.van.der.baan 'at' owasp.org.</p></td>

# Playing the CTF

## Playing the CTF

The rules to participate and playing the CTF might change depending to
the event the CTF is organized at. What you find below is what we think,
the CTF should be done..

## Participating

Register at the CTF organizer with your MAC address and participant
name. Once you have access to the application, register with your chosen
game name and the game is started. You can join whenever you like when
the game has started until the declared end of the game.

## Rules

  - You play with your own laptop.
  - The game is open during the conference time.
  - Attacking the CTF outside of the challenges results in
    disqualification.
  - Attacking CTF competitors results in disqualification.

## Scoring

  - For each solved challenge you get one point.
  - Who has the most challenges solved wins.
  - By same score, first scored wins.
  - Groups and single player are treated the same
  - This is a proposal of rules. Those can be changed, depending on the
    event where the CTF is held.

## Who can anticipate in the CTF?

  - Single Players, every one can participate in a CTF event by
    themselves.
  - Groups, you can team up with others and participate as a group.
    Dividing the prices is the responsibility of the group members,
    though.

## Pointing System

  - With each challenge you can get a certain score, depending on the
    difficulty of the challenge. After solving a challenge, a key is
    gained. You will have to insert that key into your account screen
    and points are added to your account. In case of same number of
    points, whoever scores first wins.
  - With the current CTF system all challenges are worth one (1) point.

## Categories

The challenges are categorized in Web, Networking and Forensic.

  - Web challenges
  - Networking challenges
  - Forensic challenges

The current CTF contains the following categories:

  - Web; your "default" web challenges
  - Networking; networking related challenges
  - Others; all other challenges that can't be fitted under the other
    categories.

## Score Board

The scoreboard will display the ranking of all playing users.

# FAQs

  - Can I have a copy of the challenges?
    Short answer, no. Long answer, depending on the 'strength' of the
    challenges they will be reused across multiple Capture the Flag
    events. Releasing the challenges might bring an unfair advantage to
    some of the players.

<!-- end list -->

  - How can I help?
    Everybody can help by providing challenges, or ideas for challenges.

CTF is developed by a worldwide team of volunteers. The primary

# Road Map and Getting Involved

As of 2014, the priorities are:

  - Development
      - Framework

The framework is almost finished. The final quirkes are tested at the
Owasp BeNeLux days and will be uploaded afterwards.
The latest design and logo (thanks to my wife) are used, waiting on some
feedback from actual players.
The next version of the framework will contain a better template
mechanism for customisation and a construction to be able to play
network challenges without having to worry of you hackers taking over
the complete system ;)

  - Challenges

The various challenges that will be released depend on the feedback from
the various events where the CTF has been held. The easiest challenges
will slowly disapear from the CTF and will be made available for
download.

  - Obsolete

Involvement in the development and promotion of the CTF is actively
encouraged\! We need people who can help in designing and building
challenges. Feel free to send ideas (or even finished challenges) to
Steven (steven.van.der.baan@owasp.org) and he'll try to include it in
the CTF.

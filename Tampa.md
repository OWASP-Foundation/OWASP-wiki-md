interactive training session with a focus on the Domain Name System. 
We’ll begin with a primer on standard DNS operation, validating
concepts like resolution,  zone transfers, record types, ipv4, ipv6,
tcp, udp, multicast and anycast. Once a solid foundation is established
within the audience we’ll move into  DNS tradecraft from reconnaissance,
to man-in-the-middle, authenticated DNS and various forms of encrypted
DNS. Finally we’ll look into manipulation of DNS for exfiltration and
tunneling.  A lot of information in a small amount of time, please
arrive a few minutes early & sufficiently caffeinated for best results.

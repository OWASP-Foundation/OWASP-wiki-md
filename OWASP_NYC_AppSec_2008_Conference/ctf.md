Capture the Flag @ OWASP 2008 USA, NYC Sept 25th - 26th

## Contest Registration

There will be a registration booth at the conference for you to provide
your Name/Psuedoname/Team Name/handle and e-mail address. When the
contest opens, you will receive an e-mail with instructions and
passwords for accessing the contest web site. All questions on gameday
can be forwarded to Dan Guido, who will be on-site and will also
available by e-mail @ dguido@gmail.com. Registering for the CTF
competition does not force you to participate, feel free to register
just to have a look at the challenges.

## The Contest

The CTF competition is arranged into a series of 30+ mini-challenges
that each demonstrate a specific web application security vulnerability.
They are grouped into categories of Easy, Medium, and Hard each worth
100, 250, and 500 points, respectively.

### How do I know when I've solved a challenge?

The "answer" to most of the challenges are a string of random numbers,
an MD5 sum, or a SHA1 sum that you will recognize when you find. A few
challenges require you to deface webpages or other tasks. Those
challenges will specify how to know you're done.

### How do I redeem my answers for points?

E-mail your Team Name, your answer, and the URL of the challenge you
completed to dguido@gmail.com with \[OWASP-CTF\] somewhere in the
subject line. Submissions will only be accepted from the e-mail you
signed up with.

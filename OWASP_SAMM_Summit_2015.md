### OpenSAMM at HP, by Michael Craigue (HP)

*Abstract:*
HP uses OpenSAMM to assess the completeness of the security activities
in development groups, both in IT and in the business groups that create
our products. HP's internal Product Security group has developed the
SAMM Self-Assessment Tool, an implementation of the OpenSAMM process
wrapped into a portable ASP.Net MVC Razor application. Its aim is to
simplify the measurement of your organization against OpenSAMM, to
assist in the construction of a roadmap, and in the subsequent tracking
of progress down that roadmap. The tool is undergoing internal legal
review for release to the public, and we hope it will be ready for
release prior to the OpenSAMM summit. Mike will explain the motivation
for the tool and its capabilities, and will brag a bit about the
contributors who created it.

*Bio:*
**Mike** serves as Information Security Officer (ISO) for HP’s
Enterprise Group-IT. He also works with the EG business group which IT
supports. Prior to joining HP, he worked at Dell for 14 years, most
recently as the Director of Security Consulting and Portfolio
Governance. He holds a PhD from the University of Texas at Austin in
Higher Education Administration / Finance, and the CISSP and CSSLP
certifications from (ISC)². He’s been a contributor to the Cloud
Security Alliance’s Controls Matrix project, and a speaker at OWASP and
RSA conferences. His primary areas of focus are professional
development, software security, and information security policy
development. In his spare time, he taught Database Management and
Business Intelligence / Knowledge Management at St. Edward's University
in their MBA / MS CIS programs. He also enjoys cycling, cooking, and
learning the cello. <https://www.linkedin.com/in/craigue>

### Application Security? There is a metric for that\!, by Yan Kravchenko (NetSPI)

*Abstract:*
More and more, organizations’ security postures are defined by their
growing application portfolios, shifting the emphasis away from more
traditional security perimeters. The answer to virtually every business
problem large or small is “There is an app for that”, and the nature of
these apps range anywhere from simple workflow enablement tools through
large enterprise-grade applications. Managing security across all
applications is quickly becoming one of the biggest blind spots for
organization’s security programs, making it difficult to measure and
report metrics related to application security.
Over the past year, Yan has been working on a new approach to manage and
measure application security. By combining OWASP’s Software Assurance
Maturity Model, traditional risk assessment methodologies, and
experience developing security metrics, Yan developed a methodology that
may be used to help organizations improve the way they manage and
prioritize their application security initiatives. Once fully developed,
this approach will be donated to OWASP either as an add-on to the
existing SAMM project or as a new project intended to improve
application security management.
In this presentation, Yan will provide a detailed walk-through of the
overall methodology. We will provide examples of the types of metrics
and executive dashboards that can be generated by using this approach to
managing application security and help highlight various ways this
information can be used to further improve the overall maturity of
application security programs.

*Bio:*
**Yan Kravchenko** has over 18 years of IT and information security
consulting experience, the last seven with NetSPI. Before that, Yan
served as the Director of IT for a large agriculture company, and before
that Yan spent seven years performing Security Assessments, IT Audits,
and assisted creating Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Plans.
In addition to a strong understanding of security and compliance, Yan
has a deep technical background, which helps better evaluate and
understand security risks, as well as provide meaningful and practical
risk remediation advice. The last year, Yan has been focused on
developing a new methodology for companies to manage application
security, and improving information security metrics.

### OpenSAMM for the Masses: A Case for Cooperation, by Justin Clarke (Gotham Digital Science) & John Dickson (Denim Group)

*Abstract:*
We all know that behind every breach story in the press is an
organization that probably should have done more to build secure
software. Yet, organizations struggle mightily to focus resources on
building software securely from the outset and, as a result, software
security remains an after the fact “nice to do” and not a “have to do”
activity in many organizations. How can organizations determine the
right sets of activities or appropriate resource allocation levels that
it should undertake to adequately address software risk? Organizations
can make these determinations by benchmarking via OWASP’s Open Software
Assurance Maturity Model (OpenSAMM) framework. Yet organizations looking
to step up their software security game have encountered hurdles
standing in the way of fully utilizing the power of OpenSAMM as a
benchmarking tool. Justin and John will detail a broad industry effort
to address some of the hurdles by redefining certain aspects of the data
schema around OpenSAMM and providing more comparative data that will
open up this benchmarking tool for broader use throughout industry.

*Bio:*
**Justin Clarke** is director and Co-Founder of Gotham Digital Science.
Security consultant with extensive international Big 4 risk management,
security consulting and security testing experience. Based in the United
Kingdom, with previous experience in the United States and New
Zealand.
Lead author/technical editor of "SQL Injection Attacks and Defenses”
(Syngress 2009 & 2012), coauthor of "Network Security Tools” (O’Reilly
2005), contributor to "Network Security Assessment, 2nd Edition”
(O’Reilly 2007), as well as a speaker at various security conferences
and events such as Black Hat, EuSecWest, OWASP, OSCON, RSA and SANS.
Currently Chapter leader of the OWASP London chapter.
**John Dickson** is an internationally recognized security leader,
entrepreneur and Principal at Denim Group, Ltd. He has nearly 20 years
hands-on experience in intrusion detection, network security and
application security in the commercial, public and military sectors. As
a Denim Group Principal, he helps executives and Chief Security Officers
(CSO’s) of Fortune 500 companies and government organizations launch and
expand their critical application security initiatives. His leadership
has been instrumental in Denim Group being honored by Inc. Magazine as
one of the fastest growing companies in the industry for five years in a
row.

on and practical feeling of the OpenSAMM model.
In a first part, an overview is presented of the OpenSAMM model and
similarities and differences with other similar models are explained.
The different domains (governance, construction, verification,
deployment), their activities and relations are explained.
In the after-lunch session we will do an actual OpenSAMM evaluation of a

    security
  - Has 2015 and the recent spate of new attacks introduced any new

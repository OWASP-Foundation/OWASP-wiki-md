<p>The Secure Coding Dojo is a platform for delivering and tracking security training for developers. The platform is created for development organizations of all sizes: from small teams in startups or university classrooms to large enterprises.</p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>The Secure Coding Dojo is a training platform which can be customized to integrate with custom vulnerable websites and other CTF challenges.</p>
<p>Here are some of the features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integrates with Enterprise environments using Slack, Google and LDAP for authentication</li>
<li>It allows grouping of participants according to their development teams</li>
<li>It allows teams to track progress and compete with each other</li>
<li>Each lesson is built as an attack/defence pair. Developers can observe the software weaknesses by conducting the attack and after solving the challenge they learn about the associated software defenses</li>
<li>Predefined lessons are based on the MITRE most dangerous software errors (also known as SANS 25) so the focus is on software errors rather than attack techniques</li>
<li>The predefined hacking challenges are created for entry level and keep the developers engaged. Only a browser is needed.</li>
<li>With CTFs there is a puzzle aspect to the challenges which is great for pen-tester audiences but can make some developers lose interest. In the Secure Coding Dojo the focus is on demonstrating the vulnerability.</li>
<li>There are tips that help the developers as they are exploiting the issue to avoid getting stuck</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h2>
<p>As of <strong>June, 2019, the highest priorities for the next 6 months</strong> are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete the first draft of the Code Project Template</li>
<li>Get other people to review the Code Project Template and provide feedback</li>
<li>Incorporate feedback into changes in the Code Project Template</li>
<li>Finalize the Code Project template and have it reviewed to be promoted from an Incubator Project to a Lab Project</li>
</ul>
<p>Subsequent Releases will add</p>
<ul>
<li>Docker compose support</li>
<li>Refactoring to allow creating lesson plans for various roles.</li>
<li>A Security Code Review lesson plan</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="getting_involved">Getting Involved</h2>
<p>Involvement in the development and promotion of <strong>Secure Coding Dojo</strong> is actively encouraged! You do not have to be a security expert or a programmer to contribute. Some of the ways you can help are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try it out</li>
<li>Have your development team try it out</li>
<li>Submit feedback via Github issues</li>
<li>Submit pull requests</li>

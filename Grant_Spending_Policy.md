OWASP has grown considerably over the past few years, and this means
that our project inventory has grown as well. We currently manage over
100 open source projects under the OWASP brand umbrella. OWASP prides
itself on being able to spend resources in the pursuit of potential
grant funding opportunities for our projects. However, our recent
successful grant proposals have added several restrictions in the way we
can spend grant awarded funds as an organization.

In order to avoid any problems or mis-understandings, we have developed
a few guidelines to provide clear expectations of how grant awarded
funds are to be managed and spent by all OWASP Projects.

## Guidelines

1.  All grant applications submitted to a grant awarding body on behalf
    of an OWASP Project must be submitted to the OWASP Projects Manager
    for approval before they are submitted to the grant awarding
    organization.
2.  All grant funds awarded to an OWASP Project must be spent in
    accordance to the project plan and budget submitted to the OWASP
    Projects Manager, and the grant awarding organization, prior to the
    award of the funds.
3.  All expenses to be made using grant awarded funds must be
    pre-approved by the OWASP Projects Manager.
4.  Awarded grant funds may not be used, re-allocated, or given away to
    any other initiative or OWASP Project for any reason.
5.  It is the Project Leader’s responsibility to make sure he/she is
    working with the OWASP Projects Manager to manage grant related
    expenses and spending.
6.  It is the Project Leader’s responsibility to make sure they are
    delivering the product outlined in the grant proposal using the
    funding made available by the grant awarding body.
7.  In the event that the awarded project terminates its activities, the
    OWASP Projects Manager will notify the sponsor or grant awarding
    organization, and inform them of the cease of activity. The grant
    awarding organization can then decide to either take back the funds,
    or donate them to another project, to the general OWASP Project
    fund, or to another part of the OWASP organization that accepts
    sponsorships.

'''ABSTRACT:: ''' Separated By A Common Language

George Bernard Shaw said that about the US and England. And there’s
perhaps nowhere in Information Security where that is more true than in
Web App Sec. Though business people and geeks use a common language, we
don’t have a common understanding. It’s not what’s said; it’s what’s
heard that counts\! It’s not enough to just understand the words, the
listener has to understand the concepts and how they are put into
practice. This talk goes through these challenges on both sides of the
equation and gives a framework that can even give a CEO a working
knowledge of the OWASP Top 10.

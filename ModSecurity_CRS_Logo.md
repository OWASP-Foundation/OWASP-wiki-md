OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set

This is the logo of the CRS project created by Hugo Costa (hugo.costa@owasp.org).

The folder "source" contains the logo as provided by Hugo in PDF format.

The folder "uses" contains derived versions in xcf (gimp) and png format (+ 1 ico file).

The folder "uses" has the following subfolders:
* naked         Naked logo without any text
* CRS           Logo with large CRS beneath
* CRS-claim     Logo with large CRS beneath and the claim
* full          Logo with the full project title to the right
* full-CRS      Logo with the full project title to the right and a large CRS

The pngs are all coming with transparent background. All have some whitespace around
with the exception of the versions in the naked folder.

The png files are prepared in various sizes. Down to a size where the text is still readable.
There is an ico file in the naked folder.

Unfortunately, we do not yet have a vectorized svg version. I tried to vectorize myself, but
the colour gradient misbehaves. Hugo promised to deliver this too. Will probably take some time.

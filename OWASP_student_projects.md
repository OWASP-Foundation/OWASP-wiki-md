These projects require some research, thinking, and some hard work, but
I think they would be very valuable in getting students to really
understand software security. Please contact us at
[owasp@owasp.org](mailto:owasp@owasp.org?subject=Student_Projects_at_OWASP).

## Short Projects

1.  **[AppSec Principles](:Category:Principle "wikilink")** - do some
    research and flesh out one of the OWASP principles. Talk about how
    the principle works in general, and then examine how it is applied
    in various contexts.

<!-- end list -->

1.  **[Attacks](:Category:Attack "wikilink")** - flesh out the list of
    attacks, develop each one with content and links.

<!-- end list -->

1.  **[Vulnerabilities](:Category:Vulnerability "wikilink")** - work to
    fill out writeups of vulnerabilities and clean up the vulnerability
    lists. There's lots of linking to other articles here needed. We're
    integrating CLASP, CWE, Fortify, and other sources of
    vulnerabilities to make the best resource anywhere.

<!-- end list -->

1.  **[Countermeasures](:Category:Countermeasure "wikilink")** - general
    cleanup and linking of these articles. Probably some stubs in there
    that need significant writing.

<!-- end list -->

1.  **[Java Project](:Category:OWASP_Java_Project "wikilink")** - great
    opportunity to do research and bring together all the best
    information in one place for Java developers

## Long Term Projects (or Thesis)

1.  **[AppSec Metrics](:Category:OWASP_Metrics_Project "wikilink")** -
    this project is harder, but desperately needed. Could involve paper
    exercises or actual tools. Currently people stop at SLOC count.
    Build a tool that generates something like this label
    (http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Types_of_application_security_metrics)
    and it could get a lot of attention.

<!-- end list -->

1.  **Static Analysis to Pentest** - Write a tool that takes the output
    of static analysis and turns it into penetration test cases

<!-- end list -->

1.  **Security Test Automation** - Make WebScarab generate, record, and
    playback security test cases (think JUnit) so that you can do
    regression security testing

<!-- end list -->

1.  **Open Threat Modeling** - Build an open threat modeling tool like
    Microsoft's but not so ridiculous

<!-- end list -->

1.  **Data Flow** - Adding true data flow analysis to LAPSE. Check out
    the jDFA project at sourceforge to see whether that can be applied
    to find tainted data attacks like XSS and SQL injection (as well as
    others)

<!-- end list -->

1.  **Security Across the SDLC** - Integrated security activities across
    the lifecycle. Currently people are talking about “touchpoints” and
    “activities” but there’s no unifying line of sight or theme.

<!-- end list -->

1.  **Honeycomb** - It seems simple, but when you start trying to
    organize ALL the information that’s out there it gets incredibly
    difficult. The simple taxonomies are wrong, bad, and misleading.
    Honeycomb is using a folksonomy approach that I hope will allow us
    to do something new here. But it really needs someone to think it
    through – perfect for a thesis.

<!-- end list -->

1.  **Honeycomb+Tools** - Integrating the Honeycomb information into
    tools would be incredibly helpful. Things like the OWASP report
    generator need it. Threat modeling tools need it. Scanners need it.
    We need to prepare the information there for tool use.

## Participating

Many of these projects are research projects that will help students
develop their understanding of how application security works. Students
who want to participate should:

  - Choose an article topic from the Principle or Attack page
  - Contact owasp@owasp.org to get guidance on your project
  - Research everything you can find about that topic on the internet
    (and books)
  - Ensure that you’re not overlapping with other existing OWASP
    articles
  - Create a clear, well-organized, comprehensive article
  - You can't just copy other people's work -- you have to think and
    write in your own words
  - Be sure to link with articles you use and any other applicable
    articles

You can use the "talk" pages associated with each article to propose
ideas, ask questions, etc… Members of the OWASP community will respond
and guide your work.

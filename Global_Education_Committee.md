#### Major Initiatives

## **[OWASP Training](OWASP_Training "wikilink")**

The main goal of OWASP Training is to support Local Chapters' training
activities in a way that allows OWASP to use a model that,
despite specific and punctual adjustments, can be easily replicated and
become the main frame for all Chapter-led training events.

To know more about the OWASP Training concept, please see the **[OWASP
Training page](OWASP_Training "wikilink")**.

## **[OWASP Academies](OWASP_Academies "wikilink")**

The idea of the OWASP Academies is to conceive a frame under which work
should be done with Universities, Polytechnic Institutes,
IT Schools and other Academic institutions with a view to establish
solid relationships and develop with these organisms ways to
collaborate
and participate in the design of courses focused on web application
security.

OWASP has the knowledge and critical mass to give an invaluable input to
any Academy focusing on this area by:

  - contributing with its expertise in the definition of curricula and
    course contents that explore and study the web security field;
  - making available to the Academy its pool of interested and willing
    security experts as trainers.

To know more about the OWASP Academies and the activities developed,
please see the **[OWASP Academies page](OWASP_Academies "wikilink")**.

#### Committee Policies

  - [Global Education Committee
    Governance](Global_Education_Committee_Governance "wikilink")

#### Educational initiatives

**1. OWASP Education Project** OWASP project started by Seba

  - This project is about creating and managing (enabling off creation)
    educational material from the OWASP knowlegde base.
      - You could see this as the factory to create educational material

**2. OWASP Academies** pushed by Dinis and resulted into the OWASP
Academy Portal Project

  - project target is about offering an educational material, specially
    targeted for Universities and Educational institutions
      - you could see this as the shop for Educational material created
        within the Education Project

**3. OWASP Educational Supporters**

  - This is a membership program, especially for Educational
    institutions.
      - During (if I am not mistaken) the Summit 2008 there have been
        major changes in the membership categories.
      - A "Educational Supporter Membership" been created to enable easy
        commitment to OWASP for them\!

**4. OWASP Student Chapters**

  - This is a project, as it has not the means of competing with
    existing chapters
      - Different then regular chapters, we have a project as we need to
        keep them connected to OWASP. Say, they need more guidance /
        hand-holding.

**5.OWASP Student Members (proposed by Martin)**

  - As part of the Student Chapters, this is what we hope to achieve for
    the students being actieve\!
      - To lower the bar for students being committed to OWASP\!


**6. University Outreach**

  - as part of the summit, we started (or where trying to) the
    University Outreach.
  - you could see the student chapters, Academy portal and student
    membership as actions to get universities and educational
    institutions committed to OWASP.

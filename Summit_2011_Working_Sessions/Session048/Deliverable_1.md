## **Deliverable 1**

**A prioritized action plan for getting OWASP materials created in
Portuguese.**

*Concerns*:

  - there is need for a glossary (list of words and expressions) to make
    translations uniform.

*Action Plan*:

1.  Defined priorities
    1.  translations
        1.  Top 10
        2.  OpenSAMM
        3.  "About OWASP" presentations
    2.  revision
        1.  Quick reference guide
        2.  ASVS
2.  Coordination
    1.  assign a coordinator for the translation of each document
    2.  use the wiki to assign and control the translation of
        pages/sections/chapters/etc.
    3.  use the mailing list so people know the activities being worked
        on.
3.  Defined process
    1.  split documents in smaller chunks
    2.  allocate chunks to translators
    3.  verify how the work is going, ask for deadlines
    4.  maintain a waiting list of volunteers so we can re-assign chunks
        if needed
    5.  translation reviews must be done by a person from a country
        different from the translator

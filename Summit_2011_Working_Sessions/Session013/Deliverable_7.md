**Revised Election Process**

As a result of the [OWASP Governance summit working
session](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Summit_2011_Working_Sessions/Session013)
the following election process was defined.

  - Modify the board to consist of 6 members
  - Each board member will have a term of 2 years
  - Board members will be limited to three terms
  - Each year three board seats will be up for election
  - Every OWASP Member gets one vote
  - Any OWASP Member in good standing for the last 12 months may run for
    the Board

<!-- end list -->

  - OWASP will hold an election in 2011 for three board seats currently
    held by Jeff, Dave and Seba
  - In 2012 the seats for Tom, Matt and Eoin will be up for election

Some additional comments/concerns that were captured at the session

  - The by-laws need to be updated to reflect this change
  - A mechanism for breaking board bote ties needs to be defined
  - It may be more appropriate to have a process for nominating
    candidates for Board rather then allowing self nomination
  - The transition process needs to be clearly defined to ensure
    knowledge management in transition
  - A board member resignation is already handled by the existing
    by-laws
  - A graduated term was discussed in place of simple 2 year terms
  - It was suggested that the board be comprised of regional
    representatives
  - It was suggested that an "advisory board" be created consisting of
    former board members to perserve institutional knowledge
  - It was suggested that the board be limited to only a single member
    from any one company

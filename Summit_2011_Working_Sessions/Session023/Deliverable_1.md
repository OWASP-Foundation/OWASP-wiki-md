Outcomes: During the working session, the OWASP community overwhelming
asserted a preference to support message forums as a means of
communicating. Additionally, suggestions were made to explore community
servers and alternative home page layouts.

Since the Summit: Matt Tesauro has been working with RackSpace to
finalize their donation of five enterprise virtual machines to act as
OWASP servers. Larry Casey has several virtual machines configured for
OWASP services ready to be loaded pending finalization of the
arrangement. With these virtual machines in place, we will be able to
experiment with various services such as community servers and message
forums.

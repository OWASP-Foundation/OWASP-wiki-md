OWASP Licensing FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) -- Deliverable from
OWASP Summit meeting in Lisbon 2011
Disclaimer: The following is not legal advice. It is highly recommended
for a licensed lawyer to review your specific situation and ascertain
all relevant issues when selecting and understanding license
agreements.
1\. Who own the content and code submitted to OWASP?
a. The author of the submitted code or content owns the code. However,
the author submitting the creative work agrees to open source their work
under an approved open source license. The author also has the option of
completely assigning all rights in his work to OWASP. Under copyright
law the author of a creative work gains copyright protection once the
creative work is put into a tangible form.
2\. Can I take back from OWASP the code/documentation I had previously
submitted?
a. Technically no, because you open sourced your code/documentation.
However, you can fork your documentation/code and close source your
additional changes as the owner of the original documentation/code.
3\. Does OWASP require you to share back your changes?
a. It depends on the license associated with the code/documentation you
are modifying. Some licenses require you to share back any code changes
the instant you make then. Other licenses require you to use the same
license as the parent code/document which you used. Some are triggered
upon distribution and others are triggered on modification or use.
4\. What is the default license for information posted on the OWASP
wiki?
a. Creative Commons 3.0 SA Attribution
5\. Can you override the default license which OWASP runs under?
a. Yes, but you have to follow the directions in the license you are
selecting to abide by the selected license. If the license you selected
for your code/document does not include placement directions. Add a
license section in the header comments of a code file or the appendix of
a document.
6\. Which license should I use if I want to give enterprises free will
to build products on top of your submitted code or make and use changes
to your submitted documents?
a. BSD
7\. Which license should I use to control distribution, sale or
modification of the submitted code/documentation?
a. It depends on the limitations you want to enforce in your submitted
code/documentation. So read the license and talk to an attorney to
understand what you are getting into. Remember that the more restrictive
the license then the less likely that an enterprise will want to use
it.
8\. Is it possible to change my license after my document/code is
released to the public?
a. If you are the sole contributor for the document/code then you can
make changes to the license at any time. If there are multiple
contributors to a document or code base you will need go get agreement
for the license change from all contributors.

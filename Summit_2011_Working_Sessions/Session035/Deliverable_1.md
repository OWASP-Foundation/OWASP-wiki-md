## **Deliverable 1**

**Objectives and action plan to improve OWASP presence in Brazil**

The following objectives were defined for OWASP in Brazil:

1.  A new Chapter has been created in the city of Recife. Its two
    leaders are: Felipe Ferraz and Rodrigo Assad
2.  The Brazilian Chapters must be empowered through periodic meetings
    1.  Periodicity must be defined
    2.  The meetings must be promoted to the Brazilian AppSec Community.
    3.  The Chapter leaders must leverage the OWASP wiki and the
        specific mailing list to make the meetings happen
3.  The Brazilian groups and individuals that develop activities related
    to Application Security must be identified and contacted. Three
    categories have been defined
    1.  Government
    2.  Industry
    3.  Academia
4.  The Summit synergies must be leveraged to increase the collaboration
    with other Latin American Countries
5.  Boost the 3rd AppSec Brasil (1st AppSec LA) by the creation of an
    Latin-American organization committee focused in the local efforts
    to seek resources and event promotion. This committee should
    contribute to the success of the event.
6.  have a working session at AppSec Brasil to assess the outcomes of
    the item 3 above.
7.  Seek OWASP financial support to start the project
8.  Keep the efforts to approach industry, government and academia to

promote and empower OWASP.

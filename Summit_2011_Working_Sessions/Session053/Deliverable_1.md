## **Deliverable 1**

**Action plan for the Java Project**

1.  compile a list of OWASP projects related to Java (done in parallel
    to the other activities)
2.  define criteria so we can compare frameworks
    1.  use known vulnerabilities
    2.  use ASVS
3.  Reach frameworks to gather information on how they address the
    criteria items
4.  compile results
5.  replan based on the results

It was also decided to keep the Java project and the .Net project
aligned as much as possible.

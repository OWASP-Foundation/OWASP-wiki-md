## Deliverable 1

**A list of suggestions to pass along to the Global Connections Committe
for the best ways of engaging government.**

**The initial recommendations of the working group are as follows:**

  - OWASP should establish entities outside of the US that other
    governments will respect and be comfortable interacting with. Being
    a "US Only" entity legally is hurting the organization in terms of
    being able to really interact with governments outside the US.
  - OWASP should present simple, accessible, digestible and actionable
    programs and frameworks for the consumption of governments
    worldwide.
  - OWASP should look into partnering with other coalitions with similar
    goals and small standards bodies that already interact with
    government, and/or drawing best practices from these bodies.
  - OWASP should research the viability of liaisons to/from various
    government agencies that have an interest in working with OWASP.

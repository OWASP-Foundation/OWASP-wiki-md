## **Deliverable 1**

**Increase coverage and functionality of existing Output Encoding
Codecs**

1.  Ensure that existing codecs are working to specification for their
    context and cover all escaping and encoding rules for that context
    1.  Are there any new escaping rules for HTML5, ES5, or CSS3 that
        are not addressed by the current codecs?
    2.  Can we improve the MySQL Codec to account for additional modes
        of operation?
    3.  Is documentation on these codecs and when/where they should be
        used sufficient?

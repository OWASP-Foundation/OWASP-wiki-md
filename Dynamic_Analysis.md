Dynamic analysis describes finding vulnerabilities in a running
application, as opposed to [Static
Analysis](Static_Analysis "wikilink"). There are two main types of
dynamic analysis:

  - [Vulnerability Scanning](Vulnerability_Scanning "wikilink")
  - [Penetration Testing](Penetration_Testing "wikilink")

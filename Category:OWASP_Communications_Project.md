## Communications Overview

The purpose of the OWASP Communications Project is to communicate the
OWASP message about importance of Web Application Security to all
Business Owners, Project Managers, Application Architects, and
Developers in industry, government, and education fields.

The problem that has arisen over the life of OWASP has been that the
conversations have been amongst the 'converted' but hasn't been
communicated out to the general public. As a result, the message is
being scattered or not being understood properly. By organizing the
efforts around communicating OWASP's message, it should assist all
individuals, groups, and organizations that are affected by Application
Security.

In short, this project is about dealing with the 'business' of
application security. There are other technical projects active within
OWASP, but the knowledge of those projects is limited. This
Communications Project will give greater exposure to those projects and
help communicate their benefits.

This page is maintained by the [Global Projects
Committee](Global_Projects_Committee "wikilink") to help assist Project
Leaders with information about successfully running an OWASP Project. It
will be updated from time to time, and changes will be discussed and
announced on the OWASP-Leaders list.

### Quality Levels

For project releases, OWASP has created a criteria with three
designations of quality: Alpha, Beta and Stable releases. As project
releases move up the quality ladder from Alpha to Beta and finally to a
Stable release, the amount of rigour required increases. In general, the
project lead will determine the goal quality level of their project and
work towards fulfilling the criteria for that level. Once a project lead
has completed the prerequisites and criteria for the goal level, they
request that their project be reviewed. The quality level will determine
who reviews the release and how those reviews occur.

  - Alpha release: The review consists of the Global Project Committee
    (GPC) verifying that the project pre-assessment checklist is
    complete. Alpha release projects are the easiest to achieve since
    anyone with a start on a solution to an application security problem
    can self assess their project against the pre-assessment checklist.
  - Beta release: The project lead completes the pre-assessment
    checklist. Then, the review will first be conducted by the project's
    reviewer (more on this below). After the reviewer completes the
    review of the release, the GPC will validate the project's review.
  - Stable release: The project lead completes the pre-assessment
    checklist. Then, the two project reviewers will complete their
    review of the release (more on this below). After the reviews are
    complete, the Global Projects Committee and OWASP Board will
    validate the project's review.

Pre-Assessment Checklists versus Reviewer Action Items:

  - Pre-Assessment checklists should be completed by the project lead
    prior to asking for an assessment.
  - Pre-Assessment checklists were designed to be completed in minutes
    to verify that all items are complete.
  - Reviewer Action Items should be completed by project reviewer(s)
    after the project lead indicates the project is ready to be assessed
    and the pre-assessment checklist is complete.
  - Reviewer Action Items were designed to require some significant time
    commitment from the reviewer since the questions are subjective and
    require a good deal of understanding and review of the project's
    release.

### Prerequisites for Project Release Assessment

Depending on the quality level criteria, the project lead may have
prerequisites to complete before the project release(s) can be assessed
by the criteria below

  - Alpha release: No prerequisites.
  - Beta release: 1 reviewer is required.
  - Stable release: 2 reviewers are required. Second review has special
    requirements.

Notes on reviewers

  - Ideally, per project release, the project leader will propose the
    reviewer(s).
  - Ideally, reviewers should be an existing OWASP project leader or
    chapter leader.
  - If the project lead is unable to find the required reviewer(s), the
    Global Projects Committee can assist in identifying reviewers for
    the project.
  - It is recommended that an OWASP board member or Global Projects
    Committee member be the second reviewer on Stable releases. The
    board has the initial option to review the project, followed by the
    Global Projects Committee.
  - The Global Projects Committee confirms the assignment of reviewers
    to a project.
  - For special cases (e.g. large documents), multiple reviewers may be
    utilized to break the review work into smaller units. The
    over-riding principal is that one set of eye balls will review for
    Beta and two sets of eye balls will review for Quality. For example,
    a large project 4 reviewers could be used to do the Stable quality
    review were each reviewer would be responsible for reviewing
    approximately 1/2 of the content where 4 x 1/2 = 2.

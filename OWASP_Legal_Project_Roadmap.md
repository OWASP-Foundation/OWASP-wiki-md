The project's overall goal is to...

` Provide support to developers, software buyers, and software`
` sellers in the legal aspects of software security.`

In the near term, we are focused on the following tactical goals...

1.  Continue to develop the contract annex
2.  Create process activities surrounding sofware security contracting
    and acquisition
3.  Integrate the legal process activities into the overall OWASP
    process materials

Here are the current tasks defined to help us achieve these goals

  - Draft the process activity, "Reach agreement on software security"
  - Do a case study to evaluate the usefulness of the annex

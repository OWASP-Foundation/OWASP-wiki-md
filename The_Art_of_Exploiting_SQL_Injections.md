## Description

**Course Length: 1 Day**

This is a full day hands on training course which will typically target
penetration testers, security auditors/administrators and even web
developers to learn advanced exploitation techniques. SQL Injection,
although now nearly 15 years old, still exists in over 30% of the web
applications. This vulnerability could typically result in 3 scenarios:

1.  Authentication Bypass
2.  Extraction of arbitrary sensitive data from the database
3.  Access and compromise of the internal network.

To identify the true impact of this vulnerability it is essential that
the vulnerability gets exploited to the full extent. While there is a
reasonably good awareness when it comes to identify this problem, there
are still a lot of grey areas when it comes to exploitation or even
identifying complex vulnerabilities like a 2nd order injections. This
training will target 3 databases (MS-SQL, Mysql, Oracle) and discuss a
variety of exploitation techniques to exploit each scenario. The aim of
the training course is to address the following:

1.  Identify the most complicated sql injections which are beyond the
    scope of any automated tool?
2.  Identify and Extract sensitive data from back-end database?
3.  Privilege Escalation within the database and extracting data with
    database admin privilege?
4.  OS code execution on these database server and use this as a pivot
    to attack internal network?

## Student Requirements

Students will need to bring a laptop with VMWare

## Objectives

Skill: Basic, Intermediate

1.  Understand the problem of SQL Injection
2.  Learn a variety of advanced exploitation techniques which hackers
    use.
3.  How to fix the problem?

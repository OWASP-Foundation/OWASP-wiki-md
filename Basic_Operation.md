At each stage of an application security assessment, it is important to
understand the operation of the target.

This typically involves:

  - Examining client side content, such as HTML and script
  - Analyzing communications between the client and server
  - Reviewing cookies and other local data

The browser typically makes it simple to view HTML source. WebGoat
expands on that with operations to Show Params, Show HTML, Show Cookies
and Show Java.

Under normal circumstances the browser provides a feature to view HTML
source. For Microsoft Internet Explorer this is “Source” under the View
menu. For Firefox this is “Page Source” under the view menu. The Show
HTML feature of WebGoat shows only the HTML that is relevant for the
current lesson. This view does not include HTML for side and top bars.

Parameters and cookies display in red.

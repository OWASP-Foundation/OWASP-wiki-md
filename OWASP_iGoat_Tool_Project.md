<p>iGoat is a learning tool for iOS developers (iPhone, iPad, etc.). It was inspired by the WebGoat project, and has a similar conceptual flow to it.</p>
<p>As such, iGoat is a safe environment where iOS developers can learn about the major security pitfalls they face as well as how to avoid them. It is made up of a series of lessons that each teach a single (but vital) security lesson.</p>
<p>The lessons are laid out in the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Brief introduction to the problem.</li>
<li>Verify the problem by exploiting it.</li>
<li>Brief description of available remediations to the problem.</li>
<li>Fix the problem by correcting and rebuilding the iGoat program.</li>
</ol>
<p>Step 4 is optional, but highly recommended for all iOS developers. Assistance is available within iGoat if you don't know how to fix a specific problem.</p>
<p>iGoat can be downloaded here:Â https://github.com/owasp/igoat</p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>iGoat has been designed and built to be a foundation on which to build a series of iOS security lessons. The initial iGoat release will include a handful of lessons to work through, but one of the aims of the project is to build a community of developers to help build out additional lessons over time -- much as WebGoat has before it.</p>
<h2 id="licensing">Licensing</h2>
<p>iGoat is free software, released under the GPLv3 license.</p></td>

# FAQs

## How can I participate in your project?

All you have to do is make the Project Leader's aware of your available
time to contribute to the project. It is also important to let the
Leader's know how you would like to contribute and pitch in to help the
project meet it's goals and milestones. There are many different ways
you can contribute to an OWASP Project, but communication with the leads
is key.

## If I am not a programmer can I participate in your project?

Yes, you can certainly participate in the project if you are not a
programmer or technical. The project needs different skills and
expertise and different times during its development. Currently, we are
looking for researchers, writers, graphic designers, and a project
administrator.

## Getting Involved

Involvement in the development and promotion of Tool Project Template is
actively encouraged\! You do not have to be a security expert or a
programmer to contribute. Some of the ways you can help are as follows:

## Coding

We could implement some of the later items on the roadmap sooner if
someone wanted to help out with unit or automated regression tests

## Localization

Are you fluent in another language? Can you help translate the text
strings in the <strong>Tool Project Template</strong> into that
language?

## Testing

### Do you have a flair for finding bugs in software? We want to product a high quality product, so any help with Quality Assurance would be greatly appreciated. Let us know if you can offer your help.

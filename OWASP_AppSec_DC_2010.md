## 2 Day Training

### **Assessing and Exploiting Web Applications with Samurai-WTF** | [Course Detail](Assessing_and_Exploiting_Web_Applications_with_Samurai-WTF "wikilink")

Come take the official Samurai-WTF training course given by one of the
founders and lead developers of the project\! You will learn how to use
the latest Samurai-WTF open source tools and the be shown the latest
techniques to perform web application assessments. After a quick
overview of pen testing methodology, the instructor will lead you
through the penetration and exploitation of two different web
applications, including client side attacks on the browsers connecting
to those sites. Different sets of open source tools will be used on each
web application, allow you to learn first hand the pros and cons of each
tool. After you have gained experience with the Samurai-WTF tools, you
will be challenged with a third web application. This final challenge
will give you time to practice your new skills at your own pace and
experiment with your favorite new tools. This experience will help you
gain the confidence necessary to perform web application assessments and
expose you to the wealth of freely available, open source tools.

### **Leading an AppSec Initative** | [Course Detail](Leading_an_AppSec_Initative "wikilink")

In this two-day management session you’ll get an industry perspective of
application security, understand the key vulnerabilities to
applications, be able to analyze root cause, and provide practical and
proven techniques in building out an application security initiative.
This course gives executives and managers the education and practical
guidance they need to ensure that software projects properly address
security. The course is designed to provide a firm understanding of the
importance of software security, the critical security activities
required within the software development lifecycle, and how to
efficiently manage security issues during development and maintenance.
This understanding is reinforced through industry awareness, live
demonstrations of commonly found application vulnerabilities and
workgroup exercises allowing attendees to conduct capability assessments
and recommend improvement plans.

### **Remote Testing for Common Web Application Security Threats** | [Course Detail](Remote_Testing_for_Common_Web_Application_Security_Threats "wikilink")

The proliferation of web-based applications has increased the
enterprise's exposure to a variety of threats. There are overarching
steps that can and should be taken at various steps in the application's
lifecycle to prevent or mitigate these threats, such as implementing
secure design and coding practices, performing source code audits, and
maintaining proper audit trails to detect unauthorized use.

This workshop will enable students to test the security of web-based
applications from the perspective of the end user. Security testing is
especially useful since it can be done at various phases within the
application's lifecycle (e.g. during development), or when source code
is not available for review. The most common threats and their potential
impact will be covered (based on the industry standard OWASP "Top Ten").
Hands-on labs and demonstrations will be used to teach the tools and
techniques needed to remotely detect and validate the presence of these
threats.

## 1 Day Training

### **WebAppSec.php: Developing Secure Web Applications** | [Course Detail](WebAppSec.php:_Developing_Secure_Web_Applications "wikilink")

Web applications are the new frontier of wide‐spread security breaches.
This tutorial will guide through development practices to ensure the
security and integrity of web applications, in turn protecting user data
and the infrastructure the application runs on. Several attack types and
risks will be reviewed (including OWASP’s Top 10), along with how the
proper development practices can mitigate their damage. Although
examples covered are PHP‐based, much of the content is also applicable
to other languages.

### **The Art of Exploiting SQL Injections** | [Course Detail](The_Art_of_Exploiting_SQL_Injections "wikilink")

This is a full day hands on training course which will typically target
penetration testers, security auditors/administrators and even web
developers to learn advanced exploitation techniques. SQL Injection,
although now nearly 15 years old, still exists in over 30% of the web
applications. This vulnerability could result in (Authentication Bypass,
Extraction of arbitrary sensitive data from the database, Access and
compromise of the internal network)

To identify the true impact of this vulnerability it is essential that
the vulnerability gets exploited to the full extent. While there is a
reasonably good awareness when it comes to identify this problem, there
are still a lot of grey areas when it comes to exploitation or even
identifying complex vulnerabilities like a 2nd order injections. This
training will target 3 databases (MS-SQL, Mysql, Oracle) and discuss a
variety of exploitation techniques to exploit each scenario.

### **Java Security Overview** | [Course Detail](Java_Security_Overview "wikilink")

The course on one hand introduces the basic security solutions provided
by the Java language and the Java Runtime Environment, tackling issues
like the Java Security Architecture and the security services of the
Java Standard Edition. On the other hand it provides a comprehensive
introduction to Java specific security vulnerabilities. Besides the
presentations being continuously updated by the latest advances in the
software development industry and the most recent achievements of our
security research laboratory, attendees can learn how to use Java
security features and can examine and correct typical implementation
bugs in example source code snippets through a number of hands-on
exercises, prepared in a plug-and-play manner by using a preset VMware
virtual machine.

### **Software Security Remediation: How to Fix Application Vulnerabilities** | [Course Detail](Software_Security_Remediation:_How_to_Fix_Application_Vulnerabilities "wikilink")

This class teaches attendees how to fix security vulnerabilities in
existing software. It provides a mix of discussion of project concerns
for planning and managing remediation efforts with hands-on coding
examples fixing specific vulnerabilities. Attendees will learn how to
risk-rank vulnerabilities, estimate remediation tasks, perform coding
fixes for vulnerabilities and demonstrate the effectiveness of fixes
applied. The focus is on the practical: how to use limited resources to
make significant improvements to the security of target applications.
Code examples use the OWASP ESAPI Java and Microsoft Web Protection
Library. Many classes teach developers how to build secure code from the
ground up or teach security analysts how to test applications for
security vulnerabilities. This class teaches developers and security
analysts how to deal with their existing portfolio of insecure
applications.

### **Threat Modeling Express** | [Course Detail](Threat_Modeling_Express "wikilink")

The benefits of threat modeling at the design stage are well-documented,
yet few organizations are able to perform this analysis technique due to
time constraints. Based on our experience in real world situations,
Security Compass has developed a one day approach to threat modeling
based loosely on a Facilitated Risk Assessment Process (FRAP). In this
class, students learn how to create a “quick and dirty” application
threat model using an organization’s most valuable resource: its people.
Students learn about the basics of web application security, as well as
learn about and perform a real hands-on Express Threat Model. A
deliverable template and list of steps will be provided as takeaways for
students.

This years contests vary in length, challenges, objectives and the
skill-set of the participants. The goal of this year's ASDC challenges
are to include application security folks of all backgrounds from
developers to ninjas and to do so in a fun environment that keeps
contestants scratching their heads. Contestants have the option of
either participating in a more relaxed environment with shorter contest
length or going for the more intense route. Contests consist of:

# All our base belong to you

Contestants attempt to defeat multiple application(s) security
protections for the glory. These challenges are intended to stretch the
breadth and depth of contestants knowledge of AppSec and will call upon
a range of skills. Play alone or choose your team wisely :-)

## CTF Registration, Prizes and Rules

**Description:**

AppSec DC 2010 CTF will be a competition in which participants compete
for prizes in a test of Web 2.0 hacking skills. The contestants will
participate in real-world scenarios designed to simulate vulnerabilities
discovered in production applications. The competition will focus on
application security but participants should arrive ready with an
arsenal of skill-sets to complete these challenges. Mobile Security, Web
2.0, Web services, run-time assessments and much, much more will be
included.

**Rules:**

The contest begins on November 10th at 1pm and ends the next day,
November 11th at 1pm.

Competitors are allowed to team up with a maximum of three (3) other
contestants for a total maximum team size of four (4) participants. The
scoring system and any other system NOT designated as “In-Scope” is
considered OFF-LIMITS and any malicious activity towards or on those
systems will result in an immediate disqualification for the team from
which the participant(s) exists.

Contestants will use their own equipment to compete with but it is
HIGHLY recommended that contestants do not bring equipment which hosts
personal or sensitive data.

Scoring will take place via a web-based scoreboard portal. Teams will
have individual logins that will be required to submit points.

**Resources:**

Internet access will be offered at the conference as a means to obtain
tools necessary for the competition, but we recommend that you bring the
necessary tools to the event. We cannot guarantee access to all sites
via the standard convention network, and visiting some sites you would

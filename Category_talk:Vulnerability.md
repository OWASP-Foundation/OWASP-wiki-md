Wouldn't it be better to name this category 'problem types'? I'm not a
native English speaker so it took me quite some time to figure out, that
what is referenced within the concepts-documents as 'problem type' is
called vulnerability within this wiki. I'm to to clasp so I might be
wrong with this idea.

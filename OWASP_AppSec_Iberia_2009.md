#### Papers

## Accepted Papers

**A semantic web approach to share alerts among Security Information
Management Systems**

Jorge E. López de Vergara, Víctor A. Villagrá, Pilar Holgado, Elena de
Frutos, Iván Sanz

*This paper presents a semantic web-based architecture to share alerts
among Security Information Management Systems (SIMS). Such architecture
is useful if two or more SIMS from different domains need to know
information about alerts happening in the other domains, which is useful
for an early response to network incidents. For this, an ontology has
been defined to describe the knowledge base of each SIMS that contains
the security alerts. These knowledge bases can be queried from other
SIMS, using standard semantic web protocols. Two modules have been
implemented: one to insert the new security alerts in the knowledge
base, and another one to query such knowledge bases. The performance of
both modules has been evaluated, providing some results.*

**WASAT - A New Web Authorization Security Analysis Tool**

Carmen Torrano-Gimenez , Alejandro Perez-Villegas and Gonzalo Alvarez

*WASAT (Web Authentication Security Analysis Tool) is an intuitive and
complete application designed for the assessment of the security of
different web related authentication schemes, namely Basic
Authentication and Forms-Based Authentication. WASAT is able to mount
dictionary and brute force attacks of variable complexity against the
target web site. Password files incorporate a syntax to generate
different password search spaces. An important feature of this tool is
that low-signature attacks can be performed in order to avoid detection
by anti-brute-force mechanisms. This tool is platform-independent and
multithreading too, allowing the user to take control of the program
speed. WASAT provides some features not included in many of the existing
similar applications and hardly any of their drawbacks, making this tool
an excellent one for security analysis.*

**Connection String Parameter Pollution Attacks**

Chema Alonso, Manuel Fernandez, Alejandro Martín and Antonio Guzmán

*In 2007 the classification of the ten most critical vulnerabilities for
the security of a system establishes that code injection attacks are the
second type of attack behind XSS attacks. Currently the code injection
attacks are placed first in this ranking. In fact Most critical attacks
are those that combine XSS techniques to access systems and code
injection techniques to access the information.. The potential damage
associated with this type of threats, the total absence of background
and the fact that the solution to mitigate this vulnerability must be
implemented by systems administrators and the database vendors justify
an in-depth analysis to estimate all the possible ways of implementation
of this attack technique.*

**Web Applications Security Assessment in the Portuguese World Wide Web
panorama**

Nuno Teodoro, Carlos Serrão

*Following the EU Information and Communication Technologies agenda, the
Portuguese Government has started the creation of many applications,
enabling electronic interaction between individuals, companies and the
public administration – the e-Government. Due to the Internet open
nature and the sensitivity of the data that those applications have to
handle, it is important to ensure and assess their security. Financial
institutions, such as banks, that nowadays use the WWW as a
communication channel with their customers, face the same challenges.
The main objective of this paper is to introduce a work that will be
performed to assess the security of the financial and public
administration sectors web applications. In this paper the authors
provide a description of the rationale behind this work that involves
the selection of a set of key financial and public administration web
applications, the definition and application of a security assessment
methodology, and the evaluation the assessment results.*

**Building web application firewalls in high availability environments**

Juan Galiana Lara, Àngel Puigventós Gracia

*Every day increases the number of Web applications and Web services due
to migration that is occurring in this type of environments. In these
scenarios, it is very common to find all types of vulnerabilities
affecting web applications and traditional methods of protection at the
network and transport level, not enough to mitigate them. What is more,
there are also situations where the availability of information systems
is vital for proper functioning. To protect our systems from these
threats, we need a component acting on the layer 7 of the OSI model,
which includes the HTTP protocol that allows us to analyze traffic and
HTTPS that is easily scalable. To solve these problems, the paper
presents the design and implementation of an Open Source application
firewall, ModSecurity, emphasizing the use of the positive security
model, and the deployment of high availability environments.*

#### Speakers

### Keynote Speakers

## Bruce Schneier

**The Future of the Security Industry** Bruce Schneier is an
internationally renowned security technologist and author. Described by
The Economist as a "security guru," he is best known as a refreshingly
candid and lucid security critic and commentator. When people want to
know how security really works, they turn to Schneier.

His first bestseller, Applied Cryptography, explained how the arcane
science of secret codes actually works, and was described by Wired as
"the book the National Security Agency wanted never to be published."
His book on computer and network security, Secrets and Lies, was called
by Fortune "\[a\] jewel box of little surprises you can actually use."
Beyond Fear tackles the problems of security from the small to the
large: personal safety, crime, corporate security, national security.
His current book, Schneier on Security, offers insight into everything
from the risk of identity theft (vastly overrated) to the long-range
security threat of unchecked presidential power and the surprisingly
simple way to tamper-proof elections.

Regularly quoted in the media, he has testified on security before the
United States Congress on several occasions and has written articles and
op eds for many major publications, including The New York Times, The
Guardian, Forbes, Wired, Nature, The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists,
The Sydney Morning Herald, The Boston Globe, The San Francisco
Chronicle, and The Washington Post.

Schneier also publishes a free monthly newsletter, Crypto-Gram, with
over 150,000 readers. In its ten years of regular publication,
Crypto-Gram has become one of the most widely read forums for
free-wheeling discussions, pointed critiques, and serious debate about
security. As head curmudgeon at the table, Schneier explains, debunks,
and draws lessons from security stories that make the news.

Schneier is the Chief Security Technology Officer of BT.

## Jorge Martín

Jorge Martín is an inspector of the Spanish National Police, and
currently the Head of the Logical Security Group from the High-Tech
Crime Unit in the Comisaria General de Policía Judicial.

He his a Computer Systems Technical Engineer and since five years now
dedicates himself to police investigation in the technological area,
focusing his activity on crimes related to intrusions, different types
of attacks, malware creation and dissemination and other related issues.
He has also a large experience on the filed of computer forensics.

He has participated on different courses and conferences, both in Spain
and abroad. Regularly participates on training initiatives with other
law enforcement forces on different countries, several Interpol projects
about technological investigation techniques and on different European
Union studies on the obtaining and manipulation of digital evidences.

### Panel Speakers

## Justin Clarke

**Title**: SQL Injection - how far does the rabbit hole go?

**Abstract**: SQL Injection has been around for over 10 years, and yet
it is still to this day not truly understood by many security
professionals and developers. With the recent mass attacks against sites
across the world, and well publicised data breaches with SQL Injection
as a component, it has again come to the fore of vulnerabilities under
the spotlight, however many consider it to only be a data access issue,
or parameterized queries to be a panacea. This talk explores the deeper,
darker areas of SQL Injection, hybrid attacks, SQL Injection worms, and
exploiting database functionality. Explore what kinds of things we can
expect in future.

**Bio**: Justin Clarke is a co-founder and Director at Gotham Digital
Science, based in the United Kingdom. He has over twelve years of
experience in assessing the security of networks, web applications, and
wireless networks for large financial, retail, technology and government
clients in the United States, the United Kingdom and New Zealand. Justin
is the lead author and technical editor of "SQL Injection Attacks and
Defense" (Syngress 2009), co-author of "Network Security Tools: Writing,
Hacking, and Modifying Security Tools" (O¹Reilly 2005), and a
contributing author to "Network Security Assessment: Know Your Network,
2nd Edition" (O'Reilly 2007), as well as a speaker at a number of
conferences and events on security topics, including Black Hat USA,
BruCON, EuSecWest, OSCON, ISACA, RSA, SANS, OWASP, and the British
Computer Society. He is the author of the open source SQLBrute blind SQL
injection testing tool, and is the Chapter Leader for the London chapter
of OWASP.

## Dinis Cruz

**Title**: OWASP O2 Platform - Open Platform for automating application
security knowledge and workflows

**Abstract**: In this talk Dinis Cruz will show the OWASP O2 Platform
which is an open source toolkit specifically designed for developers and
security consultants to be able to perform quick, effective and thorough
'source-code-driven' application security reviews. The OWASP O2 Platform
(http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_O2_Platform) consumes results
from the scanning engines from Ounce Labs, Microsoft's CAT.NET tool,
FindBugs, CodeCrawler and AppScan DE, and also provides limited support
for Fortify and OWASP WebScarab dumps. In the past, there has been a
very healthy skepticism on the usability of Source Code analysis engines
to find commonly found vulnerablities in real world applications. This
presentation will show that with some creative and powerful tools, it IS
possible to use O2 to discover those issues. This presentation will also
show O2's advanced support for Struts and Spring MVC.

**Bio**: Dinis Cruz is the Chief OWASP Evangelist and a Security
Consultant based in London (UK) and specialized in: ASP.NET Application
Security, Active Directory deployments, Application Security audits and
.NET Security Curriculum Development. Since the 1.1 release of the .Net
Framework, Dinis has been one of the strongest proponents of the need to
write .Net applications that can be executed in secure Partially Trusted
.Net environments, and has done extensive research on: Rooting the CLR,
exposing the dangers of Full Trust Asp.Net Code, Type Confusion
vulnerabilities in Full Trust (i.e. non verifiable) code, creating .Net
Security Protection Layers and using Reflection to dynamically
manipulate .Net Client applications. Dinis is the current \[Owasp .Net
Project\] and \[OWASP Autumn of Code\] project's leader and the main
developer of several of OWASP .Net tools (\[SAM'SHE\], \[ANBS\],
\[SiteGenerator\], Owasp Report Generator, \[Asp.Net Reflector\]). Dinis
is a active trainer on .Net security having written and delivered
courses for IOActive, Foundstone, Intense School and KPMG . His latest
course is the two day training course \[Advanced Asp.Net Exploits and
Countermeasures, which was delivered at the Black Hat 2006 conference
and will be presented on the fortcomming \[OWASP AppSec Conference\] in
Seattle.

## Luis Corrons

**Title**: The Business of Rogueware

**Abstract**: The growth and complexity of the underground cybercrime
economy has grown significantly over the past couple of years due to a
variety of factors including the rise of social media tools, the global
economic slowdown, and an increase in the total number of internet
users. For the past 3 years, PandaLabs has monitored the ever-evolving
cybercrime economy to discover its tactics, tools, participants,
motivations and victims to understand the full extent of criminal
activities and ultimately bring an end to the offenses. In October of
2008, PandaLabs published findings from a comprehensive study on the
rogueware economy which concluded that the cybercriminals behind fake
antivirus software applications were generating upwards of $15 million
per month. In July of 2009, it released a follow-on study that proved
monthly earnings had more than doubled to approximately $34 million
through rougeware attacks distributed via Facebook, MySpace, Twitter,
Digg and targeted Blackhat SEO. This session will reveal the latest
results from PandaLabs’ ongoing study of the cybercrime economy by
illustrating the latest malware strategies used by criminals, examining
the changes in their attack strategies over time. The goal of this
presentation is to raise the awareness of this growing underground
economy.

## Dave Harper

**Title**: Empirical Software Security Assurance

**Abstract**: By now everyone knows that security must be built in to
software; it cannot be bolted on. For more than a decade, scientists,
visionaries, and pundits have put forth a multitude of techniques and
methodologies for building secure software, but there has been little to
recommend one approach over another or to define the boundary between
ideas that merely look good on paper and ideas that actually get
results. The alchemists and wizards have put on a good show, but it's
time to look at the real empirical evidence. This talk examines software
security assurance as it is practiced today. We will discuss popular
methodologies and then, based on in-depth interviews with leading
enterprises such as Adobe, EMC, Google, Microsoft, QUALCOMM, Wells
Fargo, and Depository Trust Clearing Corporation (DTCC), we present a
set of benchmarks for developing and growing an enterprise-wide software
security initiative, including but not limited to integration into the
software development lifecycle (SDLC). While all initiatives are unique,
we find that the leaders share a tremendous amount of common ground and
wrestle with many of the same problems. Their lessons can be applied in
order to build a new effort from scratch or to expand the reach of
existing security capabilities.

**Bio**: David Harper is the EMEA Services Director for Foritfy
Software, the market leader in the fast-growing area of Software
Security Assurance (SSA). SSA gives organizations the power to ensure
that their entire software portfolio -- whether develop internally or
acquired through 3rd parties -- is secure and free of vulnerabilities
that can be exploited by cyber attackers to steal valuable data and
cause mayhem. David is responsible for helping Fortify’s European
Customers establish Software Security Assurance programs to
systematically reduce application risk. David has extensive experience
of defining and implementing Secure Development Life-cycles, whether in
response to a security breach or as part of a PCI or other compliance
initiative. David has also worked as security consultant on large

## Miguel Almeida

**Title**: Authentication: choosing a method that fits

**Abstract**: Through the last five years, we, in the security field,
have been witnessing an increase in the number of attacks to (web)
application user's credentials, and the refinement and sophistication
these attacks have been gaining. There are currently several methods and
mechanisms to increase the strength of the authentication process for
web applications. To improve the user authentication process, but also
to improve the transaction authentication. As an example, one can think
of adding one-time password tokens, or digital certificates, EMV cards,
or even SMS one-time codes. However, none of these methods comes for
free, nor do they provide perfect security. Also, one must consider
usability penalties, mobility constraints, and, of course, the direct
costs of the gadgets. Moreover, there's evidence that not all kinds of
attacks can be stopped by even the most sophisticated of these methods.
So, where do we stand? What should we choose? What kind of gadgets
should we use for our business critical app, how much will they increase
the costs and reduce the risk, and, last but not least, what kind of
attacks we’ll be unable to stop anyway? This presentation will focus on
ways to figure out how to evaluate the pros and cons of adding these
improvements, given the current threats.

**Bio**: Miguel Almeida is an independent computer and network security
professional. He has been testing, reviewing and advising on information
security for the last ten years. His work has been focused on financial
institutions and it has included engagements where, for a broad view of

**Title**: OWASP TOP 10 2009

**Abstract**: The goal of the Top 10 project is to raise awareness about
application security by identifying some of the most critical risks
facing organizations. The Top 10 project is referenced by many
standards, books, tools, and organizations, including MITRE, PCI DSS,
DISA, FTC, and many more. The OWASP Top 10 was initially released in
2003 and minor updates were made in 2004, 2007, and this 2010 release.
We encourage you to use the Top 10 to get your organization started with
application security. Developers can learn from the mistakes of other
organizations. Executives can start thinking about how to manage the
risk that software applications create in their enterprise.

**Title**: Deploying Secure Web Applications with OWASP Resources

**Abstract**: Universities are key to making application security
visible and the need to educate software developers about application
security as an aspect of proper software development has never been more
important. In this presentation I will share how OWASP resources can be
used by universities to develop, test and deploy secure web
applications. I will discuss challenges that Universities currently face
integrating a pplication security best practices, describe how OWASP
tools and resources are currently used at New York University to test

## Martin Knobloch

**Title**: Thread Risk Modelling

**Abstract**: How secure must a application be? To take the appropriate
measures we have to identify the risks first and think about the
measures later. Threat risk modeling is an essential process for secure

## Javier Fernández-Sanguino

**Title**: Protection of applications at the enterprise in the real
world: from audits to controls

**Abstract**: Securing application development in the enterprise world,
where applications range from small in-house applications developed by a
small department to large applications developed through an outsourcing
company in a project spanning several years. In addition those
applications that initially where not considered critical, suddenly
become part of a critical process or those that were going to be used in
a small and limited internal environment suddenly get promoted and
published as a new service on the Internet. To get a better feeling of
what works and what does not work in the harsh world outside, this talk
will present examples of do's and dont's coming from real world projects
attempting to protect security applications in different stages: from
the introduction of technical measures to prevent abuse of
Internet-facing applications to source-code driven application security
testing.

**Bio**: Telecommunication Engineer by ETSIT-UPM, he is the sub-director
of the Grupo Gesfor Sub-direction of Logical Security and a university

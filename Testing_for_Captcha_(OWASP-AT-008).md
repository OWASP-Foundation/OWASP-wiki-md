## Brief Summary

CAPTCHA ("Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and
Humans Apart") is a type of challenge-response test used by many web
applications to ensure that the response is not generated by a computer.
CAPTCHA implementations are often vulnerable to various kinds of attacks
even if the generated CAPTCHA is unbreakable. This section will help you
to identify these kinds of attacks.

## Description of the Issue

Although CAPTCHA is not an authentication control, its use can be very
efficient against:

  - [enumeration
    attacks](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_user_enumeration)
    (login, registration or password reset forms are often vulnerable to
    enumeration attacks - without CAPTCHA the attacker can gain valid
    usernames, phone numbers or any other sensitive information in a
    short time)
  - automated sending of many GET/POST requests in a short time where it
    is undesirable (e.g., SMS/MMS/email flooding), CAPTCHA provides a
    rate limiting function
  - automated creation/using of the account that should be used only by
    humans (e.g., creating webmail accounts, stop spamming)
  - automated posting to blogs, forums and wikis, whether as a result of
    commercial promotion, or harassment and vandalism
  - any automated attacks that massively gain or misuse sensitive
    information from the application

Using CAPTCHAs as a CSRF protection is not recommended (because there
are [stronger CSRF
countermeasures](Testing_for_CSRF_\(OWASP-SM-005\) "wikilink")).

These vulnerabilities are quite common in many CAPTCHA implementations:

  - generated image CAPTCHA is weak, this can be identified (without any
    complex computer recognition systems) only by a simple comparison
    with already broken CAPTCHAs
  - generated CAPTCHA questions have a very limited set of possible
    answers

<!-- end list -->

  - the value of decoded CAPTCHA is sent by the client (as a GET
    parameter or as a hidden field of POST form). This value is often:
      - encrypted by simple algorithm and can be easily decrypted by
        observing of multiple decoded CAPTCHA values
      - hashed by a weak hash function (e.g., MD5) that can be broken
        using a rainbow table

<!-- end list -->

  - possibility of replay attacks:
      - the application does not keep track of what ID of CAPTCHA image
        is sent to the user. Therefore, the attacker can simply obtain
        an appropriate CAPTCHA image and its ID, solve it, and send the
        value of the decoded CAPTCHA with its corresponding ID (the ID
        of a CAPTCHA could be a hash of the decoded CAPTCHA or any
        unique identifier)
      - the application does not destroy the session when the correct
        phrase is entered - by reusing the session ID of a known CAPTCHA
        it is possible to bypass CAPTCHA protected page

## Black Box testing and example

Use an intercepting fault injection proxy (e.g.,
[WebScarab](OWASP_WebScarab_Project "wikilink")) to:

  - identify all parameters that are sent in addition to the decoded
    CAPTCHA value from the client to the server (these parameters can
    contain encrypted or hashed values of decoded CAPTCHA and CAPTCHA ID
    number)
  - try to send an old decoded CAPTCHA value with an old CAPTCHA ID (if
    the application accepts them, it is vulnerable to replay attacks)
  - try to send an old decoded CAPTCHA value with an old session ID (if
    the application accepts them, it is vulnerable to replay attacks)

Find out if similar CAPTCHAs have already been broken. Broken CAPTCHA
images can be found here
[gimpy](http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~mori/research/gimpy/ez/),
[PWNtcha](http://libcaca.zoy.org/wiki/PWNtcha), and
[lafdc](http://www.lafdc.com/captcha/).

Verify if the set of possible answers for a CAPTCHA is limited and can
be easily determined.

## Gray Box testing and example

Audit the application source code in order to reveal:

  - used CAPTCHA implementation and version - there are many known
    vulnerabilities in widely used CAPTCHA implementations, see
    <http://osvdb.org/search?request=captcha>
  - if the application sends encrypted or hashed value from the client
    (which is a very bad security practice) verify if used encryption or
    hash algorithm is sufficiently strong

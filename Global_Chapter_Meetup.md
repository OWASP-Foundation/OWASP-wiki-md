# OWASP Global Chapter Meetings

In addition to local chapter meetings organized by leaders in
communities all over the world, OWASP Global Chapter meetings are an
opportunity for community members that don't have access to a local
chapter to get engaged and participate in OWASP discussions. This is a
new initiative, and volunteers to help with the organizational,
technical, and social challenges are invited to participate\!

## Meeting Format

Ideally Global Chapter meetings should follow a rough format:

### 1\. Host Chapter Introduction

The host chapter should introduce themselves, announce the chapter, and
announce which chapters are participating.

### 2\. Participating Chapter Introductions

Individual chapters should have the opportunity to introduce themselves,
and the number of people in attendance.

### 3\. OWASP Monthly Updates

A guest speaker (such as a chapter or project lead, board member, OWASP
staff member) should work through a set of chapter items collected in
advance of the meeting to update the community on the last months
events, announcements, and any interesting things that have happened.
Upcoming chapter meetings should most definitely be referenced (either
as a count, or listing chapters that have meetings before the next
global chapter meeting.

### 4\. Speaker Presentation

The chapter host should introduce the speaker, and then hand off the
session to the speaker, with the chapter and online hosts working to
ensure that questions from remote participants are raised (and repeated
for the audience).

### 5\. Moderated Round Table Discussion

After the speaker presentation, the chapter and online host should
facilitate a moderated discussion about a range of topics (initially
related to the speakers topics, but also a related list of round table
items proposed prior to, or during the meeting.

### 6\. Closing Remarks

The chapter host should close the meeting with an announcement of the
date, time, and location of the next meeting, including the speaker
details.

## Speaker Rules

Speakers must comply with the standard [OWASP Speaker
Agreement](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Speaker_Agreement). Slides
and media will be shared to the online community by the online
organizer, and as a result must be shared a week in advance to allow for
proper testing.

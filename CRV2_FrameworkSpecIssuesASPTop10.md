# Using OWASP TOP 10 as your guideline

The OWASP TOP 10
(https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-Top_10)is a detailed
list of the highest security risks web application faces. It help us
identify the most critical security threats facing organizations.
Performing a Code review efficiently requires using a model or framework
that help us identify these issues quickly. Consequently, OWASP TOP 10
is one of these guides that provides us with the necessary information
to implement proper Code Review.

## Applying OWASP TOP 10 to ASP.NET code review

The following table contains OWASP TOP 10 - 2013 guideline and how you
can apply this during your code review

| OWASP TOP 10 risk                                   | Description      | What to look for in the code                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| style="width: 200px;"                               | **A1 Injection** |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **A2 Broken Authentication and Session Management** |                  | Application functions related to authentication and session management are often not implemented correctly, allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens, or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users’ identities.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **A3 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**                   |                  | XSS flaws occur whenever an application takes untrusted data and sends it to a web browser without proper validation or escaping. XSS allows attackers to execute scripts in the victim’s browser which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites, or redirect the user to malicious sites                                                                                                                                                |
| **A4 Insecure Direct Object References**            |                  | A direct object reference occurs when a developer exposes a reference to an internal implementation object, such as a file, directory, or database key. Without an access control check or other protection, attackers can manipulate these references to access unauthorized data.                                                                                                                                                        |
| **A5-Security Misconfiguration**                    |                  | Security misconfiguration can happen at any level of an application stack, including the platform, web server, application server, database, framework, and custom code. Developers and system administrators need to work together to ensure that the entire stack is configured properly. Automated scanners are useful for detecting missing patches, misconfigurations, use of default accounts, unnecessary services, etc.            |
| **A6-Sensitive Data Exposure**                      |                  | The most common flaw is simply not encrypting sensitive data. When crypto is employed, weak key generation and management, and weak algorithm usage is common, particularly weak password hashing techniques. Browser weaknesses are very common and easy to detect, but hard to exploit on a large scale. External attackers have difficulty detecting server side flaws due to limited access and they are also usually hard to exploit. |
| **A7-Missing Function Level Access Control**        |                  | Applications do not always protect application functions properly. Sometimes, function level protection is managed via configuration, and the system is misconfigured. Sometimes, developers must include the proper code checks, and they forget. Detecting such flaws is easy. The hardest part is identifying which pages (URLs) or functions exist to attack.                                                                          |
| **A8-Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**            |                  | A CSRF attack forces a logged-on victim’s browser to send a forged HTTP request, including the victim’s session cookie and any other automatically included authentication information, to a vulnerable web application. This allows the attacker to force the victim’s browser to generate requests the vulnerable application thinks are legitimate requests from the victim.                                                            |
| **A9-Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities**  |                  | Components, such as libraries, frameworks, and other software modules, almost always run with full privileges. If a vulnerable component is exploited, such an attack can facilitate serious data loss or server takeover. Applications using components with known vulnerabilities may undermine application defenses and enable a range of possible attacks and impacts.                                                                 |
| **A10-Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards**          |                  | Web applications frequently redirect and forward users to other pages and websites, and use untrusted data to determine the destination pages. Without proper validation, attackers can redirect victims to phishing or malware sites, or use forwards to access unauthorized pages.                                                                                                                                                       |

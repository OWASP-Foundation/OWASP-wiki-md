\===Minutes=== There was the question of setting op a chapter contact
list? I.e. possibly including more than e-mails.

Harald had the question on what to start the chapter with: Norway or
Oslo. There are not really guidelines for this: it depends on the local
(geographical) situation and chapter radius ambitions.

Then there was the topic: "Can we collect all our successful experiences
with local organization such as ISACA, ISSA, etc, and try to duplicate
these experiences on other Chapters?"
Local contacts with ISSA/ISACA or regional security organisations are of
course encouraged to have a broader communication reach.

It is important to repeat the official policy on OWASP brand protection
and to guard the OWASP 'open' community preventing commercial
take-overs. It is e.g. important to prevent and/or expose local abuse of
OWASP domain name hijacking and to protect the OWASP trademark.

Likewise we should continously generate interest, present OWASP success
case studies (like: not directly paid: but being recognized as local
authority on the subject, etc...)and repeat message to increase local
involvement / blogs entries ...

To support chapters the following stuff is needed:

  - Have marketing material: e.g. high-res logo, stuff (posters /
    flyers) to put on conference boots. Top10 Book.
  - Content: Have financial support for 'flying OWASP presenters' to do
    OWASP related topics at other chapters / mini-conferences
  - A mentoring program by experienced chaper leaders for new chapters
    to aid in the first phases of starting it up and growing the
    chapter.

There is the idea to test out to organize regular miniconferences at the
European level to support local chapers. It is agreed to try this out in
September with pure OWASP topics (possibly 2 tracks: Newbies and
technical/experience sharing). This could be done at a university with
some local sponsorship.

It is a good idea to have a local debriefing of the EU conference: a
slide-deck compilation can be created and it would be nice to support
this with maybe one speaker (with support of the 'flying OWASP
presenters' idea: we need a better name for this).

It would be nice to have chapter leader doing a debriefing (summary:
what went well, what needs improvement) on chapter meetings through a
dedicated chapter leader mailing list, besides the online meeting
minutes. Preferably this is separated from the project leaders mailing
list?

A list of inactive chapters (i.e. no sign of activity during 6 months)
should be made available so that interested people can jump in and kick
some life into it.

How do we finances local chapters? A list should be compiled of what
OWASP could pay for centrally if the need occurs:

  - Catering
  - Liability insurance - normally to be covered by the premise host
    sponsor\!
  - PR
  - Marketing material

Policy and procedures to be set up for this.

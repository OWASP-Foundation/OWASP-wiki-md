**Items up for Board Vote**

Both kits include the following:

$5.10 for T-shirt

$0.50 for Sticker

$1.79 for Badge Holder (or similiar item)

$0.05 for Certificate

$2.00 for Membership Card

$4.25 for Kateâ€™s time (10 minutes each)

$6.00 avg. shipping for US kit

$12.78 shipping for non-US


Please note that Kate has found new laminated cards that will decrease
the cost of the membership card by about half, and will also save her
quite a bit of time.

**Service Provider Registry**

A list of commercial organisations that provide services in relation to
OWASP project deliverables;
E.g. ESAPI, SAMM, ASVS, Training (Dev, Code review, Testing) etc.
Question: Do we want one?
Question: Governance, should there be any code of conduct, restrictions,
quality control on registery or should OWASP simply provide the forum
and not police?

**OWASP Free Training**

Getting commonplace. Providing training on OWASP Materials.
Should OWASP Training require a fee for non members?
Should the fee for non members be in effect the annual membership fee?
Can this model be discussed?

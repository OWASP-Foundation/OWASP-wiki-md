### Original description

The aim of the hackathon is to understand and gather experiences from
bringing sec into devops practices. This means, that we bundle some
security tools to the CI pipeline. There is already a list of tools that
can be used, but each hackathon track team selects the tools that best
fit to their purposes.

There are three tracks in the hackathon:

1.  Application security testing
2.  Platform security hardening and testing
3.  Vulnerability management

Our hackathon goal is to make sec aware pipeline for OWASP Juice Shop
web application.
(https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Juice_Shop_Project).

The initial setup of the hackathon is a Jenkins server image having a
pipeline for building the juice shop. Participants will be provided with
instructions to install the Jenkins server and initial baseline, and
more detailed instructions.

Prerequisites:

  - Bring your laptop with docker installed
  - Briefly look at the tools that can be utilized in your track

The hackathon starts at 12:00 (Noon) and lasts till 23:00. Pizza, snacks
and beverages are served to the participants after 17:00 and the
hackathon lasts till midnight. You are free to leave earlier, but we
hope that every attendee can stay as long as possible.

After the hackathon we publish the results and achievements to OWASP
Wiki page.

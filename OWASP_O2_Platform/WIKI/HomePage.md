O2 is a collection of Open Source modules that help Web Application
Security Professionals maximize their efforts and quickly obtain high
visibility into an application's security profile. The objective is to
'Automate Application Security Knowledge and Workflows'.

### History

Originally O2 (OunceOpen) originated from OunceLabs Advanced Research
Team (ART) work, and aims to push to the limit the power of multiple
Static Analysis engines.

These tools have been developed by Security Professionals FOR security
professionals, and are designed to automate the security consultant's
brain.

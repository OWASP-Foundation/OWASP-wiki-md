<p>OWASP Store Sheep is a work in progress application do demonstrate security concepts relating to Windows Store Apps.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Store Sheep is a training app for Developers wishing to learn to securely code a Windows Store ('Metro Style') App, and Testers wanting to learn to test one. It contains a number of security vulnerabilities with explanations and fixes for them.</p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>Store Sheep (in line with the 'Goat' theme of Web Goat, Rails Goat etc - I thought it was about time we had a Sheep instead) is a training application for developers and testers. It takes the form of a pretend Windows Store App called 'A friend for Ewe' which is a dating agency for owners of pet Sheep.</p>
<p>The purpose of Store Sheep is for developers and testers alike to learn where these apps resemble and differ from traditional Win32 and Web applications and how to build them to resist attack. A side benefit from this project will be for the community to learn more about how the certification process for a big app store works and the kind of problems it does (and doesn't) find. I would imagine this would be relevant not only to Microsoft's Store but to Apple and Google's as well.</p>
<p>Broadly the idea at this stage is to get a basic app and some documentation up and running quite quickly and then to refine it as time goes on.</p>
<h2 id="licensing">Licensing</h2>
<p>OWASP Store Sheep is free to use. It is licensed under the GNU GPL v3 license, so you can copy, distribute and transmit the work, and you can adapt it, and use it commercially, but all provided that you attribute the work and if you alter, transform, or build upon this work, you may distribute the resulting work only under the same or similar license to this one.</p></td>

# Road Map and Getting Involved

As of June 2014, the priorities are:

The application in its finished form will have three versions.

1.  This 'original version' contains a number of critical
    vulnerabilities, some of which will cause it to fail WACK (Windows
    Application Certification Kit). As such, if submitted to the Windows
    Store it would be rejected by Microsoft. The associated
    documentation explains how to correct these problems and move it to
    B)
2.  This application passes WACK and may pass Microsoft's checks,
    however it still contains a number of vulnerabilities such as
    authorisation flaws, Web Service problems etc. which would cause it
    to be a danger to its users' data if put live. The associated
    documentation explains how to find and fix these problems.
3.  This 'fixed' version of the application represents a safe (if not
    tremendously useful\!) app which could pass through a Web
    Application 'penetration' test without any significant findings.

Involvement in the development and promotion of Store Sheep is actively
encouraged\! You do not have to be a security expert in order to
contribute. Some of the ways you can help:

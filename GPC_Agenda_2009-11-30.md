# Agenda

## Current Meeting

  - Reviewers Drive,
      - [Brad's
        Post](http://globalprojectscommittee.wordpress.com/2009/11/27/new-drive-for-project-reviewers/),
      - Next phase?
          - Maybe the next phases of this process could consist in
            pushing it forward by using [**this
            page**](OWASP_Project_Reviewers_Database "wikilink") to
            describe the review job role and, thereafter, by doing a
            call for reviewers through our leaders' mailing list.

-----

  - The [**OWASP Top Ten
    Project**](:Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project "wikilink") is almost
    ready to be reviewed against the assessment criteria 2.0 and so we
    will need either a Board or a GPC member to act as Second Reviewer.
    Do we have any volunteers?

-----

  - Eduardo Neves from the Brazilian Chapter asks if his company can be
    considered [**SAAM
    Project**](:Category:Software_Assurance_Maturity_Model "wikilink")'s
    sponsor if he allocates two of his company employees to translate it
    Portuguese. He also more broadly asks how does a sponsorship work.

## From Previous Meeting/Follow up

  - Spreading [OWASP Project Details
    Tab](:Template:OWASP_Project_Identification_Tab "wikilink") through

      - Revised\&improved wiki code to link projects and releases - Has
        this task been finished? Are there any available
        instructions/documentation?

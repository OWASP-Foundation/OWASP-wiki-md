## OWASP Site Generator

### Executive Summary

OWASP Site Generator is a great tool, but it could be even better and
more widespread. Thereâ€™s a lot room for improvements to both its
functionality and user experience. The way I see it, main user needs to
be addressed and specific development objectives for the next release of
OWASP Site Generator would be the following.

### User Needs

  - Create multiple types of sites easily
  - Track and analyze requests easily
  - Change the look and feel of the resulting sites easily
  - Create sites for multiple web backend technologies easily
  - Learn how to use OWASP Site Generator easily

### Development Objectives

  - Create a vulnerability library that can be used for web services,
    HTML forms, AJAX, etc. instead of having to craft the same attack
    for each
  - Add support for logging of all received requests, as well as
    querying resulting log files
  - "Templatize" the code generation process, so it can support skinning
    of the resulting sites
  - "Templatize" the code generation process, so it can support
    different backend web technologies
  - Fix all significant defects in the current release of OWASP Site
    Generator
  - Redesign the GUI to make it more efficient and user friendly
  - Create a smooth setup program which would install both client and
    server components as effortlessly as possible
  - Write documentation and articles about it
  - Make the development process open to the public and, hopefully,
    driven by its feedback from day one

## Automated Crawling & Security Analysis of Flash/Flex based Web Applications

The move to web 2.0 and RIA (Rich Internet Applications) has presented
new obstacles for automated web application scanners and crawlers.
Specifically, the ability to automatically crawl Flash/Flex based
applications and to analyze AMF traffic (proprietary Adobe binary
message format) for security vulnerabilities. This presentation will
discuss the following subjects -

1.  Introduction to Flash/Flex applications
2.  High level description of the AMF protocol and its usage
3.  Automated Flash Testing Challenges (Crawling & Testing)
4.  Overview of security risks in Flash/Flex applications

Note: while this presentation is not product specific, it comes to show
the current problems of automated security solutions, and will show the
implementation that was done in IBM/Watchfire AppScan as a possible
solution. We do not plan to pitch the product explicitly.

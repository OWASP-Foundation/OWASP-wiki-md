# Agenda

## From Previous Meeting/Follow up

  - Modification of Assessment Criteria v2 (ACv2) - selecting optional
    items
      - Review of email templates to reflect any changes from above.
  - Freezing ACv2 requirements for a set period of time (e.x. 2 years)
      - Determine process to make minor modifications during the
        'feature freeze' - perhaps Board approval of changes

-----

  - ["OWASP Mini-Summit 2009"](:Summit_2009 "wikilink")/[:OWASP AppSec
    DC 2009](:OWASP_AppSec_DC_2009 "wikilink"):
      - GPC needs to prepare its workshop.

-----

  - Spreading [OWASP Project Details
    Tab](:Template:OWASP_Project_Identification_Tab "wikilink") through
    ALL OWASP Projects.
      - ALL the projects with defined leadership already HAVE the GPC
        Project Details Tab - Check out ["OWASP Projects
        Dashboard"](OWASP_Project_Details_Table "wikilink"),
          - Methodology to fill in the referred tab?
          - Methodology to link the tab to each project?
      - Does it make sense keeping in our new template the field
        ***Project Health*** while the criteria for its assessment
        haven't been built still? Couldn't we "hide" it until it is
        ready for public display?

-----

  - New Assessment Criteria
      - Jason/Pravir â€“ case studies & documentation the assessment
        criteria

-----

  - Honorary memberships to be given to "active" OWASP participants
    (chapter leader, project participants, etc.). Chapter and projects
    committees to submit proposal for persons to be given membership.
      - Clarify rules
      - Clarify methodology:
          - Shall we use the ["OWASP Projects
            Dashboard"](OWASP_Project_Details_Table "wikilink") after
            adding a new field to manage "project leaders"?
          - Shall we replicate the ["OWASP Projects
            Dashboard"](OWASP_Project_Details_Table "wikilink") using a
            Google Spreadsheet?

-----

  - Projects committee should determine which projects/project leaders
    are supported financially. Travel, evangelism, publication,
    training, etc.....
      - Matt Tesauro's draft to deal with this kind of issues.

-----

  - Committee members' evaluation process.
      - "GPC - Send 'Individual Committee Member' [online
        form](https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=ckdDbXE0bkxPM3dkbDZvSmFNWVBGcnc6MA)".

<p>The OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) Project provides a basis for testing web application technical security controls and also provides developers with a list of requirements for secure development.</p>
<p>The primary aim of the <strong>OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) Project</strong> is to normalize the range in the coverage and level of rigor available in the market when it comes to performing Web application security verification using a commercially-workable open standard. The standard provides a basis for testing application technical security controls, as well as any technical security controls in the environment, that are relied on to protect against vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL injection. This standard can be used to establish a level of confidence in the security of Web applications. The requirements were developed with the following objectives in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use as a metric</strong> - Provide application developers and application owners with a yardstick with which to assess the degree of trust that can be placed in their Web applications,</li>
<li><strong>Use as guidance</strong> - Provide guidance to security control developers as to what to build into security controls in order to satisfy application security requirements, and</li>
<li><strong>Use during procurement</strong> - Provide a basis for specifying application security verification requirements in contracts.</li>

# Glossary

![Image:Asvs-letters.jpg](Asvs-letters.jpg
"Image:Asvs-letters.jpg")**ASVS Terminology**

  - **Access Control** – A means of restricting access to files,
    referenced functions, URLs, and data based on the identity of users
    and/or groups to which they belong.
  - **Application Component** – An individual or group of source files,
    libraries, and/or executables, as defined by the verifier for a
    particular application.
  - **Application Security** – Application-level security focuses on the
    analysis of components that comprise the application layer of the
    Open Systems Interconnection Reference Model (OSI Model), rather
    than focusing on for example the underlying operating system or
    connected networks.
  - **Application Security Verification** – The technical assessment of
    an application against the OWASP ASVS.
  - **Application Security Verification Report** – A report that
    documents the overall results and supporting analysis produced by
    the verifier for a particular application.
  - **Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)** – An OWASP
    standard that defines four levels of application security
    verification for applications.
  - **Authentication** – The verification of the claimed identity of an
    application user.
  - **Automated Verification** – The use of automated tools (either
    dynamic analysis tools, static analysis tools, or both) that use
    vulnerability signatures to find problems.
  - **Back Doors** – A type of malicious code that allows unauthorized
    access to an application.
  - **Blacklist** – A list of data or operations that are not permitted,
    for example a list of characters that are not allowed as input.

    the basis for the verification of the design and implementation of
    security controls in IT products.
  - **Communication Security** – The protection of application data when
    it is transmitted between application components, between clients
    and servers, and between external systems and the application.
  - **Design Verification** – The technical assessment of the security

  - **Internal Verification** – The technical assessment of specific
    aspects of the security architecture of an application as defined in
    the OWASP ASVS.
  - **Cryptographic module** – Hardware, software, and/or firmware that
    implements cryptographic algorithms and/or generates cryptographic
    keys.
  - **Denial of Service (DOS) Attacks** – The flooding of an application
    with more requests than it can handle.
  - **Dynamic Verification** – The use of automated tools that use
    vulnerability signatures to find problems during the execution of an
    application.
  - **Easter Eggs** – A type of malicious code that does not run until a
    specific user input event occurs.
  - **External Systems** – A server-side application or service that is
    not part of the application.
  - **FIPS 140-2** – A standard that can be used as the basis for the
    verification of the design and implementation of cryptographic
    modules
  - **Input Validation** – The canonicalization and validation of
    untrusted user input.
  - **Malicious Code** – Code introduced into an application during its
    development unbeknownst to the application owner which circumvents
    the application’s intended security policy. Not the same as malware
    such as a virus or worm\!
  - **Malware** – Executable code that is introduced into an application
    during runtime without the knowledge of the application user or
    administrator.
  - **Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)** – The Open Web
    Application Security Project (OWASP) is a worldwide free and open
    community focused on improving the security of application software.
    Our mission is to make application security "visible," so that
    people and organizations can make informed decisions about
    application security risks. See: <http://www.owasp.org/>
  - **Output Validation** – The canonicalization and validation of
    application output to Web browsers and to external systems.
  - **OWASP Enterprise Security API (ESAPI)** – A free and open
    collection of all the security methods that developers need to build
    secure Web applications. See: <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/ESAPI>
  - **OWASP Risk Rating Methodology** – A risk rating methodology that
    has been customized for application security. See:
    <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/How_to_value_the_real_risk>
  - **OWASP Testing Guide** – A document designed to help organizations
    understand what comprises a testing program, and to help them
    identify the steps needed to build and operate that testing program.
    See: <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Testing_Project>
  - **OWASP Top Ten** – A document that represents a broad consensus
    about what the most critical Web application security flaws are.
    See: <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top10>
  - **Positive** – See whitelist.
  - **Salami Attack** – A type of malicious code that is used to
    redirect small amounts of money without detection in financial
    transactions.
  - **Security Architecture** – An abstraction of an application’s
    design that identifies and describes where and how security controls
    are used, and also identifies and describes the location and
    sensitivity of both user and application data.
  - **Security Control** – A function or component that performs a
    security check (e.g. an access control check) or when called results
    in a security effect (e.g. generating an audit record).
  - **Security Configuration** – The runtime configuration of an
    application that affects how security controls are used.
  - **Static Verification** – The use of automated tools that use
    vulnerability signatures to find problems in application source
    code.
  - **Target of Verification (TOV)** – If you are performing an
    application security verification according to the OWASP ASVS
    requirements, the verification will be of a particular application.
    This application is called the "Target of Verification" or simply
    the TOV.
  - **Threat Modeling** - A technique consisting of developing
    increasingly refined security architectures to identify threat
    agents, security zones, security controls, and important technical
    and business assets.
  - **Time Bomb** – A type of malicious code that does not run until a
    preconfigured time or date elapses.
  - **Verifier** - The person or team that is reviewing an application
    against the OWASP ASVS requirements.
  - **Whitelist** – A list of permitted data or operations, for example
    a list of characters that are allowed to perform input validation.

OWASP ASVS in mind, and NOT making any claims of meeting any given level
in the standard. Please let us know how your organization is using OWASP
ASVS. Include your name, organization's name, and brief description of
how you use the standard. The project lead can be reached
[here](mailto:sahba@securitycompass.com).

# Precedents-Interpretations

**PI-0001: Are there levels between the levels?**

  - Issue: Are there levels between the levels for the cases where "The
    specification for an application may require OWASP ASVS Level N, but
    it could also include other additional detailed requirements such as
    from a higher ASVS level"?
  - Resolution: No. Use of alternate level definitions or notations such
    as "ASVS Level 1B+" is discouraged.
  - References: ASVS section "Application Security Verification Levels"

**PI-0002: Is use of a master key simply another level of indirection?**

  - Issue: If a master key is stored as plaintext, isn't using a master
    key simply another level of indirection?
  - Resolution: No. There is a strong rationale for having a "master
    key" stored in a secure location that is used to encrypt all other
    secrets. In many applications, there are lots of secrets stored in
    many different locations. This greatly increases the likelihood that
    one of them will be compromised. Having a single master key makes
    managing the protection considerably simpler and is not simply a
    level of indirection.
  - References: ASVS verification requirement V2.14

**PI-0003: What is a "TOV" or "Target of Verification"?**

  - Issue: New terminology
  - Resolution: If you are performing an application security
    verification according to ASVS, the verification will be of a
    particular application. This application is called the "Target of
    Verification" or simply the TOV. The TOV should be identified in
    verification documentation as follows:
      - TOV Identification – <name and version of the application> or
        <Application name>, <application version>, dynamic testing was
        performed in a staging environment, not the production
        environment
      - TOV Developer –
        <insert name of the developer or verification customer>

you can help with translations, please download the latest draft here:

<https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS>

If there are any incomprehensible English idiom or phrases in there,
please don't hesitate to ask for clarification, because if it's hard to
translate, it's almost certainly wrong in English as well. We recommend
logging translation issues in GitHub, too, so please make yourself
known.

Translations are coordinated through OWASP's Crowd In account, so you
don't have to do the entire thing yourself.

<https://crowdin.com/project/owasp-asvs/>

You don't HAVE to use Crowd In, but it would be nice to indicate to
other native speakers of your language that you are willing to work
together. This is a 70 page document, and in all honesty, will take a
dedicated person a week or more to translate, so please please please
work together rather than apart. You have full access to the original
document and the original images, so you have everything I have.

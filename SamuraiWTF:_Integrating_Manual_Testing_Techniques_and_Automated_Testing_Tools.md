**Course Abstract:** One of the best skills a penetration tester can
learn is not how to use a lot of penetration testing tools such as those
on the SamuraiWTF DVD, but rather how to successfully integrate their
manual testing techniques with all of those penetration testing tools.
This one-day course focuses on this skill through two instructor-lead
penetration tests followed by a capture-the-flag like student challenge.
This course also introduces you to several of SamuraiWTF's testing tools
such as Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP), w3af, and the latest Firefox extensions
for penetration testing. This course is designed for persons new to
penetration testing and for those persons with basic to intermediate
experience with web application penetration testing. Please come
prepared with VMware player, workstation, or fusion pre-installed.

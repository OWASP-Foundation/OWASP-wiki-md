"Owasp_logo_normal.jpg")Cloud computing is a cost effective and
efficient way for enterprises to automate their processes. However
organizations need to be aware of the pitfalls of the many cloud
solutions out there - one of the main being security. Most cloud
applications were built for ease of use and without security necessarily
in mind. Companies need to be asking their solution providers about the
security measures used in developing the application and get an
independent verification to make sure there are no gaping holes. With
over 75% of attacks occurring through the Web, any attack through these
applications can lead to leakage of confidential information and
embarrassment. In this session, we'll give attendees tips and tricks to
prepare them for the potential of "stormy weather."

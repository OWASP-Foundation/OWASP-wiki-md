`ADJOURNMENT`

## Old Business

## New Business

  - To vote on the events strategy as discussed during the June Board
    meeting <http://sl.owasp.org/globalappsecstrategy>
  - To hear the foundations feedback on a global (AppSec) event in Tel
    Aviv and **vote** on hosting an event there in 2019.
      - I could urge the board to listen back to the recordings on what
        has been communicated to the community.
      - The recodring can be found here:
        <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yXPSr8XcFnO63vXSTOCRTb16tn5YTFww/view>
  - Vote of the compliance committee charter.
  - Coursera
      - UC Davis would like to use OWASP ideas and content to create
        coursware on Coursera consisting of:
          - Unchanged OWASP reference materials (we would link these
            directly from OWASP site so they are always current).
          - Video lectures based on OWASP materials and instructor
            experience.
          - Quizzes and small practice exercises based on the OWASP
            materials.
          - Exercises with OWASP tools such as JuiceShop (we would not
            modify the tools, but will create prompts, context, and peer
            grading rubrics).
          - This course would be marketed to Coursera's audience of 30M+
            learners globally.
          - Video, quiz, and exercise content may be derivative work
            from the OWASP source content.
          - Videos can be accessed without login or any other
            authentication requirement from UC Davis, Coursera, and
            OWASP.
          - Access to the videos within context of the course requires
            learners to set up a Coursera login.
          - Assignments and exercises will be behind the paywall for the
            courses. Scholarships are available and widely used for the
            courses.
  - Amend bylaws in relation to board meeting attendance

## Discussion

1.  **The structure of the board:**
    1.  Do we need more diverse views on the board? e.g. adding 1 or 2
        indpependent board memebers who have difference experiences in
        charities/foundations (i.e. specialise in finance/HR/Governance
        etc..).
    2.  The concern is we have a rotating list of board memebers who
        specialise in AppSec, but not necessarily the skills needed to
        set the strategy for a foundation. For most foundations (can
        companies their boards are people form diverse backgrounds for
        that very reason.
2.  **Adding Resilence in the managment of the foundation:**
    1.  An ED for OWASP must be a full time epmployee. If the
        chairperson would like to step in the role of (interim) ED they
        can do so, but only if they take a full time position within
        OWASP (which also means resigning from their current full
        eomployment roles).
    2.  Should we have a clause that says at any time we need a named
        iterim ED incase anything goes wrong.
    3.  Establish a process for the interm period (either we find a new
        ED, or tranistion the interm ED into the permanent role.
3.  **Setting Scheduled Cycles for the foundation strategy:**
    1.  We need a process to develop, review, and adjust the strategic
        direction for the foundation on a regularl basis, that is also
        in-sync with the BoD elections.
    2.  We still (as of end of June) do not have a strategy for the
        foundation agreed for the foundation to execute, granted we have
        a few initiatives we need to address in peice meal but we have
        not set the over all picture.
    3.  I have seen a proposal from Karen but this needs to be reviewed
        and agreed with the BoD ammendments. As a board we have yet to
        set one, and I would like us to go over this during the
        meetings.
    4.  **Addressing the effectiveness of OWASP Board meetings**
    5.  How do we bring more votable items and valuable strategic
        discussions to our meetings.

## Description

It makes/fills email extractors/spammers' programs with thousands of
fake email addresses endlessly dynamically generated by
phpMySpamFighter. So even if your site visitors post their email
addresses in plain format, spammers will give up searching for correct
ones. It may cause Denial-Of-Service attack back to their programs.In
fact, it fights not only spammers but also your attackers who use the
similar tools to probe your web sites.

## Requirements

PHP 4/5

## Demonstration

## Installation

Pretty Easy\! Just insert the following html code in your web pages:

`  `<a style="display:none" href="phpMySpamFighter.php"></a>

Making display:none makes Search Engines ignore the link. Only
spammers's softwares follow this link and will get sucked. If you're
good at PHP, tweak the code to maximum security\!

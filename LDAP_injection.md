## Description

LDAP Injection is an attack used to exploit web based applications that
construct LDAP statements based on user input. When an application fails
to properly sanitize user input, itâ€™s possible to modify LDAP statements
using a local proxy. This could result in the execution of arbitrary
commands such as granting permissions to unauthorized queries, and
content modification inside the LDAP tree. The same advanced
exploitation techniques available in [SQL
Injection](SQL_Injection "wikilink") can be similarly applied in LDAP
Injection.

Once again this year the Portland OWASP chapter is hosting an
information security training day\! This will be an excellent
opportunity for those interested to receive quality information security
and application security training for next to nothing. It's also a great
chance to network with the local infosec community and meet those who
share your interests.

# Courses

Courses are held in two tracks: three in the morning session, and three
in the afternoon session. Each participant can register for one morning
course, or one afternoon course, or one of each. **The cost per course
is $25.** The six courses offered are as follows:

## Morning Session 8:30 AM - Noon

### Client-side Security for Modern Web Applications (SOP, XSS, CSRF, CSP, etc)

#### Sponsored by New Relic

*Instructor: Timothy Morgan*

Abstract: This course introduces the student to key concepts of browser
security, such as the same-origin policy, and continues with a series of
web-specific vulnerability classes, including: cross-site scripting,
cross-site request forgery, clickjacking, and JSON hijacking. The course
finishes up by covering new security mechanisms and standards, including
cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) and content security policy (CSP).

### Cyber Security Framework

#### Sponsored by Online Business Systems

*Instructor: James Trumper*

Abstract: Are you looking for a place to start addressing your
information security posture, how to understand current maturity and
plan future enhancements and budget? Have you been tasked with complying
or using an information security framework? The CyberSecurity Framework
(CSF) is a comprehensive information security framework developed by
NIST (the National Institute of Standards and Technology). Although the
framework is required for many federal agencies and used by State and
local agencies, it is also recommended for use by non-governmental
organizations including small to medium businesses. In this course, we
will review the framework's structure and components, going into details
around specific requirements as well as references to NIST 800-53. Once
we have a good foundation around the CSF categories and sub-categories,
we will transition into how we can manage our efforts to this framework.
The course provides a creative-commons management tool to track current
controls, maturity, existing budget, plan for future control enhancement
projects, and future budget requests. The tool is both an internal
tracking tool as well as a presentation layer to various teams and
management based on their need-to-know.

### Securing Your AWS Environment

*Instructor: Derek Hill*

Abstract: Are you looking to move your infrastructure into the cloud,
but are worried about how to secure it? Are you ready to let go of all
of your physical infrastructure? You are not alone in this journey. The
cloud does not have to be this scary unknown black hole. Sure, things
are certainly different and not everything that you used to do in your
own infrastructure is easily repeatable in the cloud; however, there are
many benefits. Thing are different, but many things are the same. We
will discuss how to secure your cloud environment using both AWS tools
and third party tools, including some custom applications that allow you
to see what you have and how you need to secure it. We are successfully
managing over 120 AWS accounts with approximately 3000 instances and
many other AWS services. This class does not have any labs (due to the
short duration). We will have some demos on how we accomplish certain
tasks. We hope that you can take away some ideas on how to solve some of
your current security problems and gain the confidence that security in
the cloud can be achieved.

## Afternoon Session: 1:30 PM - 5:00 PM

### Burp and ZAP: Introduction into web intercept/scanning tools

*Instructor: Alexei Kojenov*

Abstract: The participants will learn how browsers communicate with web
application back ends and how special tools such as Burp Suite and OWASP
ZAP can be used to intercept, analyze and modify these communications to
assess the application's security posture and, ultimately, to find and
exploit vulnerabilities. We will discuss and try both passive and active
attacks while diving deeper into each tool's functionality. We will talk
about how to efficiently use the available features, as well as the ways
to automate manual tasks. The participants will be able to immediately
practice the learned skills during the class, and then apply them in
their work environments. Prerequisites: A laptop (any OS) with Firefox
or Chrome and Oracle VirtualBox (participants will be given a virtual
machine with intentionally vulnerable web application for practice).

### Applied Physical Attacks on Embedded Systems, Introductory Version

*Instructor: Joe Fitzpatrick*

Abstract: This workshop introduces several different relatively
accessible interfaces on embedded systems. Attendees will get hands-on
experience with UART, SPI, and JTAG interfaces on a MIPS-based wifi
router. After a brief architectural overview of each interface, hands-on
labs will guide through the process understanding, observing,
interacting with, and exploiting the interface to potentially access a
root shell on the target.

### Cyber First-Aid: Introduction to Incident Response

*Instructor: Kris Rosenberg*

Abstract: In today’s world It is not a question of “if” you will get
hacked, but “when”. More importantly. what are you going to do about it?
When an incident occurs you need to be prepared to respond quickly to
minimize losses and collect any potential evidence that could be used
for a more detailed analysis of the incident. Much like a typical first
aid course that prepares first responders to give immediate care needed
to sustain life, this session is designed to give those who are
typically the first on-scene to a cybersecurity event the skills they
need to effectively identify and contain the incident, and preserve
potentially valuable evidence for further forensic analysis.

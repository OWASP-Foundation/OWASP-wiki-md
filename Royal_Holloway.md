  - ''Implementing cryptography: good theory vs. bad practice - Viet

    Abstract: Cryptography is being widely implemented in software to
    provide security features. The main reason is that, many
    cryptographic mechanisms are mathematically proven secure, or
    trusted secure given some mathematical reasoning. However, to take
    full advantages of these mechanisms, they must be implemented
    strictly according to the theoretical models, e.g., several
    cryptographic mechanisms must be used together, in a specific manner
    to provide a desired security goal. However, without strong
    cryptographic background, many software developers tend to deviate
    from these models, thus making their own security software a gold
    mine for attackers. This talk gives examples to show why such
    situations exist, where do they spread, and how bad they may turn
    into.

  - ''Securing the SSL channel against man-in-the-middle attacks: Future
    technologies - HTTP Strict Transport Security and and Pinning of
    Certs - ([Tobias
    Gondrom](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/User:Tgondrom))
    ([PDF](http://www.gondrom.org/owasp/presentations/OWASP_defending-MITMA_RHUL.pdf))

    "In the recent months major trusted CAs providing trusted
    certificates for SSL/TLS in browser scenarios were compromised (e.g.
    seen in the Diginotar breach) and based on the current trust models
    (trusting all registered CAs equally for all domains) exposed vital
    web applications to the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks. Several
    approaches are currently discussed to mitigate this risk. The most
    advanced and closest to final adoption being the technologies
    discussed by the browser vendors at the recent IETF meeting in
    November in Taipei: HSTS and pinning of certificates. To better
    protect content providers against the distribution of bogus
    certificates, an HTTP header extension containing a fingerprint of
    their certificates linked to a domain address has been defined. This
    approach, which has been partly tested in Chrome, and already helped
    identify and protect to some extend Google's web application in the
    recent Diginotar compromise. Chrome users were able to detect the
    bogus DigiNotar certificates because Chrome had embedded the hashes
    of valid Google certificates. Back in July, the hacked DigiNotar
    certificate authority (CA), which has since gone out of business,
    was used to issue more than five hundred bogus certificates for
    companies including Google and various intelligence services."

    Wordpress is one if the most popular blogging systems in the world
    but is routinely used to shoehorn complex sites into a blog shaped
    box, often because of it's flexibility and ease of use. In this
    talk, Mandalorian's Steve Lord discusses common Wordpress security
    snafus and how to avoid them.

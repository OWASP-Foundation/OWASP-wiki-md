The OWASP Software Security Assurance Process (OSSAP) main intent is to
embed security in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). OSSAP
reduces the possibility of requirement oversights, design flaws,
implementation bugs and deployment configuration mistakes during the
SDLC. This project outlines mandatory and recommended processes and
practices to manage risks associated with applications. What is exactly
Software Assurance? Software assurance is defined as the level of
confidence that software is free from vulnerabilities, either
intentionally designed into the software or accidentally inserted at any
time during its life cycle, and that the software functions in the
intended manner. Reference:

## Others

# Road Map and Getting Involved

As of XXX, the priorities are to generate, review and publish:

  - Software Security Integration in the SDLC Process
  - Security Requirements Identification Process
  - Design Security Review Process
  - Architecture Security Review Process
  - Security Code Review Process
  - Security Testing Process
  - Deployment Security Review Process

#### Main

Welcome to the OWASP Web2.0 Project page. In this part of OWASP, we are
going to talk about Web2.0 security and in general cutting-edge web
application hacking. Before going any further it is essential to
describe what Web2.0 is.

Web2.0, as some people say, is when the content is generated by the
user/group while the site revenue is consumed by the vendor. However,
Web2.0 is about integration. This subject largely involves all types of
technologies such as XML, XSLT, Feeds, JavaScript, Server side scripts,
RIA, etc.

The project is currently at alpha stage but it will expand soon. While
we are working on OWASP Web2.0 Project pages, check the following
articles for further reference.

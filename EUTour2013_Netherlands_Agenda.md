<td><p><strong>OWASP Europe TOUR,</strong> is an event across the European region that promotes awareness about application security, so that people and organizations can make informed decisions about true application security risks. Everyone is free to participate in OWASP and all of our materials are available under a free and open software license.</p>
<ul>
<li>Apart from OWASP's Top 10, most OWASP Projects are not widely used and understood. In most cases this is not due to lack of quality and usefulness of those Document &amp; Tool projects, but due to a lack of understanding of where they fit in an Enterprise's security ecosystem or in the Web Application Development Life-cycle.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This event aims to change that by providing a selection of mature and enterprise ready projects together with practical examples of how to use them.</li>

align="center" colspan="0" | The OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is an easy
to use integrated penetration testing tool for finding vulnerabilities
in web applications. It is designed to be used by people with a wide
range of security experience and as such is ideal for developers and
functional testers who are new to penetration testing as well as being a
useful addition to an experienced pen testers toolbox. It is also
community project, being maintained by a worldwide group of volunteers
and is completely free, open source and cross platform. Since its
release in 2010 ZAP has gone from strength to strength and is now a
flagship OWASP project. |- | style="width:10%" valign="middle"

We continue to rely on a “pentest” to secure our applications. Why do we
think it is acceptable to perform a time-limited test of an application
to help ensure security when a determined attacker may spend 10-100
times longer attempting to find a suitable vulnerability? Our testing
methodologies are non-consistent and rely on the individual and the
tools they use. Currently we treat vulnerabilities like XSS and SQLI as
different issues but the root causes it the same. – it’s all code
injection theory\!\! Why do we do this and make security bugs over
complex?
Why are we still happy with “Testing security out” rather than the more
superior “building security in”? |- | style="width:10%" valign="middle"

colspan="0" | Secure coding is often perceived as difficult and complex.
While it is true that 'good security' should be embedded into the
design, there are a couple of steps a developer can take which lead to a
more secure application. In this presentation we will go to the basics
of secure application development and demonstrate these principles which
help you build security into your application. |- | style="width:10%"

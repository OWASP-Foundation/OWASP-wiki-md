''' Bio '''

Samy Kamkar is best known for the Samy worm, the first XSS worm,
infecting over one million users on MySpace in less than 24 hours. A
co-founder of Fonality, Inc., an IP PBX company, Samy previously led the
development of top-level domain name server software and systems for
Global Domains International (.ws).

In the past 10 years, Samy has focused on evolutionary and genetic
algorithmic software development, Voice over IP software development,
automated security and vulnerability research in network security,
reverse engineering, and network gaming. When not strapped behind the
Matrix, Samy can be found stunt driving and getting involved in local
community service projects.
''' How Samy met your girlfriend '''

How I Met Your Girlfriend: The discovery and execution of entirely new
classes of Web attacks in order to meet your girlfriend.

This includes entertaining and newly discovered attacks including PHP
session prediction and random numbers (accurately guessing PHP session
cookies), browser protocol confusion (turning a browser into an SMTP
server), firewall and NAT penetration via Javascript (turning your
router against you), extracting extremely accurate geolocation
information from a Web browser (not using IP geolocation), and more.

''' Bios '''

Christian Heinrich is the Project Leader of the OWASP "Google Hacking"
Project i.e. "Download Indexed Cache" and has contributed to the
"Spiders/Robots/Crawlers" and "Search Engine Reconnaissance" sections of
the OWASP Testing Guide v3 and more recently to the development of the
OWASP Top Ten and Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)
OWASP Projects. He has presented at OWASP Conferences in USA, Australia
and Europe and OWASP Chapters in London, UK and Sydney and Melbourne,
Australia.
<u>Google Hacking:</u>

Google Hacks is a compilation of carefully crafted Google searches that
expose novel functionality from Google's search and map services. For
example, you can use it to view a timeline of your search results, view
a map, search for music, search for books, and perform many other
specific kinds of searches. You can also use this program to use google
as a proxy.
<u>Skipfish:</u>

A fully automated, active web application security reconnaissance tool.
Key features: High speed: pure C code, highly optimized HTTP handling,
minimal CPU footprint - easily achieving 2000 requests per second with
responsive targets. Ease of use: heuristics to support a variety of
quirky web frameworks and mixed-technology sites, with automatic
learning capabilities, on-the-fly wordlist creation, and form
autocompletion. Cutting-edge security logic: high quality, low false
positive, differential security checks, capable of spotting a range of
subtle flaws, including blind injection vectors.

''' PROGRAM ''' <b>18:00 - 18:30 Check-In (catering included)</b>
<b>18:30 - 18:45 Introduction (OWASP organization, projects,
sponsor)</b>
<b>18.45 - 19.45 Web Application Firewalls in dynamic
environments</b>(by Alexander Meisel)
Alexander Meisel is the CTO of 'art of defence' (AOD), a German based
software vendor. The company specializes in high performance deployments
of Web Application Firewalls in very dynamic environments all over the
world.

Abstract: The current trend towards cloud computing forces everybody to
deploy services in a virtual environment. In current dedicated
environments WAFs or Web Application Firewalls are mostly deployed as a
hardware (black) box which is easy at first but limits them to only low
performance web cluster architectures. Moving those systems virtualized
into a cloud environment makes almost no sense because of the resource
limitations. The is solution is a redesign which enables WAFs to be part
of a true message based cloud system. This talk explains how truly
virtualized and distributed web applications are architected, work and
scale in high performance environments.
<b>19.45 – 20.00 Break</b>
<b>20.00 - 21:00 Bypassing Web Application Firewalls </b>(by Sandro
Gauci)
Sandro Gauci is the owner and Founder of EnableSecurity
(www.enablesecurity.com) where he performs R\&D and security consultancy
for mid-sized companies. Sandro has over 9 years experience in the
security industry and is focused on analysis of security challenges and
providing solutions to such threats. Hispassion is vulnerability
research and has previously worked together with various endors such as
Microsoft and Sun to fix security holes. Sandro is the author of the
free VoIP security scanning suite SIPVicious (sipvicious.org) and
VOIPPACK for CANVAS.

Abstract: WAFs or Web Application Firewalls are being deployed to fix
security issues in your web applications. The question is, are they? In
this presentation we take a look at some of the issues related to making
use of this solution and how it may affect the overall security posture
of your web application. Finally we will describe tools to automate
detection of WAFs, and also tools to help identify ways to bypass WAFs.
This presentation will include updates to the open source WAF security
testing tools - WAFFIT.

<b>18:30 - 18:45 Introduction (OWASP organization, projects,
sponsor)</b>
<b>18.45 - 19.45 SQL Injection - How far does the rabbit hole go?</b>
(By Justin Clarke)
<b>Justin Clarke</b> is a co-founder and Director at Gotham Digital
Science, based in the United Kingdom. He has over twelve years of
experience in assessing the security of networks, web applications, and
wireless networks for large financial, retail, technology and government
clients in the United States, the United Kingdom and New Zealand. Justin
is the the technical editor and lead author of “SQL Injection Attacks
and Defense” (Syngress 2009), co-author of "Network Security Tools:
Writing, Hacking, and Modifying Security Tools" (O’Reilly 2005), a
contributing author to "Network Security Assessment: Know Your Network,
2nd Edition" (O’Reilly 2007), as well as a speaker at a number of
conferences and events on security topics, including Black Hat USA,
EuSecWest, OSCON, ISACA, RSA, SANS, OWASP, and the British Computer
Society. He is the author of the open source SQLBrute blind SQL
injection testing tool, and is the Chapter Leader for the London chapter
of OWASP. SQl Injection - How far does the rabbit hole go? SQL Injection
has been around for over 10 years, and yet it is still to this day not
truly understood by many security professionals and developers. With the
recent mass attacks against sites across the world it has again come to
the fore of vulnerabilities under the spotlight, however many consider
it to only be a data access issue, or parameterized queries to be a
panacea.
This talk starts from what was demonstrated last year at Black Hat in
Las Vegas, where a self propagating SQL Injection worm was demonstrated
live on stage. Explore some of the deeper, darker areas of SQL
Injection, hybrid attacks, and exploiting obscure database
functionality

<b>19.45 – 20.00 Break</b>
<b>20. 00 – 20.30 VAC Insecure Direct Object Reference</b> (By Marinus
Kuivenhoven)
<b>Marinus Kuivenhoven</b> is a Senior Technology Specialist with Sogeti
Nederland B.V. specializing in service oriented architectures and secure
application development. His experience include developing and
administrating Oracle-based systems. At Sogeti Nederland B.V. he is also
an active member of the PaSS -Software(Proactive Security Strategy)
taskforce focusing on secure application development. Marinus also
developed and teaches several application security courses both within
and outside Sogeti. In the past years he has written for magazine such
as Computable and We Love IT. And he has spoken on a number of
conferences and events like OWASP, Recent OO Trends, Open Source
Developer Conference and Engineering World. <b>Vulnerability:</b>
Insecure Direct Object Reference is when a web application exposes an
internal implementation object to the user. Some examples of internal
implementation objects are database records, URLs, or files.
<b>Attack:</b> An attacker can modify the internal implementation object
in an attempt to abuse the access controls on this object. When the
attacker does this they may have the ability to access functionality
that the developer didn’t intend to expose access to.
<b>Countermeasure:</b> Reference should be validated for authorization
and accessed through reference maps. How this should be done will be
shown.

<b>20.30 – 21.15 Overlooked Resources and Practices</b> (By Justin
Clarke)
In his second presentation, Justin Clarke discussed OWASP resources and
best practices by highlighting some OWASP projects and underused
security practices. He shared his experiences in his daily work as well
as the known pitfalls.

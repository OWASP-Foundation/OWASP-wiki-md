## OWASP Learning Gateway Project

The OWASP Learning Gateway Project (OLG) is developing a collaborative
learning innovation framework and platform that empower mentoring, and
are adaptable to “Learners Led”, collaborative learning needs and user
requirements of a global community of technology “Learners at All
Levels”. The learning innovation gateway is being designed to offer
learning pathways that connect learners with mentors, sponsors, learning
opportunities, experiential knowledge, and wisdom. Our goal is to be a
successful OWASP Foundation Incubator, and Science Gateways Community
Institute (SGCI) Incubator, Gateways Project for the benefit of our
community of "Learner Innovators" while implementing "Learners Led" and
"Learners at All Levels" approaches to mentoring.

# FAQs

## How can I participate in your project?

All you have to do is make the Project Leader's aware of your available
time to contribute to the project. It is also important to let the
Leader's know how you would like to contribute and pitch in to help the
project meet it's goals and milestones. There are many different ways
you can contribute to an OWASP Project, but communication with the leads
is key.

## If I am not a programmer can I participate in your project?

Yes, you can certainly participate in the project if you are not a
programmer or technical. The project needs different skills and
expertise and different times during its development. Currently, we are
looking for researchers, writers, graphic designers, and a project
administrator.

# Road Map and Getting Involved

## Roadmap

As of <strong>November, 2016, the highest priorities for the next 6
months</strong> are: <strong>

  - [UX Research
    Plan](https://github.com/OWASP/OWASP-Learning-Gateway/issues/39)
  - Setup the Datamodel (90% done)
  - Design feedback system
  - Design & Develop API Strategy and Framework
  - Implement Internationalization Support
  - Add Unit Tests for critical procedures:
      - integrate courses
      - connect to mentor
  - Transfer project to a Github Organization (done)
  - Develop privacy policy

\-- Completed

  - Complete the first draft of the Code Project Template (done)

</strong>

## Getting Involved

Involvement in the development and promotion of <strong>Code Project
Template</strong> is actively encouraged\! You do not have to be a
security expert or a programmer to contribute. Some of the ways you can
help are as follows:

### Coding

OWASP Learning Gateway Github:
<https://github.com/OWASP/OWASP-Learning-Gateway>

### Grants

<https://www.owasp.org/images/4/4b/Learning-Gateway-Proposal-Gateways2016-submissions.pdf>

### Financials and Resources

<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C73YMjMCpkh1g9-R4D_6e_u_Q5SpZBKSIl6yR29-fUw/edit#gid=0>

### Whiteboard

### Localization

Are you fluent in another language? Can you help translate the text
strings in the <strong>Code Project Template</strong> into that
language?

### Testing

Do you have a flair for finding bugs in software? We want to product a
high quality product, so any help with Quality Assurance would be
greatly appreciated. Let us know if you can offer your help.

### Feedback

Please attend Virtual Mentors Committee meetings (
<https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Brooklyn/events/240623169/> )for feedback
about:

  - What do you like?
  - What don't you like?
  - What features would you like to see prioritized on the roadmap?

# Minimum Viable Product

The Code Project Template must specify the minimum set of tabs a project
should have, provide some an example layout on each tab, provide
instructional text on how a project leader should modify the tab, and
give some example text that illustrates how to create an actual project.

It would also be ideal if the sample text was translated into different
languages.

# Project About

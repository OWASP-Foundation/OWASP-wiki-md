# Minutes

Start: 2200 GMT

  - Need to apply Project Assessment Criteria to deliveries rather than
    projects. By distinguishing between projects and deliverables, we
    can still have "release quality" projects that are "inactive". This
    also addresses Projects that are not either "tools" or "docs" -
    project itself will be subject to certain criteria and the
    deliverables will be subject to the appropriate criteria.
  - Need some vocabulary to describe projects vs. releases/deliverables
  - Need to launch SoC by May 1st; projects chosen by June 1st to allow
    enough time for projects to build before OWASP Summit in Jan 2010
  - Decrease delay in action by requesting comments directly on email
    instead of waiting for calls
  - Proposal to projects that don't fall under Tools or Docs will, as
    part of their proposal, identify criteria that applies to their
    project

End: 2345 GMT

Below are tips that chapter leaders can use to increase attendance for
their meetings:

  - Make sure that the person sending out invitations to upcoming
    meetings is employed by a large enterprise. Generally speaking,
    people whom work for large employers tend to have access to a larger
    distribution list than those who are employed by small software
    vendors and consulting firms.
  - When sending out invitations, use Outlook calendar invites. General
    email assumes that people will read it in a timely manner and will
    remember to transcribe it onto their calendar. By using Outlook,
    this task is done for them.
  - Make sure that your upcoming meeting is broadcast through a variety
    of channels. You should minimally blog it and ideally also post on
    social networking sites such as [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/)
    as well.
  - Post your event to many of the event sites such as [Yahoo
    Events](http://events.yahoo.com/)
  - Acknowledge the fact that even if people cannot physically attend,
    they may be able to participate remotely. Consider using free
    conferencing services such as [Free
    Conference](http://www.freeconference.com/)
  - Partner with other user groups and agree to cross-market. I share
    events related to our local [Java SIG](http://www.ctjava.org/), .NET
    SIG, ISSA, SIM and DAMA events. Reciprocity takes you a long way.
  - Be somewhat selective in your choice of speakers. If you choose a
    speaker from a large software firm such as Microsoft, Oracle or HP,
    their marketing people will actually assist you in marketing your
    event. They have better distribution lists and more importantly a
    larger marketing budget to help spread the word.
  - Are you familiar with Maslow's hiearchy of needs? Many people are
    tired and hungry especially after a long day at work. While you
    cannot cure tiredness, you can at least figure out how to feed them.
    Pizza is cheap and it is relatively easy to find a sponsor.
  - IT people are easily tricked into attending events by simply telling
    them that chotskies' will be available. Many large software vendors
    will supply them to you free of charge.
  - Make sure the topics you choose are broadly applicable and not just
    targeted at software developers. Part of making web application
    security visible requires you to choose speakers that appeal to IT
    Executives, Enterprise Architects, Business Analysts, Legal and
    Compliance, etc.
  - Take yourself less seriously. Many people are way too stuffy and
    stressed. People learn better when they are having fun. Make jokes,
    learn to laugh at yourself and most importantly, we need to help
    others do the same.

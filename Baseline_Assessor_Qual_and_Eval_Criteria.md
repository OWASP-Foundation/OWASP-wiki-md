This project article’s focus is to establish common set of assessor
qualifications and evaluation criteria to facilitate end service user
ability to determine competence per assessment type. Agreement and
establishment of these qualifications and criteria are foundational to
establishing the Assessment Levels later within this project.

## Baseline Assessor Qualifications for Expert Testing

Prior to hiring a firm or before hiring internally, verify and ensure on
individual basis each Assessor has the following skills:

  - 4+ years of technical security experience with multiple computer
    platforms, operating systems, software products, network protocols
    and system architecture.
  - Knowledge of security architecture methodologies, industry best
    practices and generally accepted information security principles.
  - Demonstrated ability to secure (lock-down/harden) underlying
    operating systems and web services such as IIS or Apache – Thus
    inverse ability to break into insecure systems.
  - Demonstrated experience in designing and integrating security
    services (authentication, authorization, encryption, integrity, and
    non-repudiation) into systems and/or applications.
      - Demonstrated ability to recognize MD5 from Base64 from an
        encrypted value visually. (Example to demonstrate depth of
        knowledge in encryption)
  - Demonstrated experience in conducting vulnerability assessments and
    penetration testing – Seen as foundational skills to application
    level testing.
      - Demonstrated evidence of vulnerability discoveries (new
        undiscovered vulnerability).
      - Demonstrated ability to interpret a generated report from
        vulnerability scanners and quickly recognize potential false
        positives.
      - Able to demonstrate any exploit used during a test if requested
        by a client.
  - Solid understanding and experience in Web application and Internet
    security.
  - Solid, in-depth understanding of all Internet and Web protocols.
  - Full understanding of major HTML directives and code.
  - Knowledge of Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) and SOAP if
    applicable to environment.
  - Demonstrated ability to reverse engineer a transactional web
    application.
  - Produces own security tools known in reputable security circles.
    Ability to shell code to automate custom tests.
  - Demonstrated use of testing methodologies defined in OWASP Testing
    Project – Ask for specific testing process used for three or more
    testing areas.
  - Demonstrated ability to create and follow a project specific well
    documented test plan.
  - Programming / web services development experience a benefit.
    However, not all programmers make good security testers (it’s a
    mindset thing).
  - Demonstrated ability to formulate written technical material in a
    clear and effective manner – Ask for writing sample.

Assessors identify and exploit security weaknesses, evaluate
counter-measures and conduct analysis to determine potential security
impacts to business. More so, the assessor must demonstrate ability to
take assessment data and formulate security technical solutions.

The following education and/or certifications are helpful and increase
the viability of the Assessor (establishes their business foundation
skills thus ability to link technical results to business impact) but
should not be taken as sole means for evaluating.

  - Undergraduate degree in Computer Science, Information Systems,
    Engineering, or related discipline
  - CISSP or CCNA or GIAC certifications

**Evaluation Criteria**

The following matrix is intended to summarize the skills required per
assessment level.

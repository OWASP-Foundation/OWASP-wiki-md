To get to a first stable release there are still a few things that need
to be completed:

  - A full documentation of the framework architecture and a user
    manual.
  - A bug tracking system
  - An implementation of a summary that can contain custom error
    messages and that is easy to query. The idea is to generate the
    summary in XML and use the standard XML tools to query it.
  - More standard annotations

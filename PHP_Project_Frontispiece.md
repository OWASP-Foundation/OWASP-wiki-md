# Introduction

This guide is designed to be used by developers so they can write secure
PHP programs. Unlike many, OWASP believes that given enough effort,
systems written in PHP can be made secure. This guide does not offer any
methods to attack PHP software, but provides safer alternatives to avoid
common problems.

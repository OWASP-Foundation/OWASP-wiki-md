FIXME: This category should replace the [:Category:Environmental
Problem](:Category:Environmental_Problem "wikilink").

This category includes everything that is outside of the source code but
is still critical to the security of the product that is being created.
Because the issues covered by this kingdom are not directly related to
source code, we separated it from the rest of the kingdoms.

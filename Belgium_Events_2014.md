  - 20h00 - 20h15: **Break**
  - 20h15 - 20h30: **[Investigating software security
    practices](https://www.owasp.org/images/6/61/Investigating_software_security_practices-2014-12-17-OWASP-BE.pdf)**
    (by Koen Yskout and Laurens Sion, iMinds-DistriNet)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *Abstract:* Security must be considered throughout the whole
    software development cycle, including early phases such as
    requirements elicitation and software design. While this is a widely
    accepted statement, it is not evident to achieve this in practice.
    Although some academic proposals along this line exist, they are not
    used in industry. As academics, before making any new proposals, we
    want to perform a survey in order to understand to what degree
    security and privacy are currently present in the requirements
    elicitation and architecture and design activities of organizations,
    how they are incorporated in practice, and what the benefits and
    limitations of the existing approaches are.
    In this short talk, we will explore why such a study is needed, what
    our goal is, and why you should participate.

  - 20h30 - 21h30: **OpenSAMM Best Practices: Lessons from the
    Trenches** (by Sebastien Deleersnyder and Bart De Win)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *Abstract:* Managing all application security activities as part of
    development and deployment of applications can be an overwhelming
    challenge. OWASP OpenSAMM gives you a structural and measurable
    blueprint to integrate OWASP best practices in your software life
    cycle. This OWASP framework allows you to formulate and implement a
    strategy for software security that is tailored to the risk profile
    of your organisation.
    During this talk Bart and Sebastien will get you up to speed on the
    OpenSAMM framework and share their important challenges they faced
    in implementing the framework within various organisations.
    Important topics that will be covered during this presentation are:
      - What is the optimal OpenSAMM maturity level for your
        organisation?
      - At which level to implement OpenSAMM in the organisation: at
        company, business unit or development team level?
      - How to integrate OpenSAMM activities in agile development?
      - How to apply OpenSAMM on suppliers or outsourced development?
      - What metrics does OpenSAMM provide to manage your secure
        development life cycle?
    Practical lessons learned and use cases from the trenches that make
    OWASP OpenSAMM a valuable methodology and which you should apply for
    your secure development life cycle\!

    *Abstract:* In this talk Tiago Teles takes apart password protection
    scheme analyzing the attack resistance of hashes, hmacs, adaptive
    hashes (such as script), and encryption schemes. First, we present a
    threat model for password storage. Then audience members will learn
    the construction, performance, and protective properties of these
    primitives. Discussion of the primitives will be from a critical
    perspective modeled as an iterative secure design session.
    Ultimately, this session presents the solution and code donated as
    part an on-going OWASP project – a OWASP PSM (password storage
    module). Discussion of this solution will include key techniques for
    hardening PSM learned through years of delivering production JavaEE
    code to customers…

    malware](https://www.owasp.org/images/7/7b/A_history_of_ATM_violence_-_OWASP_Chapter_Night.pdf)**
    (by Daan Raman and Erik Van Buggenhout)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *Abstract:* ATMs (Automated Teller Machines) are the main component
    of self-servicing banking functions used by millions of banking
    customers worldwide. To put things in perspective, 400,000 ATM
    devices were deployed in Europe alone as of 30 June 2013. Worldwide,
    the number of ATMs grew from 1.7 million to 2.5 million between 2007
    and 2013.
    This entertaining talk on attacks against Automated Teller Machines
    (ATMs) will focus on the history of ATM attacks and the current
    development of cross-vendor ATM malware. The talk will include a
    presentation of our from-scratch developed ATM malware that will be
    presented on a live ATM system (see <http://youtu.be/MBOD59r3lTM>).
    *Bio:* Daan Raman and Erik Van Buggenhout are security consultants
    at NVISO, where they focus on information security topics in the

## Previous Meeting (12th of February 2014) in Leuven

### WHEN

12th of February 2014 (18h00 - 21h00)

### WHERE

Jointly organized with [SecAppDev](http://www.secappdev.org/). Hosted by
[iMinds-Distrinet Research Group (KU
Leuven)](https://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be).

Both speakers are faculty of the [Secure Application
Development](http://www.secappdev.org/) course which is held in Leuven
from 10 to 14 February 2014. OWASP Members get a 10% discount to attend
the course.

Address:
Department of Computer Science (foyer at ground floor)
Celestijnenlaan 200 A
3001 Heverlee ([google

Routemap: <https://distrinet.cs.kuleuven.be/about/route/>

### Last minute update:

I would like to notify you that due to traffic work you most probably
will have to make a detour to get to the university campus.

Because of a road block at the Celestijnenlaan, this street has become
one way. This forces participants coming from the E40/Koning
Boudewijnlaan to reach the campus via the ring
(R23)/Naamsesteenweg/Kardinaal Mercierlaan.

A map of the detour can be found here: <http://goo.gl/maps/kZqEQ>

As this is the only way to get to the campus, take into account that it
may lead to significant delays.

    privacy](https://www.owasp.org/images/f/f8/Danezis-owasp14.pptx)**
    (by George Danezis)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *Abstract:* In the past few years tremendous cryptographic progress
    has been made in relation to primitives for privacy
    friendly-computations. These include celebrated results around fully
    homomorphic encryption, faster somehow homomorphic encryption, and
    ways to leverage them to support more efficient secret-sharing based
    secure multi-party computations. Similar break-through in verifiable
    computation, and succinct arguments of knowledge, make it practical
    to verify complex computations, as part of privacy-preserving client
    side program execution. Besides computations themselves, notions
    like differential privacy attempt to capture the essence of what it
    means for computations to leak little personal information, and have
    been mapped to existing data query languages.
    So, is the problem of computation on private data solved, or just
    about to be solved? In this talk, I argue that the models of generic
    computation supported by cryptographic primitives are complete, but
    rather removed from what a typical engineer or data analyst expects.
    Furthermore, the use of these cryptographic technologies impose
    constrains that require fundamental changes in the engineering of
    computing systems. While those challenges are not obviously
    cryptographic in nature, they are nevertheless hard to overcome,
    have serious performance implications, and errors open avenues for
    attack.
    Throughout the talk I use examples from our own work relating to
    privacy-friendly computations within smart grid and smart metering
    deployments for private billing, privacy-friendly aggregation,
    statistics and fraud detection. These experiences have guided the
    design of ZQL, a cryptographic language and compiler for
    zero-knowledge proofs, as well as more recent tools that compile
    using secret-sharing based primitives.

  - 20h15 - 21h15: **[Securing Complex
    Forms](https://www.owasp.org/images/d/db/HTML_Forms_and_Workflows_v3.pdf)**
    (by Jim Manico)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *Abstract:* The heart of how users interact with a web application
    is the HTML form submission. A great deal of very sensitive data
    flows over HTML forms. Securing web form submissions is critical for
    the construction of a secure web application. Multi-form workflows
    make securing form submissions even more complicated\! This
    presentation will take you on a journey as untrusted data flows from
    a form submission into the many layers of a secure web application.
      - Review some of the basic threats against web forms
      - Learn some of the most important defense categories for building
        secure web forms
      - Discuss some of the more complex aspects to form construction,
        such as workflow
    *Bio:* Jim Manico is the VP of Security Architecture at WhiteHat
    Security. Jim has been a web application developer since 1997. He
    has also been an active member of OWASP since 2008 supporting
    projects that help developers write secure code.

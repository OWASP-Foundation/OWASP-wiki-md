## What is FxCop?

FxCop is a free code analysis tool developed by Microsoft, use to
analyze MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language) generated from any
managed language (including C\# and VB.NET).

FxCop is a standalone .NET 2.0 application, downloadable from the
locations referenced below. A modified version of the FxCop codebase is
integrated into Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 and 2008. While the
rulebase for each is mostly the same, there are notable differences
between the two (see the Rules comparison spreadsheet
[below](FxCop#References "wikilink")), and the compiled format for
custom rules is different; thus, one cannot generally develop custom
rules that can be used natively in both contexts.

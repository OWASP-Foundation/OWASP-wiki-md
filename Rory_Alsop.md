Rory is a Senior Manager for Ernst & Young in Edinburgh, where he has
focused on Information Security for the last 9 years. He manages large
scale security programmes, including global attack & penetration
engagements, privacy and security assessments, incident response and
fraud and forensic investigations, with a key focus on appropriate
controls across the enterprise - taking a 'holistic' view of security
and resilience which translates directly to practical cost effective
security solutions.

He presents regularly on Ethical Hacking, Online Fraud, Enterprise
Governance, Risks and Threats and other Information Security topics and
has published security articles for business readers in the Financial
Times and other journals.

He is also the chair of the Scottish Branch of the Institute of
Information Security Professionals (IISP) and Vice President of ISACA
Scotland and sits on the Operations Committee of the Council of
Registered Ethical Security Testers (CREST), all of which enable his
other roles as security mentor and practical security evangelist.

registered CLAS consultant.

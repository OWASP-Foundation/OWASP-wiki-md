    Foundation
2.  Unify: Create and nurture a shared culture of success within the
    community
3.  Grow: Increase reputation of Foundation that will grow involvement
    and influence

## Staff Projects

Staff Project are work product primarily done by staff that require
either 40+hrs of staff time or have a financial obligation of more than
$10,000. **Active** Staff Projects have written plans that include
measurable goals, milestones, and should be linked below.
**Prioritized** Staff Projects are in the formation stages and are
listed in rank importance. **Unprioritized** Staff Projects are items
that lack a plan and are in a "bucket list" until they get prioritized
with a project plan. *Note this project list is not the exhaustive list
of staff daily work product. These are the key projects above everyday
work that is purposefully planned to deliver on 2019 Goals.* Generally
the process we will use to implement our plans are:

*`'``   ``Concept``   ``>>``   ``Document``   ``>>``   ``Socialize``
 ``>>``   ``Iterate``   ``>>``   ``[Approval``   ``if``   ``needed]``
 ``>>``   ``Plan``   ``>>``   ``Implement``   ``>>``   ``Report``
 ``>>``   ``Revisit`*`'`

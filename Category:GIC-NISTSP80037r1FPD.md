## Prologue

"...*Through the process of risk management, leaders must consider risk
to U.S. interests from adversaries using cyberspace to their advantage
and from our own efforts to employ the global nature of cyberspace to
achieve objectives in military, intelligence, and business
operations*..."

</center>

<center>

"...*For operational plans development, the combination of threats,
vulnerabilities, and impacts must be evaluated in order to identify
important trends and decide where effort should be applied to eliminate
or reduce threat capabilities; eliminate or reduce vulnerabilities; and
assess, coordinate, and deconflict all cyberspace operations*..."

<center>

"...*Leaders at all levels are accountable for ensuring readiness and
security to the same degree as in any other domain*..."

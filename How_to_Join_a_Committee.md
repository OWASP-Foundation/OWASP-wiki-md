The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a worldwide free
and open community focused on improving the security of application
software. Our mission is to make application security "visible," so that
people and organizations can make informed decisions about application
security risks. Everyone is free to participate in OWASP and all of our
materials are available under a free and open software license. The
OWASP Foundation is a 501c3 not-for-profit charitable organization that
ensures the ongoing availability and support for our work.

Many individuals start with OWASP as a user of a user of tools guides or
attending a local chapter. meeting. From that they may become a
individual project leader of new tools guides contributing their
expertise. Others may choose to become a active chapter leader in a
state/region. Becoming a member of one of the Global Committees is not
only a great achievement in the technical community, but is an
opportunity to directly impact the future of OWASP Foundation globally.
As a Global Committee member you are the voice for focus areas and
represent the community around the world. The Global Committees ARE
designed to develop a committee plan to focus on regional and global
areas of improvement. Ideally you nominate a peer as a regional
spokesperson and he/she is the conduit for global issues that has
approx., 5-10+ hrs per month to volunteer time to OWASP Foundation.

To encourage focus and participation, we suggest that volunteers
contribute to **ONE PRIMARY COMMITTEE**. Individuals are **welcome to
participate** in whatever committee they would like to on efforts,
conference calls etc., but may only be officially elected to serve on
one committee.

  - Note that to prevent conflict of interest, International OWASP Board
    Members cannot endorse candidates for any committee nor can a
    committee member endorse a candidate for their own committee and
    each committee should only having (1) person from the same company.
    Committee members may endorse candidates for other committees to
    which they do not belong.

  - Committee members are eligible to transfer between committees, it is
    recommended annually.

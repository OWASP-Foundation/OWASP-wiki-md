### Agenda

  - Joining chapter & membership
  - Membership tackling leadership & members status
  - Top Down Direction
  - Get Involved Program

### Minutes

  - **Leadership Status** - Membership will take on responsibility for
    managing leadership/honorary/membership/supporter statuses,
    benefits, requirements
  - Probably not going to get too much top down feedback. We set
    direction & goals.
  - Need to work on membership retention.
  - No vote from committee on joining chapter & membership together
  - Discuss topics via email throughout the month to keep discussion
    going. We should copy the list and remember that we will get
    feedback from mailing list. Need to send a prep email to list
    letting them know the feedback is helpful and we will make the
    ultimate decision. If they are interested in the decision making
    then they too should join the committee.
  - **"Get Involved Program"** - need volunteers for various OWASP
    activities (project help, logo design, web site design, PR, conf
    planning). Membership retention tie to membership committee. This is
    something we should tackle. Its a big win for OWASP and greatly
    increases membership value and involvement with OWASP.
  - Summit - Date to be announced soon. Global Membership Committee to
    start generating ideas. Big talking points include Membership model,
    Leadership Status, Get Involved Program
  - 40% allocation to chapters - chapter leaders can spend chapter money
    on owasp shwag

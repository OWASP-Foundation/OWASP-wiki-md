## Provisory list of 'Accommodation + meals paid' participants

  - **In what respects to the level of expenses that will be paid, the
    following rules have been established:**

<!-- end list -->

1.  With the exceptions below, all accommodation and meal expenses,
    during all the four days (4th - 7th November 2008), will be paid.
2.  As we are still seeking out for financial sponsorship support, until
    further notice, none of the dinners will be paid.
3.  The meals consist of a pre-negotiated menu and just this will be
    paid.
4.  The accommodation will consist in a place in a shared T 1 (3 people)
    or T2 (5 people) apartment. Therefore, even though one can choose an
    individual room, OWASP will pay only for the cost associated with a
    shared stay.
5.  Please note that the nights of 3 and 7 of Nov will be included in
    the paid accommodation for those of you attending the whole event.
6.  The flight expenses will not be paid.

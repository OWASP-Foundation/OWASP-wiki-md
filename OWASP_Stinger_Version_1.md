## Overview

The J2EE platform does not include any validation features. This leaves
many organizations to craft their own validation mechanisms, often
incomplete, flawed, and inefficient. The basic idea is to define
validation rules for the headers, cookies, and parameters of an HTTP
request. These rules are specified in simple XML files using the
'Security Validation Definition Language.'

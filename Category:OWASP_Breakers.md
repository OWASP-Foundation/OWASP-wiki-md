# OWASP Breakers

This page contains a listing of projects within the OWASP
[Breakers](Breakers "wikilink") community.

To add your project to this page simply include the [breakers template
tag](Template:OWASP_Breakers "wikilink") in your projects wiki page.

Please note - The intention of the tags is for project organization
based on overall project purpose (builders, breakers, defenders). As
such there are no requirements that must be met in order to add the
template tag. Project review and prioritization occurs within the
community itself and will be called out on the community pages.

# Introduction

The goal of this document is to create high level guideline for secure
coding practices. The goal is to keep the overall size of the document
condensed and easy to digest. Individuals seeking addition information
on the specific areas should refer to the included links to learn more.

# How To Use This Document

The information listed below are generally acceptable secure coding
practices; however, it is recommend that organizations consider this a
base template and update individual sections with secure coding
recommendations specific to the organization's policies and risk
tolerance.

# Secure Coding Policy

Always maintain a secure coding policy. List down the activities that
are related to maintenance of secure coding standards (would these
standards be technology specific or technology agnostic), feedback of
code review output to training, input data validation, output data
validation etc

Why should you be having a secure coding policy? It helps in maintaining
consistency across organisation and helps in vertical and horizontal
scaling of usage of standards for web development projects.

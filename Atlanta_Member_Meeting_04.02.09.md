**WHAT**: Tony UV will provide an overview to the chapter, OWASP as a
global security organization, and review current tools and projects that
can be leveraged by developers, security pros, and even middle
management. Food will be provided, hopefully in the form of fermented
liquids. Social activities to follow event.

**COST**: Nothing, however we ask that you make a charitable donation
for the "food" to be provided in the form of (a) cash donations at the

network and growing list of projects, tools, and frameworks that are
provided.

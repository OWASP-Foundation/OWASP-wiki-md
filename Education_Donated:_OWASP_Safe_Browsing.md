The following presenation was donated by Matt Tesauro to the Education
project

[OWASP Safe
Browsing](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Image:OWASP-Safe-Browsing.ppt)

This is from October 2008 so some of the "news" type information is
dated but otherwise this is a very workable presentation. There's a
slide or two that either directly say demo or hint at it. If you have
questions about what I demo'ed or the slide deck in general, please feel
free to email me directly.

One of the goals for the month of October was to coordinate and execute
the Browser Security and Web Application Framework workshops at the EU
Summit. We were unsuccessful in gathering browser vendors and framework
developers into the room due to the late notice. Both workshops went
well.

The Browser Security workshop elicited a lot of useful discussion about
what the group should be doing, how vendors should be interfaced, and
identifying key recommendations for the browsers. A vendor that wasn't
formally invited also showed up and helped us understand vendor
perspective. At the end of the workshop we had a filled out Google Docs
matrix of browser security features and a list of recommendations and a
draft of the open letter to browser vendors.

The Web Application Framework was a real working session, with
participants helping generate a Google Doc that compared all the major
web application frameworks and identifying gaps that members can now
reach out to framework groups to fill. Some very interesting things were
learned.

A secondary goal of October was to perform more in-house advertisement
of the ISWG since it's still relatively unknown. ISWG was advertised on
stage several times at OWASP NYC and marketed heavily at the internal
OWASP EU.

The goals for November and December include:

  - Publishing the working documents currently on Google docs (and
    answer the question â€“ wiki vs. Google Docs?)
  - Revise the ISWG charter after discussion in Portugal
  - Deliver open letter to browser community through Dark Reading, other
    media outlets
  - Continue fostering discussion on ISWG mailing list

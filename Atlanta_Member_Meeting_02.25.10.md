'''ABSTRACT:: ''' This talk will cover malicious JavaScript currently
being used in the wild. It will start with the big daddy of embedded
malicious JavaScript, Asprox, which last year gave rise to panicked
headlines like "100,000s of websites compromised" and continuing through
more recent samples such as the fake Yahoo Counter and the recent
MS09-002 exploits. We will look at attack vectors, obfuscation
techniques, and multi-stage delivery systems, and exploits used. This
will feature the analysis of several samples harvest from the wilds of
the Internet.

Bio: My name is Nick Chapman. I'm a security researcher with the
SecureWorks Counter-Threat Unit. Prior to focusing on security issues
full time, I worked as both a System Administrator and Network Engineer
in the ISP world.

Everyone needs a web application firewall (WAF), but the lack of
standardised evaluation criteria is making the selection process
unnecessarily difficult and clouded in mystery. This session will
discuss which WAF features really matter, how to customise the work of
the Web Application Firewall Evaluation Criteria project, and how to use
the customised criteria to select the best product.

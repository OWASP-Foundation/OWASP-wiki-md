#### OWASP Newsletter \#1 â€“ December 1st 2006 to December 31st 2006

**Welcome to 2007 from all of us at OWASP\!**

I would like to take a moment to welcome you all to our first edition of
the OWASP newsletter and introduce myself. My name is Aaron Holmes and I
have had the pleasure of working on the OWASP website as part of the
OWASP Autumn of Code (AoC) 2006. It has been a rewarding and educational
experience for myself, and I feel OWASP has benefited greatly by the
many excellent projects which have been developed and advanced through
the AoC 2006 program. With all this activity and excitement, we have
decided that we should produce and distribute a regular newsletter to
keep everyone up to date on the direction of OWASP and our many great
projects. We invite your feedback and news submissions which can be
submitted to aholmes@owasp.org and dinis.cruz@owasp.net. Enjoy\!

In the next newsletter we will take a deeper look to the AoC projects
and explain how they can benefit you.

Until next week, happy coding\!

Aaron M. Holmes OWASP Newsletter Editor and Website Developer

#### OWASP Autumn of Code (AoC) update

The end of 2006 marks an important time for OWASP with the successful
completion of the Autumn of Code 2006. Four of the nine original
projects have been completed and are now officially closed. The
completed projects include
[CAL9000](:Category:OWASP_CAL9000_Project "wikilink"), [OWASP
SiteGenerator](OWASP_SiteGenerator "wikilink"), [OWASP Report
Generator](OWASP_Report_Generator "wikilink"), the
[Testing_Guide](Testing_Guide "wikilink"), and the [Owasp.org Website
and Branding
project](OWASP_Autumn_of_Code_2006_-_Projects:_Website_and_Branding "wikilink").
Additionally, three other projects are up for completion and will be
finalized in the very near future; including
[Pantera](:Category:OWASP_Pantera_Web_Assessment_Studio_Project "wikilink")
(Web Assessment Studio Project), [new WebGoat
lessons](OWASP_Autumn_of_Code_2006_-_Projects:_Web_Goat "wikilink"), and
[OWASP
Tiger](OWASP_Autumn_of_Code_2006_-_Projects:_Owasp_.Net_Tools "wikilink")
(formally named Owasp.net Tools). The remaining two projects, [WebScarab
NX](OWASP_Autumn_of_Code_2006_-_Projects:_WebScarab_NG "wikilink") and
[LiveCD](OWASP_Autumn_of_Code_2006_-_Projects:_Live_CD "wikilink") have
been granted 2 month project extensions.

All projects have seen great developments which have been made possible
by the hard work and efforts of our AoC participants, project leaders,
community members and owasp membership fees (used to pay the AoC
sponsorships)

#### Featured Projects: ORG and OSG

[OWASP Report Generator](OWASP_Report_Generator "wikilink") (ORG) and
[OWASP Site Generator](OWASP_Site_Generator "wikilink")(OSG) are
projects that have recently been updated through the Autumn of Code.

[OWASP Report Generator](OWASP_Report_Generator "wikilink") (ORG) is
designed for security consultants and aims to aid the creation,
management and reporting of security audits (i.e. penetration testing,
security assessments, etc). With ORG you can centrally manage and track
security assessments projects, while reducing considerably the time
spent on non-testing activities. ORG allows for the easy (using Altova's
Authentic XML WYSIWYG editor) and quick: a) record/document findings, b)
create reports in multiple formats and c) track the findings till they
are fixed (additional features: Image copy and paste, Nmap import,
plug-in extension,automatic xsd schema verification, archiving and data
exports). All data is stored in XML files and all reports (in HTML, PDF,
Powerpoint or Excel) are created using XSL transformations.

[OWASP Site Generator](OWASP_Site_Generator "wikilink")(OSG) is a
teaching tool that can be used to create dynamic sites build from a
predefined list of vulnerabilities (data stored in XML files and new
dinamic websites loaded in seconds). This allows for security trainers
to show specific examples of problems and for developers to look at real
vulnerable code. It also will allow the assessment of the effectiveness
of Web Application Security Scanners and Web Application Firewalls.

#### Application Security News (from [here](Application_Security_News "wikilink") on owasp.org)

  - *' Jan 3 - [XSS in ALL sites with PDF
    download](http://www.gnucitizen.org/blog/danger-danger-danger/)*' -
    Critical XSS flaw that is trivial to exploit here in all but the
    very latest browsers. Attackers simply have to add a script like
    \#attack=<javascript:alert(document.cookie>); to ANY URL that ends
    in .pdf (or streams a PDF). Solution is to not use PDF's or for
    Adobe to patch the planet.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Dec 14 - [JavaScript error handler leaks
    information](http://jeremiahgrossman.blogspot.com/2006/12/i-know-if-youre-logged-in-anywhere.html)**
    - An attacker can find out whether you're logged into your favorite
    website or not. They include a script tag where the src attribute
    doesn't point to a script, but instead to a page on your favorite
    websites. Based on the error the script parser generates when trying
    to parse the HTML of the page that's returned, the attacker can tell
    whether you're logged in or not. Should extend to access control
    easily. Protect yourself with CSRF protection.

  - **Dec 13 - [UCLA spins massive
    breach](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/12/AR2006121200173.html)**
    - Why not just say what measures you've really taken? Are all
    developers trained? Do you do code review and security testing? "Jim
    Davis, UCLA's chief information officer, said a computer trespasser
    used a program designed to exploit an undetected software flaw to
    bypass all security measures and gain access to the restricted
    database that contains information on about 800,000 current and
    former students, faculty and staff, as well as some student
    applicants and parents of students or applicants who applied for
    financial aid. 'In spite of our diligence, a sophisticated hacker
    found and exploited a subtle vulnerability in one of hundreds of
    applications,' Davis said in the statement."

  - **Dec 10 - [MySpace and Apple
    mess](http://news.com.com/Security+Bites+Podcast+MySpace,+Apple+in+patch+snafu/2324-12640_3-6142120.html)**
    - MySpace and Apple show how NOT to handle security incidents (see
    also [How Not to Distribute Security
    Patches](http://blog.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2006/12/how_not_to_distribute_security_1.html))

<!-- end list -->

  - **Dec 2 - [Oracle blames security
    researchers](http://blogs.oracle.com/security/2006/11/27#a39)** -
    "We do not credit security researchers who disclose the existence of
    vulnerabilities before a fix is available. We consider such
    practices, including disclosing 'zero day' exploits, to be
    irresponsible." So the question on everybody's mind - is the Oracle
    Software Security Assurance program real? Or are David Litchfield
    and Cesar Cerrudo right that Emperor has no clothes?

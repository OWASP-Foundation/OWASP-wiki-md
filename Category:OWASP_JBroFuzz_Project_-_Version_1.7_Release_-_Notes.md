  - "Release Notes – this is to provide both reviewers and users an idea
    ‘what they are getting’ in the new release. It could double as (or
    be sourced from) the change log. Particularly for reviewers, this
    helps them focus their efforts on the new parts of the project. That
    should help project leads get eyeballs and feedback on their new
    code. Especially for large projects that have made previous
    releases, this is very useful. Think about the difference in effort
    between reviewing the Testing Guide as a whole vs looking at the 2
    new chapters and 20 minor additions.

How big to either of these have to be? As big as the project lead feels
they need to be to meet the purpose of them. Maybe 10 bullets, maybe 10
pages – its really the project leads choice. Also, project leads are in
the best position to know how much effort this should take."

Below you will find a series of guidelines aimed at assisting OWASP
Project Leaders with OWASP Project spending related questions. In order
to avoid any problems or misunderstandings in the future, we have
developed these guidelines to provide clear expectations of how OWASP
Projects should spend project funds, and what are appropriate project
expenses.

If you do not find it listed please use [us

## Guidelines

1.  OWASP Project funds are to be spent on project related expenses
    ONLY. If your project has more than one Project Leader, then all
    Project Leaders must agree to the expense before the purchase.
2.  Before a purchase is made, the Project Leader must make sure that
    his/her project actually has the funds to cover the purchase. The
    easiest way to do this is to communicate your purchase needs to the
    OWASP Projects Manager, or you can look at the running funds list
    provided by the foundation.
3.  Project expenses exceeding $500 USD must be communicated to the
    OWASP Projects Manager before the purchase.
4.  All project expenses will preferably be managed via a reimbursement
    process. Once a purchase is made, the purchaser must submit a
    reimbursement request using our reimbursement form. Note: A receipt
    is required for the reimbursement process to be successful.
5.  If reimbursement is not possible for a project, fill out the Contact
    Us form and request assistance with payment from the staff.
6.  Appropriate Project Expenses encompass the following: Graphic
    Design; Technical Contractor; Web Design; Printing; Software
    Purchase; Hardware Purchase; Intern Stipends; Team Travel Expenses
    (for project related work ONLY); Venue Hire (project related work
    only); Food and Drink (if used to meet with other project leaders,
    contributors, OWASP staff, or an OWASP related function); Project
    Contractor. Please check with the OWASP Projects Manager before you
    move forward with a purchase if your expense falls outside of the
    items listed above.
7.  All OWASP Projects are started with the understanding that they will
    be volunteer run, and they must remain volunteer run.
8.  In the event that a project’s Leaders decide they would like to hire
    a contractor to work on a particular aspect of the project, then the
    Project Leaders must manage the recruitment and payment on a
    task/work assignment basis. Contractors must be paid upon
    satisfactory completion of the task/work assignment. Additionally,
    the OWASP Projects Manager must be be informed that project funds
    will be used to hire a contractor for project development.
9.  Hiring Project Leaders as Contractors: If a project’s Leaders decide
    to hire another Leader as a contractor for a project task/work
    assignment, then the OWASP Projects Manager must be informed before
    work begins. Leaders must demonstrate to the OWASP PM that they have
    searched for 3rd party contractors, before the decision was reached
    to hire the Project Leader(s) as contractors.The contracted
    Leader(s) will be paid upon satisfactory completion of the work.
10. As of Jan 01, 2014, OWASP will add a disclaimer to the donation page
    which states that the foundation reserves the right to reallocate
    funds to the general Foundation income account. For all money
    received for projects prior to Jan 1st - OWASP will make best
    efforts to contact donors in respect to their donor intent before
    reallocating funds in the instance of inactive projects.

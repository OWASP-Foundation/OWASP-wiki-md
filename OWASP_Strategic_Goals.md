# 2017


**2017 OWASP Foundation Strategic Goal**




**1. Host 4 Mass Training Events**

**Goal**

Raise awareness of OWASP and spread application security knowledge
through 1-day OWASP Application Security trainings that are free for
members or non-members to attend.

**OWASP Foundation Objective**

1.  Delivery of 4 free AppSec trainings in multiple locations around the
    world
2.  AppSec trainings will be delivered by professional security trainers
    that have been selected from a public call for proposals process
    that is led by the OWASP foundation with a supporting team of OWASP
    volunteers for CFP evaluation
3.  Attendance for the OWASP AppSec Trainings will be free with OWASP
    members being given the first opportunity to RSVP. After the OWASP
    member registration window, then non-members will be able to
    register, space permitting, until capacity is reached
4.  To maximize attendance and minimize RSVP no-shows, a nominal
    registration fee will be required (\~$25 USD) that will be refunded
    to all RSVP individuals that show up at the event
5.  The goal for each location is for 500 attendees at the 6-8 hour
    security training
6.  The training deck and all materials will be branded as OWASP and
    will be made available on the OWASP website with open source
    licensing. These terms will be added to the CFP as requirements.

**Technical Depth**

The AppSec training course will cover application security core topics
and will be targeted towards developers and entry level application
security professionals. The purpose is to have the most impact and
attract the most number of attendees. While more advanced talks are
desired by many in the community, that is not the focus of this
objective.

**Budget Expectation**

The budget ask for this proposal is $80,000 USD. There is no anticipated
revenue from these events.

**Resource Expectation**

  - This program will be driven and owned by the OWASP foundation staff
    including selection of training cities, arrangement of training
    location and coordinating the RSVP process
  - OWASP volunteers will be used for the CFP trainer review
  - A worldwide OWASP volunteer team will be assembled to assist in any
    tasks as requested by the OWASP foundation staff

**Benefits**

  - Increase in OWASP membership - the priority registration and the
    value of OWASP will be demonstrated through this program leading
    towards more OWASP members
  - Increase in OWASP Awareness - this program will be paired with a PR
    campaign to raise awareness of the organization and our mission
  - Serving the OWASP mission - training 2000 engineers across the world
    is a great step towards our mission of raising security awareness

**Section 2 - Additional Operating Details**

The following details are provided as part of the operational plan to
execute on the objective. This section is not part of the board vote.

These details should be considered subject to change and is provided to
give additional background on the intent of this program.

**Event Locations**

1.  The 2017 Goal is to hold 4 events worldwide
2.  The priority will be to hold events in large cities that have
    established OWASP chapters and a large technical presence. The
    purpose is to start strong and eventually expand this program to
    more locations.
    1.  Boston
    2.  Delhi
    3.  Israel
    4.  Tokyo
3.  A proposed 2018 goal is to expand to additional cities and repeat
    the successful model within existing 2017 cities.

**Size**

For each event we should plan and drive towards 500 attendees. The goal
is to make a big impact and leverage this to drive OWASP membership
growth and PR for OWASP awareness worldwide.

**Cost**

$80,000 requested for 4 events within 2017

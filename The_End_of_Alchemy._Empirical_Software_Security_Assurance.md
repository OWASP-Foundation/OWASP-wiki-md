**The End of Alchemy**:
**Empirical Software Security Assurance**
By now everyone knows that security must be built in to software; it
cannot be bolted on. For more than a decade, scientists, visionaries,
and pundits have put forth a multitude of techniques and methodologies
for building secure software, but there has been little to recommend one
approach over another or to define the boundary between ideas that
merely look good on paper and ideas that actually get results. The
alchemists and wizards have put on a good show, but itâ€™s time to look at
the real empirical evidence.

This talk examines software security assurance as it is practiced today.
We will discuss popular methodologies and then, based on in-depth
interviews with leading enterprises such as Adobe, EMC, Google,
Microsoft, QUALCOMM, Wells Fargo, and Depository Trust Clearing
Corporation (DTCC), we present a set of benchmarks for developing and
growing an enterprise-wide software security initiative, including but
not limited to integration into the software development lifecycle
(SDLC). While all initiatives are unique, we find that the leaders share
a tremendous amount of common ground and wrestle with many of the same
problems. Their lessons can be applied in order to build a new effort
from scratch or to expand the reach of existing security capabilities.

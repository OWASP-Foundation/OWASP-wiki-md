# Minutes

(Meeting Start: 2100 GMT)

  - Agreed that there should be three levels to "releases": alpha, beta
    and "Level 3" (disagreement still exists on the name for "Level 3")
  - Agreed that there should be two levels to "projects": "Level 1" and
    "Level 2" (with an implicit "Level 0" for projects that have nothing
    produced)
  - Agreed that *entrance* criteria into "Level 1" is at least a Beta
    "release".
  - Postponed discussion on the *entrance* criteria to "Level 2" until
    post-SoC launch
  - Left open the possibility of a "Level 3" for projects that the GPC
    can use to strategically steer focus/spotlight for OWASP Projects.
  - Next meeting should focus on the *exit* criteria for SoC. Note that
    because SOC falls under both the OWASP Projects governance and the
    OWASP Grant framework, the *exit* criteria for SOC does not have to
    be strictly based on the project criteria being established.

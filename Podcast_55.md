## Topics

This podcast is based on the blog post "Overcoming Objections to an
Application Security Program" by Jeremiah Grossman at
<http://jeremiahgrossman.blogspot.com/2009/08/overcoming-objections-to-application.html>

  - "There have been no security problems in the past, nor is there any
    evidence we’ll be attacked in the future."
  - "Security is an IT problem. They have firewalls, patch &
    configuration management systems, and SSL currently in place
    protecting us."
  - "We need new features first and there is no discretionary budget
    left to allocate towards security."
  - "Hackers can't break in because our Web application can't be
    accessed externally."
  - "We outsource our software development and the vendor is responsible
    for making sure the code is secure."
  - "We use penetration-testing services. We fix or accept the risk of
    any issues found, which keeps us safe."
  - "We passed our most recent compliance audit and not required to do
    anything more."
  - "We trust our developers and they already know how to develop secure
    code after completing the training course."
  - "We already have scanning tools. Doing more will slow down the
    development process, inhibit innovation, and add large unnecessary
    costs."

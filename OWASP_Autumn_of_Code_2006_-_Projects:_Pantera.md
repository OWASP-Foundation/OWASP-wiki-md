We are happy we have completed our AOC sponsorship and we will like to
thanks OWASP for their support\!\! However there is a long road ahead of
us and we need to keep the hard work with your help :)

Thanks to OWASP help we have improved quite a lot Pantera:

  - Better performanced
  - More PPA scanning plugins
  - New features like Import / Export data
  - Tons of bug fixes :)
  - and much more we will let you explore\!

But keep in mind we are not going to stop here, we plan to continue with
the development and support of Pantera :)

## Background and Motivation

**History Behind Project**

Pantera was developed out of necessity, to create an easy but powerful
application assessment framework. The development of Pantera started at
some point in 2005 using SpikeProxy as baseline. Since then it has
changed a lot by adding many cool features. Simon Roses Femerling, main
developer, donated Pantera to OWASP in August 2006.

**Problem to be Addressed**

Where to start\!\! Even Pantera have been successfully used in several
assessments it is far from finished. This project needs a lot of work
and support from the community as it is currently being developed by
just one person. Several design issues have been identified and will be
addressed in future versions

**Benefit to OWASP Members and Community**

The benefit of Pantera is to provide a top-notch open source solution to
perform professional application assessments.

## Goals and Deliverables

**Plan of Approach**

Check out Pantera Progress Page

**Deliverables**

As described in OWASP AOC the deliverables are:

  - Mature and robust framework: The purpose of Pantera is to come up
    with a mature framework to perform application assessments where
    performance, portability and usability are key elements in the
    design.
  - Active Scanning Engine via a plug-in system: A complete
    vulnerability scanning engine in 3 phases (recon/spider,
    vulnerabilities, verify result)
  - Automated Analysis Tools (Auth brute force, decompiler, etc.):
    Automated tools to perform repetitive tasks like authorization brute
    force, fuzzing, etc.
  - Import data from well-known sources as Application Scanners and
    other Pentesting Proxies: Import all data into Pantera to replay
    attacks and/or correlate findings to obtain the best results
    possible.
  - Charts and pie generation of analyzed data: Visual charts and pies
    to get a better picture of the vulnerabilities and obtained data
    from the assessment.
  - Report generation with customization in different formats (HTML,
    XML, PDF, etc.): Generate report in different formats and able to
    customize to your taste.
  - Improved Data Mining capabilities: Better data mining analysis.
  - Assessment Timeframe: Create a timeframe of the assessment.

## Risks and Rewards

**Main Risks**

  - Not being able to complete the project in time.
  - Monumental task for just one person.

**Rewards of Successful Project**

  - Create a useful and professional project.
  - Contributing to OWASP and the community

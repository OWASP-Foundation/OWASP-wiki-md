For those not familiar, Core Impact is a penetration testing toolkit and
framework, often compared to Metasploit. Recent features of Core Impact
called WebVerify now address web security weaknesses and flaws. The

will be available to answer quetsions about the network and other
non-web-focused features in Core Impact after their talk.

# Agenda

Meeting started 2100 GMT

  - Determine exit criteria for SoC
  - Determine "core criteria" for projects (assessment frame)
  - Determine nomenclature for L0/L1/L2 for projects and L1/L2/L3 for
    releases
  - Discuss entrance criteria to L2 for projects (if time permits)
      - Present "Project Health" proposal:
          - Define project "health" characteristics (e.g., frequency of
            releases, adoption rate, etc)
          - Entrance criteria into L2 is 50% of the "health"
            characteristics
          - Entrance criteria into L3 is 100% of the "health"
            characteristics (or board/GPC discretion?)
          - In general, projects will not backslide from L2 to L1 or L1
            to L0; projects *will* move in and out of L3
  - Discuss entrance criteria for "archived" projects (if time permits)

Meeting ended 2130 GMT

# Minutes

  - Agreed on Project Health Proposal
  - Agreed on Alpha, Beta, Stable designations for releases
  - Agreed that we should impose a naming convention for releases to
    prevent confusion between version numbers and assessment criteria
    rating (e.g., v1.203-beta for an Alpha quality release)
  - Agreed that "Level X" servers as appropriate nomenclature for
    Project Health
  - Agreed that projects can backslide from Level 2 to Level 1

# Action Items

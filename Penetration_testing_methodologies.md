## Summary

  - OWASP testing guide
  - PCI Penetration testing guide
  - Penetration Testing Execution Standard
  - NIST 800-115
  - Penetration Testing Framework
  - Information Systems Security Assessment Framework (ISSAF)
  - Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (“OSSTMM”)
  - FedRAMP Penetration Test Guidance
  - CREST Penetration Testing Guide

## Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES)

PTES defines penetration testing as 7 phases.

  - Pre-engagement Interactions
  - Intelligence Gathering
  - Threat Modeling
  - Vulnerability Analysis
  - Exploitation
  - Post Exploitation
  - Reporting

Instead of simply methodology or process, PTES also provides hands-on
technical guidelines for what/how to test, the rationale of testing and
recommended testing tools and usage.

## PCI Penetration testing guide

Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) Requirement 11.3
defines the penetration testing. PCI also defines Penetration Testing
Guidance.

### PCI DSS Penetration Testing guidance

The PCI DSS Penetration testing guideline provides a very good reference
of the following area while it's not a hands-on technical guideline to
introduce testing tools.

  - Penetration Testing Components
  - Qualifications of a Penetration Tester
  - Penetration Testing Methodologies
  - Penetration Testing Reporting Guidelines

### PCI DSS Penetration Testing Requirements

The PCI DSS requirement refer to Payment Card Industry Data Security
Standard (PCI DSS) Requirement 11.3

  - Based on industry-accepted approaches
  - Coverage for CDE and critical systems
  - Includes external and internal testing
  - Test to validate scope reduction
  - Application-layer testing
  - Network-layer tests for network and OS

## Penetration Testing Framework

The Penetration testing framework provides very comprehensive hands-on
penetration testing guide. It also list usage of the testing tools in
each testing category. The major area of penetration testing includes -

  - Network Footprinting (Reconnaissance)
  - Discovery & Probing
  - Enumeration
  - Password cracking
  - Vulnerability Assessment
  - AS/400 Auditing
  - Bluetooth Specific Testing
  - Cisco Specific Testing
  - Citrix Specific Testing
  - Network Backbone
  - Server Specific Tests
  - VoIP Security
  - Wireless Penetration
  - Physical Security
  - Final Report - template

## Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment (NIST800-115)

## Information Systems Security Assessment Framework (ISSAF)

The ISSAF is a very good reference source of penetration testing though
Information Systems Security Assessment Framework (ISSAF) which is not
an active community. It provides comprehensive step-by-step penetration
testing technical guidance.

The ISSAF penetration testing guide can be downloaded here.
<https://sourceforge.net/projects/isstf/>

It covers the area below.

  - Project Management
  - Guidelines And Best Practices – Pre Assessment, Assessment And Post
    Assessment
  - Assessment Methodology
  - Review Of Information Security Policy And Security Organization
  - Evaluation Of Risk Assessment Methodology
  - Technical Control Assessment
  - Technical Control Assessment - Methodology
  - Password Security
  - Password Cracking Strategies
  - Unix /Linux System Security Assessment
  - Windows System Security Assessment
  - Novell Netware Security Assessment
  - Database Security Assessment
  - Wireless Security Assessment
  - Switch Security Assessment
  - Router Security Assessment
  - Firewall Security Assessment
  - Intrusion Detection System Security Assessment
  - VPN Security Assessment

## Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM)

OSSTMM is a methodology to test the operational security of physical
locations, workflow, human security testing, physical security testing,
wireless security testing, telecommunication security testing, data
networks security testing and compliance. OSSTMM can be supporting
reference of IOS 27001 instead of a hands-on penetration testing guide.

OSSTMM includes the following key sections:

  -   - Operational Security Metrics
      - Trust Analysis
      - Work Flow.
      - Human Security Testing
      - Physical Security Testing
      - Wireless Security Testing
      - Telecommunications Security Testing
      - Data Networks Security Testing
      - Compliance Regulations
      - Reporting with the STAR (Security Test Audit Report)

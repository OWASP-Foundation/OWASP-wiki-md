## Participants

  - <b>Mike Bailey</b> is an Application Security Specialist and
    researcher who has been looking into CSRF, XSS, and other
    underappreciated security bugs in web applications. As the
    Information Security Officer for a web development firm, much of his
    time goes into educating developers and project managers on secure
    application development. He has disclosed critical bugs in many
    popular web applications, from cPanel's Web Hosting Manager to
    Facebook. Mike is better at breaking things than fixing them, and
    has been described as "a good guy, with an evil mind."

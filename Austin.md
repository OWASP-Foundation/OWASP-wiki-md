# Study Groups

## Our Study Groups

![OWASP_Austin_Study_Group_sm.png](OWASP_Austin_Study_Group_sm.png
"OWASP_Austin_Study_Group_sm.png") The **OWASP Austin Study Group** is
intended to provide an organized gathering of like-minded IT
professionals who want to learn more about application security. This is
done through mini-discussions, demos, presentations, and series of
meetings to cover more involved topics (i.e. book topics). Generally the
topics will be participant-led, meaning that attendees will volunteer
their time to present or lead a discussion, whether a one-time
presentation of a topic they wish to review or need help with, or walk
through topics of a particular chapter of a book being covered. There
will still be OWASP leadership involved with scheduling and such, but
the idea is to get a better “hands-on” approach to create a more
productive learning environment. We learn more when we are involved.

**Where:** National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C

**Title:** Angular for AppSec Professionals

> One of the most popular web frameworks is Angular. While you don't
> need to become an expert in new JavaScript frameworks to be able to
> conduct successful assessments of Angular applications, knowing the
> fundamentals and building blocks of that framework can definitely give
> you an advantage during the initial phases of an application security
> assessment. This talk aims to introduce application security
> professionals to the basics of AngularJS and Angular applications from
> a security standpoint. We will also demonstrate how to dynamically
> debug Angular code from the browser console. This allows us to change
> the behavior on an application by manipulating Angular components.
> With that knowledge in hand, we can start conducting a more in-depth
> analysis of Angular based applications.

**Speaker:** Alex Useche

> Alex is an Application Security Consultant at nVisium and has over 12
> years of experience in the IT industry as a software developer,
> security engineer, and penetration tester. As a software developer, he

> range of languages and frameworks, including Angular, .NET and Django.
> While his expertise is in application security, Alex also has
> experience conducting penetration tests of internal and external
> networks. In his previous position, Alex led several projects aimed at
> building secure coding and DevOps processes for a mid-sized
> consultancy agency, as well as automating security analysis tasks.
> Alex has a Bachelors in Information Technology and a Masters in

### OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting, September 25, 2018

**When:** Tuesday, September 25th @ 11:45 AM - 1:00 PM

**Where:** National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C

**Title:** Scaling Your Cyber Security Threat Modeling

> There are two schools of thought around threat modeling. One school
> advocates the creation of attack trees and data flow diagrams. This
> requires extensive, cross-functional, security skills and is not a
> scalable approach. The other school encourages organic insertion of
> defenses based only on current context without “boiling the ocean”.
> This lack of systems thinking leaves applications vulnerable as
> exploits in a weaker component can open the door to critical systems.
>
> Part of the problem is threat modeling today is largely an art. We
> need to inject more science in this domain and derive a repeatable and
> auditable approach that maps to risk. Such a model should abstract
> away the non-scalable elements and still provide a high degree of
> assurance in today’s faster velocity business context.
>
> This presentation will outline a threat modeling framework that
> abstracts traditional methods into systems, data, and people
> components. You will come away with an approach that takes away some
> of the scalability problems of traditional threat modeling, yet
> provides sufficient rigor and systems thinking to help manage risk.

**Speaker:** Pranoy De - Software Engineer

> Pranoy currently works as a backend developer at Security Compass,
> helping to develop industry-leading application security products.
> Over the years, Pranoy has taken on a variety of roles, which included
> working as a software consultant, working as a network engineer, and
> writing software for the VFX industry.
>
> As a network engineer, Pranoy has primarily spent his time developing
> and conducting planned DDoS attacks for companies testing their
> defenses. This was his first position in the world of cybersecurity,
> and it eventually lead to his current role in application security.

**When:** Tuesday, February 27th @ 11:45 AM - 1:00 PM

**Where:** National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C

**Title:** DevSecOps Unplugged (Results from our latest research on
DevSecOps)

> There is a confluence of forces that disrupt the ability for
> organizations to implement DevSecOps effectively. We continue to
> increase our dependence on software but teams are still relatively
> immature in developing securely. Our systems continue to grow
> exponentially complex. With IoT starting to take off, there is no
> clear industry vision for security these devices. Cybersecurity
> threats continue to rise. Even the most diligent teams find themselves
> subtly gaining technical debt because they are unable to do the job
> right.
>
> This impact is felt across industries: telecommunications, financial,
> software development, transportation, and medical just to name a few.
> So what is our response as security professionals? We have software
> tools and databases like OWASP Top 10, CWE/CVE, SANS Top 25 and so on.
> But what we need is a set of patterns and anti-patterns on
> implementing DevSecOps.
>
> Our talk will highlight what we’ve observed in conducting research
> from Tier 1 peer reviewed articles from 2016 to the present. We will
> present what seems to be emerging as a set of best practices as well
> as anti-patterns in DevSecOps.

**Where:** National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C

**Title:** Privacy-Preserving Authentication, Another Reason to Care
about Zero-Knowledge Proofs

> You can ignore the Blockchain hype for identity solutions, it is
> superb marketing; but suboptimal technology. You can also ignore
> biometrics for a spell. Instead, the real breakthroughs, especially in
> authentication, will be based on elegant math and crypto, e.g.,
> Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP). These have the added benefit of being
> privacy-preserving, and amenable to user control of identity
> attributes. ZKP has been identified as a category for many other
> solutions in the future, not just identity. Conceived at MIT in 1985
> by Shafi Goldwasser, ZKP is still young. You will see it in many other
> contexts as appreciation and recognition evolves.

**Speaker:** Clare Nelson, CISSP, CIPP/E

> Clare's focus combines security, privacy, and identity. Her middle
> name is MFA, and she loves all things identity. She forges identity
> solution roadmaps and tracks emerging technologies, especially in
> light of EU regulations including GDPR and PSD2.

> Clare’s early technical background includes software development of
> encrypted TCP/IP variants for NSA. She has held leadership positions
> in product management, marketing, and technology for companies
> including EMC2, Dell, Novell, and TeaLeaf Technology (IBM).

> Clare is a co-founder of the mentoring organization, C1ph3r_Qu33ns.
> She headed ClearMark Consulting for 14 years, and she is currently
> Director, Office of the CTO at AllClear ID. She has a B.S. in
> Mathematics from Tufts University, and is a lifelong fitness

**Title:** Frontline Web App Security

> According to the Verizon DBIR (Data Breach Investigation Report) for
> 2016, web application attacks are the \#1 source of data breaches. Web
> applications account for only 8 percent of overall reported incidents.
> However, attacks on web applications accounted for over 40 percent of
> incidents resulting in a data breach, and were the single-biggest
> source of data loss.

> With those threats in mind, it has never been more important to ensure
> that companies have visibility into what is happening with their web
> apps. The most effective way to address application flaws and
> preemptively block unknown attacks is to have a close relationship
> with your web application firewall.

> Static, signature based blocking is not enough to address never before
> seen attacks. In this talk, we will walk through scenarios that we
> have observed, talk about coding practices that enable your web app to
> be secured, and describe the steps that are taken to defend against
> critical web applications attacks.

**Speakers:** Paul Scott and Jason Payne

> Paul Scott is an OWASP Houston chapter leader and the Manager of Alert
> Logic’s Web Application Security Team. Jason Payne ran the Alert Logic
> Global Security Operations Center for nearly a decade and is now
> engineering solutions to defend systems, networks, and application on
> premises and in the cloud.

**Title:** DevSecOps Lessons from Detroit to Deming

> In 1982, the city of Detroit saw 15,000 vehicles roll off its
> production lines every day. To achieve this goal, Detroit's line
> workers were being measured on velocity, often at the expense of
> quality. At the same time, auto workers in Japan -- applying lessons
> from W. Edwards Deming -- were implementing new supply chain
> management practices which enabled them to manufacture higher quality
> vehicles, for less cost, at higher velocity. As a result, from 1962 to
> 1982, the Detroit auto industry lost 20% of its domestic market to
> Japan.
>
> The parallels between the auto industry of 35 years ago and software
> development practices in place today are remarkable. DevOps teams
> around the world are consuming billions of open source components and
> containerized applications to improve productivity at a massive scale.
> The good news: they are accelerating time to market. The bad news:
> many of the components and containers they are using are fraught with
> defects including critical security vulnerabilities.
>
> This session aimed to enlighten Security, DevOps, and development
> professionals by sharing results from the 2017 State of the Software
> Supply Chain Report -- a blend of public and proprietary data with
> expert research and analysis. The presentation also revealed findings
> from the 2017 DevSecOps Community survey where over 2,200
> professionals shared their experiences blending DevOps and security
> practices together. Throughout the discussion, Derek shared lessons
> that Deming employed decades ago to help us accelerate adoption of the
> right DevSecOps culture, practices, and measures today.

**Speaker:** Derek E. Weeks

> After flying to 40 countries and racing through a half-Ironman
> competition, Derek woke up one morning on the top of Kilimanjaro and
> saw the world in a new light. Soon after, Derek become a huge advocate
> of applying proven supply chain management principles into AppSec
> practices to improve efficiencies and sustain long-lasting competitive
> advantages. He currently serves as vice president and DevSecOps
> advocate at Sonatype, creators of the Nexus repository manager and the
> global leader in solutions for software supply chain automation.
>  Derek is also the co-founder of the All Day DevOps conference and
> the lead researcher behind the annual State of the Software Supply
> Chain report.

**Title:** The ABCs of Source-Assisted Web Application Penetration
Testing With OWASP ZAP: Attack Surface, Backdoors, and Configuration

> There are a number of reasons to use source code to assist in web
> application penetration testing such as making better use of
> penetration testers’ time, providing penetration testers with deeper
> insight into system behavior, and highlighting specific sections of so
> development teams can remediate vulnerabilities faster. Examples of
> these are provided using the open source ThreadFix plugin for the
> OWASP ZAP proxy and dynamic application security testing tool. These
> show opportunities attendees have to enhance their own penetration
> tests given access to source code.
>
> This presentation covers the “ABCs” of source code assisted web
> application penetration testing: covering issues of attack surface
> enumeration, backdoor identification, and configuration issue
> discovery. Having access to the source lets an attacker enumerate all
> of the URLs and parameters an application exposes – essentially its
> attack surface. Knowing these allows pen testers greater application
> coverage during testing. In addition, access to source code can help
> to identify potential backdoors that have been intentionally added to
> the system. Comparing the results of blind spidering to a full attack
> surface model can identify items of interest such as hidden admin
> consoles or secret backdoor parameters. Finally, the presentation
> examines how access to source code can help identify configuration
> settings that may have an adverse impact on the security of the
> deployed application.

**Where:** National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C

**Title:** Lean Security

> Moving fast is a business imperative that you can’t afford to be in
> opposition to. Lean, DevOps and Continuous Delivery philosophies hinge
> on the ability to move fast through collaboration, automation, and
> aligning with the flow of the organization. Security needs to be able
> to make the same transformation.
>
> As a concrete example of applying these approaches to security, we
> will show how a platform automation approach to security increases
> transparency and visibility throughout the organization and pairs with
> the high-throughput philosophies of DevOps and Continuous Delivery,
> while working with the way the business functions and not against it.
>
> From this session, you will:
>
>   - Understand the Lean, Agile, and DevOps techniques emerging in
>     organizations today
>   - Be armed with organizational strategies for bridging devops and
>     security
>   - Apply Lean thinking to security operations.

**When:** Tuesday, February 23rd @ 11:45 - 1PM

**Where:** National Instruments, 11500 N. Mopac.Building C

**Title:** Rugged DevOps Using Gauntlt

Writing code that works is hard. Writing rugged code that can stand the
test of time is even harder. This difficulty is often compounded by
crunched timelines and fast cycles that prioritize new features. Add in
evolving business needs and new technology and it becomes confusing to
know what to do and how to integrate security into your application.

This workshop brings in some of the top developers and application
security practitioners to help you ruggedize your end-to-end development
lifecycle from code commit to running system.

Three Takeaways: 

1.  You will learn pragmatic approaches and tooling that will affect
    your development processes and delivery pipelines.
2.  Armed with tools and ideas for monitoring your operational and
    runtime security.
3.  You will walk away with code examples and tools that you can put
    into practice right away for security and rugged testing.

Bring a laptop (mac or linux) that you can install software on and a
github account.

### OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting, September 29th

**When:** Tuesday, September 29th @ 11:45 - 1PM

**Title:** Log Everything, even if it is just on local disks

Logs are as important as SQLi, XSS or Secure Coding\! OWASP has a
“Logging Cheat Sheet”, and there are the “Windows Logging Cheat
Sheet”, “Windows PowerShell Logging Cheat Sheet”, “Windows Splunk
Logging Cheat Sheet” and several other I created, but we still lack an
understanding of logging when it comes to Application Security and
DevOps.

Enabling and configuration of logs must become as basic and a standard
practice as doing WebApp security scans, secure code reviews or secure
webapp design, which should include application log design and
implementation. You don’t need an expensive log management solution to
do good application security or DevOps log configuration. What we need
is to include all our Cheat Sheets into DevOps builds so enabling and
configuration is baked in and to include a log design review as a part
of our application secure reviews. So WHEN we need log data, it is there
for us.

**Speaker:** Michael Gough

### OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting, August 25th

**Title:** Eat Your Own Dogfood

As security professionals, we have made it our jobs to tell other people
how to be secure. We preach security in everything from applications to
systems to networks and more. We get more and more frustrated with each
and every issue that we find and sometimes even angry when others aren't
fixing things fast enough. But, with all of the berating that we do of
others for their security downfalls, how many of us actually put in the
time and effort to do things right ourselves? And what happens when
those people who we are trying to teach see us not practicing what we
preach? Security begins and ends with you. It's time to start eating
your own dogfood.

**Speaker:** Josh Sokol

### OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting, July 28th

**Title:** The EMV Card Standard - What is it and How Does it Work?

Europay MasterCard Visa (EMV) is a global standard by introducing a
microprocessor chip into all debit and credit cards. This chip which
will eventually replace the current magnetic strip on the back of credit
cards as a means of mitigating credit card fraud. All U.S. merchants
will be required to support EMV by October, 2015.

This new standard has been in use in Europe and Asia for many years and
has proven to be an improvement over the mag stripe. However, there are
new risks associated with the chip and the debate of the proper
implementation of this new standard (e.g. the advantage over
“chip-and-pin” vs. “chip-and-signature”) will continue for some time.

What is this new technology and how will it be used in transactions? The
physical and logical security characteristics of this new standard will
be presented, new risks will be addressed and security recommendations
will be given.

### OWASP Austin Chapter Meeting, June 30th

**When:** Tuesday, June 30th @ 11:45 - 1PM

**Title:** Authz is the new Authn: Trust Elevation with UMA and OpenID
Connect

Increased trust in an online identity = increased mitigation of the risk
of fraud. As an enterprise interacts with a person via the Internet, it
may be prudent, for certain transactions, to have more evidence of that
person’s identity. Web Access Management systems include some
proprietary features to force “stepped-up authentication.” But luckily,
new OAuth2 profiles like UMA and OpenID Connect offer a standards based
approach to achieve inter-domain trust elevation. This session will
include a high level overview of the Enterprise UMA use case and some of
the useful OpenID Connect features that can be leveraged to create
centralized authentication policies.

**Speaker:** Mike Schwartz

Mike has been an entrepreneur and identity specialist for over 18 years.
He is the technical and business visionary behind Gluu, whose open
source OX projects enable domains to centralize authentication and
authorization using open standards like SAML and OAuth2. Mike is a

### OWASP Austin March Chapter Meeting - April 28th

**Title:** Using OpenSAMM for Benchmarking and Software Security
Improvement

We all know that behind every breach story in the press is an
organization that probably should have done more to build secure
software. Yet, organizations struggle mightily to focus resources on
building software securely from the outset and, as a result, software
security remains an after the fact “nice to do” and not a “have to do”
activity in many organizations. How can organizations determine the
right sets of activities or appropriate resource allocation levels that
it should undertake to adequately address software risk? Organizations
can make these determinations by benchmarking via OWASP’s Open Software
Assurance Maturity Model (OpenSAMM) framework.

A coalition of leading application security industry vendors recently
contributed benchmarking data in order to enhance OpenSAMM and its
assessment framework. These efforts will enable organizations to step up
their software security game and identify hurdles by using OpenSAMM as a
powerful benchmarking tool. John will provide details on an ongoing
industry effort to improve OpenSAMM by providing more comparative data
to encourage broader use throughout industry.

### OWASP Austin January Chapter Meeting - January 27th

**Title:** CryptoParty\!\!\!\!\!\!

**Abstract:** In 1996, John Perry Barlow, co-founder of the Electronic
Frontier Foundation (EFF) wrote 'A Declaration of the Independence of
Cyberspace' where he stated "We are creating a world that all may enter
without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power,
military force, or station of birth. We are creating a world where
anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular,
without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity." The Internet
of today is an amazing place of knowledge and opportunity, but it
unfortunately falls short of Mr. Barlow's original vision.

In the 21st century we face problems of climate change, energy crisis,
state censorship, mass surveillance, and on-going wars. We must be free
to to communicate and associate without fear. To realize our right to
privacy and anonymity online, we need peer-reviewed, crowd-sourced
solutions. CryptoParties provide the opportunity to meet up and learn
how to use these solutions to give us all the means with which to assert
our right to privacy and anonymity online. Topics include technologies
like TOR, full-disk encryption, GPG, and many more. CryptoParties are
free to attend, public, and not commercially aligned.

At our January 27, 2015 OWASP Austin meeting, we will host our first
ever CryptoParty with the goal of inviting others to join us in learning
about the tools and technologies that enable an individual's right to
privacy. We encourage you all to invite your family, friends, and peers
to attend this event. Presentations will be laid out so that novice and
experienced alike can take action based on the data presented. All tools
presented will be free and open source. Our CryptoParty will end with
the first-ever OWASP Austin Key Signing Party. Don't miss this meeting
and be sure to invite your friends\!

### OWASP Austin September Chapter Meeting - September 30th

**When:** September 30th, 11:30AM to 1PM

**Title:** Account Entrapment

**Abstract:** This talk covers two ways to force a victim into an
attacker's account (Account Entrapment): Login Cross-Site Request
Forgery and Cookie-based or Session Entrapment. This is a commonly
overlooked vulnerability despite high-profile exploits including
Youtube.com. Because it is often disregarded, this talk begins with an
in-depth look at attack scenarios and what an attacker can actually
gain. It then describes how the two attacks work and how to defend
against them. Finally, though these attacks are prevalent across the
internet, it will show why state agencies (with domains ending in
.state.\*\*.us) and large organizations with many subdomains face
special problems when building defenses against these attacks.

**Speaker:** Ben Broussard

**About:** Ben Broussard has been involved in the Austin Appsec scene
since 2008, helping to plan the first LASCON and running the OWASP study
group for a time. After doing subcontracting work for a number of
security shops and gaining a breadth of experience on both the
threatscape and the security organizations that attempt to address it,
he took a position with San Antonio based Denim Group (now with an
Austin office). When not researching appsec, Ben is a hobbyist in Human
Physiology, Acrobatics, Human Evolution, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, and
toddler wrangling. He also runs Hot Lava Obstacle Course located on

### OWASP Austin August Chapter Meeting - August 26th

**When:** August 26th, 11:30AM to 1PM

**Title:** Identifying Web Attacks via Data Analysis

**Abstract:** This presentation will look at detection of SQL injection
using Machine Learning as well as profiling web traffic to find
misbehaving hosts. The goal is to get beyond "Top N" types of analysis
and begin using multiple features to guide us towards interesting
traffic. With these techniques multiple log types can be used,
everything from web server logs to proxy logs.

**Speaker:** Mike Sconzo

### OWASP Austin March Chapter Meeting - June 24th

**When:** June 24th, 11:30AM to 1PM

**Title:** Integrating process and architecture to yield robust systems

**Abstract:** When producing software products that meet the objectives
of both the business unit and the security shop, the developers best
friend is process and a secure architecture. Robust systems require a
holistic view of security where attribution, reliability and
confidentiality do not put a strain on the dev shop, but provide an
environment that optimizes the use of infrastructure and standards to
yield secure and robust systems. How do we do that and meet the budget
and time constraints that we all face?

### OWASP Austin February Chapter Meeting - February 25th

**Title:** Magical Code Injection Rainbow

**Abstract:** There are many intentionally vulnerable web applications
available for people to learn how to exploit various types of flaws.
Unfortunately, many of them have only the most basic and easily
exploited examples of flaws. In order to work with a more complex
version of a flaw, it's usually necessary to write your own vulnerable
application or modify an existing one. There is another option\! The
Magical Code Injection Rainbow\! MCIR is a framework for building
configurable vulnerable applications. This presentation will demonstrate
the use of the existing MCIR applications such as SQLol (for SQL
injection) and XMLmao (for XML and XPath injection), teach advanced
exploitation techniques in SQL injection; XPath injection; cross-site
scripting; and shell command injection, discuss the exploitation of
insecure cryptosystems and discuss how to use the MCIR framework to
build your own configurable vulnerable application.

**Speaker:** Daniel Crowley(aka "unicornFurnace") is a Senior Security
Consultant for Trustwave's SpiderLabs team. Daniel denies all
allegations regarding unicorn smuggling and questions your character for
even suggesting it. Daniel has developed configurable testbeds such as
SQLol and XMLmao for training and research regarding specific
vulnerabilities. Daniel enjoys climbing large rocks. Daniel has been
working in the information security industry since 2004 and is a
frequent speaker at conferences including Black Hat, DEF CON, Shmoocon,

'''Topic: ''' Anatomy of Advanced Email Attacks (Aaron Estes, Cigital)

Abstract: Email attacks comprise an overwhelming majority of the daily
attacks on modern enterprise. The leading mitigation strategy is a
combination of user awareness training and email filtering. This talk
outlines a proposed solution that brings email risk and awareness
information down to the client level in order to better equip end users
in making secure decisions when using email.

Anti-spam capabilities have been incorporated into email client
applications for some time now. These are usually in the form of junk
boxes or email filters that attempt to identify spam or other unwanted
email. Most anti-spam clients use bayesian filtering to determine
whether an email is spam or not spam, typically using word combinations
and statistical analysis to make a determination. Many experts also
advise wary email users to examine the raw email headers in order to
attempt to find evidence of an email attack. While this is not bad
advise, it is however a highly technical process and one cannot expect
the majority of email users to be able to carry out and act upon this
advice. This is the problem that the proposed Advanced Email Risk
Classification and Recipient Decision Assistance solution attempts to
solve. The operating name for this solution is Phish Finder.

'''Who: ''' Aaron Estes, Cigital

'''Topic: ''' Anatomy of Advanced Email Attacks (Aaron Estes, Cigital)

Abstract: Email attacks comprise an overwhelming majority of the daily
attacks on modern enterprise. The leading mitigation strategy is a
combination of user awareness training and email filtering. This talk
outlines a proposed solution that brings email risk and awareness
information down to the client level in order to better equip end users
in making secure decisions when using email.

Anti-spam capabilities have been incorporated into email client
applications for some time now. These are usually in the form of junk
boxes or email filters that attempt to identify spam or other unwanted
email. Most anti-spam clients use bayesian filtering to determine
whether an email is spam or not spam, typically using word combinations
and statistical analysis to make a determination. Many experts also
advise wary email users to examine the raw email headers in order to
attempt to find evidence of an email attack. While this is not bad
advise, it is however a highly technical process and one cannot expect
the majority of email users to be able to carry out and act upon this
advice. This is the problem that the proposed Advanced Email Risk
Classification and Recipient Decision Assistance solution attempts to
solve. The operating name for this solution is Phish Finder.

**Topic: Half-Day Threat Modeling Seminar with John Steven of Cigital**

How will attackers break your web application? How much security testing
is enough? Do I have to worry about insiders? Threat modeling, applied
with a risk management approach can answer both of these questions if
done correctly. This talk will present advanced threat modeling
step-wise through examples and exercises using the Java EE platform and
focusing on authentication, authorization, and session management.

Participants will learn, through interactive exercise on real software
architectures, how to use diagramming techniques to explicitly document
threats their applications face, identify how assets worth protecting
manifest themselves within the system, and enumerate the attack vectors
these threats take advantage of. Participants will then engage in secure
design activities, learning how to use the threat model to specify
compensating controls for specified attack vectors. Finally, we'll
discuss how the model can drive security testing and validate an
application resists specified attack.

'''Topic: ''' STAAF: A FLOSS Framework for Scalable and Sharable Android
App Analysis

With no end of Android malware anywhere in sight, it’s no wonder that so
many Android analysis tools have been released lately. While each of
these powerful tools makes great strides in finding artifacts in an
individual application, they’re typically not designed to scale beyond a
few thousand selected samples at most. In order to effective insight
into android applications researchers need to be be able to analyze a
substantial subset of the 300k+ applications in the official store, all
of the applications across the disparate unofficial Android stores and
repositories, as well as ad-hoc manually-submitted applications. This
was the motivation for STAAF, a Scalable Tailored Application Analysis
Framework. STAAF was designed to allow an analyst to easily
add/remove/configure various analysis modules, then process large
numbers of applications at once or over time, then share the raw data,
processed data, and results with other organizations. In this
presentation I’ll cover the STAAF Architecture, the current status and
available implementation, and if circumstances permit, show a quick demo
with a handful of applications.

**Who:** Ryan Smith (Praetorian)

'''Topic: ''' Protecting Your Applications from Backdoors: How to Secure
Your Business Critical Applications from Time Bombs, Backdoors & Data
Exfiltration

With the increasing practice of outsourcing and using 3rd party
libraries, it is nearly impossible for an enterprise to identify the
pedigree and security of the software running its business critical
applications. As a result backdoors and malicious code are increasingly
becoming the prevalent attack vector used by hackers. Whether you manage
internal development activities, work with third party developers or are
developing a COTS application for enterprise, your mandate is clear-
safeguard your code and make applications security a priority for
internal and external development teams.

In this session we will cover:

  - Prevalence of backdoors and malicious code in third party attacks

<!-- end list -->

  - Definitions and classifications of backdoors and their impact on
    your applications

<!-- end list -->

  - Methods to identify, track and remediate these vulnerabilities

years now, he has been cracking these passwords, and discovering more
and more patterns that users are using. But the majority of password
cracking tools out there (Such as John the Ripper, L0phtCrack, etc) do
not take advantage of these "human weaknesses" in password creation. So
far Rick has cracked almost 4 million hashes from inside corporate
America, and an additional 5+ million from sources over the Internet.

During this talk Rick will talk about the current state of password
cracking by walking the attendees through a PWDUMP output file
containing 49000+ real "complex" NTLM passwords) how the default
rule-set provided by John the Ripper can be improved to crack tens of
thousands of additional passwords. Wordlists/Dictionaries will be shared
that can help you better crack passwords (these wordlists were created
based on what users are _actually_ doing in Fortune 500 environments).
New "rules" will be given out that were created to specifically attack
the patterns that users are choosing.

This is relevant to OWASP, because the applications we are
developing/securing almost always have logins and passwords that protect
them. But, unlike Operating Systems, our web applications do not usually
have strict password requirements that users have to meet in order to
create an account. We do this as to not scare away users; but we are
placing our OWN systems at risk.

Even now, sites like Google/Twitter/Facebook only warn the users about
poor passwords, or have a list of 500 passwords that are not allowed.
This will _not_ be the case in 10 years. Lets address this problem
now.

The only way to address the problem, is to first become aware of how bad
our users are at choosing passwords , and what we can do (as developers
or security professionals) to help protect our users from themselves.

'''Topic: ''' Application Assessments Reloaded

Trying to integrate Business Software Assurance into Enterprise Risk
Management and Information Security Management programs has had issues
over the years. Penetration-testing was announced dead over a year ago,
but it's still the number one choice of application security
professionals when starting out. Can the activities from
penetration-testing be re-used and turned into something innovative?

Tools (especially application scanners and secure static analysis tools)
have error rates so high, they are useless in the hands of newcomers
(even for peripheral security testing). Some organizations have built
entire applications around or on top of existing appsec tools. Others
are looking to use other kinds of tools, such as
process/methodology/workflow tools, to enhance their classic
penetration-testing tools.

Even the testing/inspection methodologies themselves are outdated and
we're finding that they are challenging or repetitive in many
environments. How do current appsec tools and testing/inspection methods
work in the cloud? If we re-run the same kinds of tests during dev-test,
software quality, and application security cycles, aren't we wasting
valuable time and effort?

This presentation will provide discussion around how to solve many of
these and other challenges in application security. The focus will be on
web applications that use common technologies (HTTP, SQL, Classic
XML/HTML, Javascript, Flash) but also updated to today's standards
(RESTful transactions, NoSQL, HTML5, Ajax/Json, Flex2).

'''Topic: ''' Automated vs. Manual Security: You can't filter The Stupid

Everyone wants to stretch their security budget, and automated
application security tools are an appealing choice for doing so.
However, manual security testing isn’t going anywhere until the HAL
application scanner comes online. This presentation will use often
humorous, real-world examples to illustrate the relative strengths and
weaknesses of automated solutions and manual techniques.


Automated tools have some strengths, namely low incremental cost,
detecting simple vulnerabilities, and performing highly repetitive
tasks. However, automated solutions are far from perfect. There are
entire classes of vulnerabilities that are theoretically impossible for
automated software to detect. Examples include complex information
leakage, race conditions, logic flaws, design flaws, and multistage
process attacks. Beyond that, there are many vulnerabilities that are
too complicated or obscure to practically detect with an automated tool.

'''Topic: ''' Reducing Your Data Security Risk Through Tokenization

The first Austin OWASP meeting of the year is on a really interesting
topic that many of you have probably never thought about: Tokenization.
The concept is simple...use tokens to represent your data instead of
passing around the data itself. For example, why would you give a
customer account representative a full credit card number when all they
need to do their job is the last four digits? Using tokenization, we are
able to reduce the data security risk by limiting the number of systems
that actually store the data. This extremely simplifies audits for
regulations like SOX, HIPAA, and PCI DSS. This presentation will cover
the business drivers for data protection, what tokenization is, and how
to implement it. If your organization has data to protect, then you're
going to want to check out this presentation.

'''Topic: ''' Tracking the progress of an SDL program: lessons from the
gym

Forcing muscle growth is a long process which requires high intensity
weight training and high mental concentration. While the ultimate goal
is often clear, one of the greatest mistakes bodybuilders consistently
make is to overlook the importance of tracking their weight lifting
progress.

Like a successful bodybuilding workout, a security development lifecycle
program must consistently log simple to obtain, yet meaningful metrics
throughout the entire process. Good metrics must lack subjectivity and
clearly aid decision makers to determine areas that need improvement. In
this presentation we’ll discuss metrics used to classify and
appropriately compare security vulnerabilities found in different phases
of the SDL by different teams working in different locations and in
different products. We’ll also discuss how to easily provide decision
makers different views of the same data and verify whether the process

'''Topic: ''' Vulnerability Management In An Application Security World

Identifying application-level vulnerabilities via penetration tests and
code reviews is only the first step in actually addressing the
underlying risk. Managing vulnerabilities for applications is more
challenging than dealing with traditional infrastructure-level
vulnerabilities because they typically require the coordination of
security teams with application development teams and require security
managers to secure time from developers during already-cramped
development and release schedules. In addition, fixes require changes to
custom application code and application-specific business logic rather
than the patches and configuration changes that are often sufficient to
address infrastructure-level vulnerabilities.

This presentation details many of the pitfalls organizations encounter
while trying to manage application-level vulnerabilities as well as
outlines strategies security teams can use for communicating with
development teams. Similarities and differences between security teams’
practice of vulnerability management and development teams’ practice of
defect management will be addressed in order to facilitate healthy
communication between these groups.

'''Topic: ''' Architecting Secure Web Systems

For this month's presentation, we diverge from the typical OWASP topics
of writing secure code, testing to make sure your code is secure, and
other code related topics and delve into the process of actually
architecting a secure web application from the ground up. We'll start
with some basic n-tier architecture (web vs app vs DB), throw in some
firewall and DMZ concepts, then talk about server hardening with client
firewalls (iptables), disabling services, and other techniques. Whether
you're a code monkey wondering how the rest of the world works, a
security guy trying to figure out what you're missing, or an auditor
just trying to understand how the pieces fit together, this presentation
is for you.

'''Topic: ''' Web Application Security in the Airline Industry: Stealing
the Airlines’ Online Data

In this session, attendees will learn about the types of airline data
that is at risk of being stolen by online data thieves. In addition, the
following topics will be further explored:

1\. Important attack scenarios and Web-based vulnerabilities accompanied
by examples of how these attacks can be mitigated by deploying
comprehensive defense solutions;

2\. Protection strategies and tools, such as Web application scanners
and Web application firewalls, which help equalize the gap between the
advanced Web hacker and the security professional; and

3\. Compliance and Software development life cycle approaches.

Following the September 11 attacks, the airline industry recognized its
need to ‘webify’ online ticket reservation systems, crew scheduling, and
passenger profiles in order to enhance operational efficiency. This
ultimately served to decrease the airlines’ operating costs, thereby
increasing their operating profits. However, the following questions
remain: At what costs? What are the information systems and customer
data security risks associated with the airline ‘webification’ process?

Please join in this presentation, which will outline some of the
challenges that members of the airlines industry may face when
attempting to protect their online services. Additionally, attendees
will discover methodologies that airlines may utilize to identify,
assess, and protect against the various risks associated with Web-based
application attacks.

'''Topic: ''' Securely Handling Sensitive Configuration Data.

One of the age old problems with web applications was keeping sensitive
data available on a need to know basis. The classic case of this is
database credentials. The application needs them to connect to the
database but developers shouldn't have direct access to the DB -
particularly the production DB. The presentation will discuss how we
took on this specific problem, our determination that this was a
specific case of a more general problem and how we solved that general
problem. In our solution, sensitive data is only available to the
application and trusted 3rd parties (e.g. DBAs). We will then cover our
implementation of that solution in a .Net 2.0 environment and discuss
some options for J2EE environments. So far, we used our .Net solution
successfully for database credentials and private encryption keys used
in XML-DSig. Sensitive data is only available to the application and
trusted 3rd parties (e.g. DBAs).

'''Topic: '''Web Services Security The concept of web services has
become ubiquitous over the last few years. Frameworks are now available
across many platforms and languages to greatly ease and expedite the
development of web services, often with a vast amount of existing code
reuse. Software companies are taking advantage of this by integrating
this technology into their products giving increased power and
interoperability to their customers. However, the power web services
enables also introduces new risks to an environment. As with web
applications, development has outpaced the understanding and mitigation
of vulnerabilities that arise from this emerging technology. This
presentation will first aim to identify the risks associated with web
services. We will describe the existing security standards and
technologies which target web services (i.e., WS-Security) including its
history, pros and cons, and current status. Finally we will attempt to
extrapolate the future of this space to determine what changes must be
made going forward.

**What:** Security – The Road Less Travelled

Abstract - What do you think Shakespeare had to say about Software
Security? What does an naked motorist have to do with Confidentiality?
What does the Jungle Book character Baloo have to say about Security
Essentials (The Bear Bare Necessities of Life security)? What does the
African Wildlife have to do with Security Concepts? What does pH have to
do with Security? and more … The Road Less Travelled by renowed poet,
Robert Frost ends by with the statement “And that has made all the
difference”. Come to find out the answers to the questions above and see
what it takes to look at Security from a different perspective, that
would make ALL the difference. The session will cover not only the
higher level abstractions of security concepts, but will dive deep
wherever applicable into concepts and code, making it a MUST attend for
Development, QA, PM and Management Staff on both the IT and Business
side. Also, if you are interested in becoming a CISSP® or SSCP®, come

'''Topic: '''Static Analysis Techniques for Testing Application Security

Static Analysis of software refers to examining source code and other
software artifacts without executing them. This presentation looks at
how these techniques can be used to identify security defects in
applications. Approaches examined will range from simple keyword search
methods used to identify calls to banned functions through more
sophisticated data flow analysis used to identify more complicated
issues such as injection flaws. In addition, a demonstration will be
given of two freely-available static analysis tools: FindBugs for the
Java platform and FXCop for the .NET platform. Finally, some approaches
will be presented on how organizations can start using static analysis
tools as part of their development and quality assurance processes.

**Who:** Jeremiah Grossman (WhiteHat Security, CTO, OWASP Founder,
Security Blogger)

**Topic: Business Logic Flaws**

Session handling, credit card transactions, and password recovery are
just a few examples of Web-enabled business logic processes that
malicious hackers have abused to compromise major websites. These types
of vulnerabilities are routinely overlooked during QA because the
process is intended to test what a piece of code is supposed to do and
not what it can be made to do. The other problem(s) with business logic
flaws is scanners can’t identify them, IDS can’t detect them, and Web
application firewalls can’t defend them. Plus, the more sophisticated
and Web 2.0 feature-rich a website, the more prone it is to have flaws
in business logic.

This presentation will provide real-world demonstrations of how
pernicious and dangerous business logic flaws are to the security of a
website. He’ll also show how best to spot them and provide organizations
with a simple and rational game plan to prevent them.

# Sponsorship Opportunities

## Sponsorship Opportunities with our Chapter

The Austin OWASP Chapter can offer your company several sponsorship
opportunities. If you are interested in taking advantage of any of these
opportunities, please contact [Tiana
Chandler](mailto:tiana.chandler@owasp.org), the Austin OWASP Chapter
President.

### Austin Security Professionals Happy Hour Sponsorship

The Austin OWASP Chapter organizes a monthly Austin Security
Professionals Happy Hour event along with the Capitol of Texas ISSA
Chapter. This event has historically drawn around 40 of Austin's finest
security professionals for networking and more. Your sponsorship of this
event includes appetizers and drinks for the attendees. Feel free to
pass out business cards and network just like you would anywhere else.
You'll find no better opportunity to get your name in front of 40+
security professionals for around $500.

### OWASP Meeting Lunch Sponsorship

Our monthly Austin OWASP meetings are held during a person's typical
lunch hours from 11:30 AM to 1:00 PM. For your sponsorship of around
$750 we can arrange food and drinks for up to 60 attendees. In exchange
for your sponsorship, our chapter will provide you with 5 minutes at the
start of the meeting to introduce yourself and tell us about the
products or services that your company offers. You'll also receive
mention of being the lunch sponsor in all e-mail communications about
the meeting.

### OWASP Meeting Presenter Sponsorship

Although OWASP is a non-profit organization, we strive to provide our
members with the best presenters we possibly can. While the Austin area
has tons of security talent, sometimes it's worthwhile to reach beyond
our borders to pull in more awesome presenters. In exchange for covering
travel expenses for these presenters, our chapter will provide you with
5 minutes at the start of the meeting to introduce yourself and tell us
about the products or services that your company offers. You'll also
receive mention of being the presenter sponsor in all e-mail
communications about the meeting.

### Lonestar Application Security Conference (LASCON) Sponsorship

The Lonestar Application Security Conference (LASCON) is an OWASP
conference held annually in Austin, TX. It is a gathering of 400+ web
app developers, security engineers, mobile developers and information
security professionals. LASCON is held in Texas where more Fortune 500
companies call home than any other state and it is held in Austin which
is a hub for startups in the state of Texas. At LASCON, leaders at these
companies along with security architects and developers gather to share
cutting-edge ideas, initiatives, and technology advancements.

Being a non-profit organization, we rely mostly on sponsorships to help
us provide the funding to make LASCON successful.

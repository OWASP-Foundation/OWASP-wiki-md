## Trainings

### WebGoat - Teaching application security 101 by Nanne Baars

#### Topic(s)

  - Web Application Breaker
  - Other

#### Keywords

WebGoat application, security teaching secure development

#### Abstract

A good defense against insecure code requires understanding the
mechanics behind how attackers exploit simple programming mistakes. The
WebGoat team will walk through exercises like SQL Injection, XSS, XXE,
CSRF, ... and demonstrate how these exploits work.

We will show you how you can use WebGoat to train your developers to
avoid these simple but common programming mistakes.

We also show you how to extend WebGoat to create lessons specific to
your environment. Join us to learn the most basic, but common,
application security problems.

Tired of all the lessons? During the training we will host a small CTF
competition which you can take a shot at and compete with each other...

### Requirements

Please find the course prerequisites here:
<https://github.com/nbaars/owasp-training>

#### Bio

Nanne Baars works as a security consultant & developer at JDriven and is
one of the primary developers of WebGoat.

### Whiteboard Hacking aka Hands-on Threat Modeling by Sebastien Deleersnyder

#### Topic(s)

  - Threat modeling introduction
  - Diagrams – what are you building?
  - Identifying threats – what can go wrong?
  - Hands-on: STRIDE analysis of an Internet of Things (IoT) deployment
    with an on premise gateway and secure update service
  - Addressing each threats
  - Hands-on: threat mitigations OAuth scenarios for web and mobile
    applications

#### Keywords

Threat Modeling, STRIDE, Technical risk assessment

#### Abstract

This is a one day version of our Black Hat training on Threat Modeling.
The students will be challenged to perform practical threat modeling in
groups of 3 to 4 people covering the different stages of threat modeling
on:

  - An Internet of Things (IoT) deployment with an on premise gateway
    and secure update service
  - An HR services OAuth scenario for mobile and web applications

Threat modeling is a structured activity for identifying and evaluating
application threats and vulnerabilities. It also allows consideration of
security issues at the component or application level. The threat
modeling course will teach you to perform threat modeling through a
series of workshops, where our trainer will guide you through the
different stages of a practical threat model.
This course is aimed at software developers, architects, system managers
or security professionals. Before attending this course, students should
be familiar with basic knowledge of web and mobile Applications,
databases & Single sign on (SSO) principles.

#### Bio

Sebastien (lead application security consultant Toreon) led engagements
in the domain of ICT-security, Web and Mobile Security with several
customers in the private and public sector. Sebastien is the Belgian
OWASP Chapter Leader and is co-project leader of OWASP SAMM.

### Secure Development: Models and best practices by Bart De Win

#### Topic(s)

  - Software Assurance maturity models
  - Secure Development in agile development
  - Tips and tricks for practical SDLC
  - Hands-on: SAMM analysis of your enterprise using SAMM 1.5
  - Sneak preview of SAMM 2.0

#### Keywords

SDLC, SAMM, Agile development,

#### Abstract

It takes much more than a good developer to build secure software within
an organisation. Indeed, building secure software is about ensuring that
security is taken into consideration during the entire software
lifecycle. It is about ensuring that security best practices are being
employed efficiently, and that uncovered risks are appropriately dealt
with in due time.

During this one-day training, we will introduce and discuss different
secure development approaches and models. We will look into waterfall
vs. agile development and discuss different strategies to successfully
run an SDLC program. Finally, we will also put theorie into practice and
take your organisation to perform a mini SDLC assessment and improvement
exercise.

## Talks

### Attribute Based Access Control. Why, what, how? by Jacoba Sieders

#### Abstract

Digitization is rapidly transforming the traditional world and
regulation on security and data protection is gaining weight. Digital
identity, but also data protection become crucial capabilities for
businesses. What are the trends in IAM and what role can Attribute Based
Access Control (ABAC) play here? ABNAMRO started implementing ABAC in
2014. What were the approach and the lessons learnt?

accountable for digital identity services and access control for
customers, employees and partners to the bank’s data and infrastructure.
Major topics on her agenda today are ABAC, data centric security,
API-banking and PSDII requirements, the interaction of IAM tools with
the rest of the bank’s cybersecurity landscape, and the new
authentication concept for which ABNAMRO is acquiring a patent. Her
special interests are legal requirements impacting identity, e.g.
Generic Data Protection Regulation, the EU e-IDAS scheme, KYC and AML

### How to spend $3.6mil on one coding mistake, and other fun stuff you can do with $3.6mil by Matias Madou

#### Abstract

In a recent global study, the average cost of a data breach is $3.62M
globally. This session will discuss infamous examples of data breaches
that has made headlines around the world. We will explore the technical
details of the vulnerability itself and what a coding solution may have
been to prevent the breach. We will also dive deeper on exploring
different solutions, processes and techniques you can apply in your
day-to-day to prevent application security vulnerabilities in your code.

### The evil friend in your browser by Achim D. Brucker

#### Abstract

On the one hand, browser extensions, e.g., for Chrome, are very useful,
as they extend web browsers with additional functionality (e.g.,
blocking ads). On the other hand, they are the most dangerous code that
runs in your browsers: extension can read and modify both the content
displayed in the browser. As they also can communicate with any web-site
or web-service, they can report both data and metadata to external
parties.

The current security model for browser extensions seems to be inadequate
for expressing the security or privacy needs of browser users.
Consequently, browser extensions are a "juice target" for attackers
targeting web users.

We present results of analysing over 60000 browser extensions on how
they use the current security model and discuss examples of extensions
that are potentially of high risk. Based on the results of our analysis
of real world browser extensions as well as our own threat model, we
discuss the limitations of the current security model form a user
perspective. need of browser users.

#### Bio

Dr. Achim D. Brucker (www.brucker.uk) is a Senior Lecturer and

### Exploring the ecosystem of malicious domain registrations in the .eu TLD by Lieven Desmet

#### Abstract

In this talk, we report on an extensive analysis of 14 months of domain
registration in the .eu TLD. The purpose is to identify large-scale
malicious campaigns. Overall, the dataset of this study contains 824,121
new domain registrations; 2.53% of which have been flagged as malicious
by blacklisting services. We explore the ecosystem and modus operandi of
elaborate cybercriminal entities that recurrently register large amounts
of domains for one-shot, malicious use. Although these malicious domains
are short-lived, we establish that at least 80.04% of them can be framed
in to 20 larger campaigns with varying duration and intensity. We
further report on insights in the operational aspects of this business
and observe, amongst other findings, that their processes are only
partially automated.

#### Bio

Lieven Desmet is a Senior Research Manager on Secure Software in the
imec-DistriNet Research Group at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven
(Belgium), where he outlines and implements the research strategy,
coaches junior researchers in application security, and participates in

### Don't trust the DOM: Bypassing XSS mitigations via script gadgets by Sebastian Lekies

#### Abstract

Cross-Site Scripting is a constant problem of the Web platform. Over the
years many techniques have been introduced to prevent or mitigate XSS.
Most of these techniques, thereby, focus on script tags and event
handlers. HTML sanitizers, for example, aim at removing potentially
dangerous tags and attributes. Another example is the Content Security
Policy, which forbids inline event handlers and aims at white listing of
legitimate scripts.

In this talk, we present a novel Web hacking technique that enables an
attacker to circumvent most XSS mitigations. In order to do so, the
attacker abuses so-called script gadgets. A script gadget Is a
legitimate piece of JavaScript in a page that reads elements from the
DOM via selectors and processes them in a way that results in script
execution. To abuse a script gadget, the attacker injects a benign
looking element into the page that matches the gadget's selector.
Subsequently, the gadget selects the benign-looking element and executes
attacker-controlled scripts. As the initially injected element is benign
it passes HTML sanitizers and security policies. The XSS only surfaces
when the gadget mistakenly elevates the privileges of the element.

In this talk, we will demonstrate that these gadgets are present in
almost all modern JavaScript libraries, APIs and applications. We will
present several case studies and real-world examples that demonstrate
that many mitigation techniques are not suited for modern applications.
As a result, we argue that the Web should start focusing more on
preventive mechanisms instead of mitigations.

### A Series of Unfortunate Events: Where Malware Meets Murphy by Mattijs van Ommeren

#### Abstract

When an end user reports some “strange looking file names”, which, after
investigating, you discover include several hundreds of Gigabytes of
encrypted data, you of course know you are going to have a bad day. Your
AV solution has failed you, your firewall has failed you, and your SIEM
has failed you. Basically, every piece of security infrastructure you
have put your trust (and money) into has left you out in the cold and
you thank <deity of choice> that at least the nightly backup was
completed successfully. Spin up the tape drive, and soon you will be
back in business, or not…?

This talk is about failure. Not only about a failing security
infrastructure, but also about failure in doing the Right Thing™ as a
first responder, about the failure of Operating System tools, failing
APIs, and ironically, also the failure of malware (which is
unfortunately not as positive as it may sound). The scenario presented
comes pretty close to the worst chain of events you can imagine, in an
attempt to recover from a ransomware incident.

Luckily – this story has a happy ending. We will reveal how one can be
prepared for when both Count Olaf and Murphy come knocking on your door
simultaneously.

#### Bio

Mattijs van Ommeren has been poking hardware and software for 15 years.
He has spent most of his working life as a security consultant,
attacking and defending both traditional IT environments as well as more
esoteric embedded devices and industrial systems. Presently he has a lot
of fun at Nixu.

### Common REST API security pitfalls by Philippe De Ryck

#### Abstract

The shift towards a REST API landscape indicates a significant evolution
in the way we build applications. The rise of JavaScript and mobile
applications have sparked an explosion of easily-accessible REST APIs.
But how do you protect access to your API? Which security aspects are no
longer relevant? Which security features are an absolutely must-have,
and which additional security measures do you need to take into account?

These are hard questions, as evidenced by the deployment of numerous
insecure REST APIs. Attend this session to find out about common API
security pitfalls, that often result in compromised user accounts and
unauthorized access to your data. We expose the problem that lies at the
root of each of these pitfalls, and offer actionable advice to address
these security problems. After this session, you will know how to assess
the security of your APIs, and the best practices to improve them
towards the future.

#### Bio

Philippe De Ryck is a professional speaker and trainer on software

practitioners.

### Creating An AppSec Pipeline With Containers In A Week How We Failed And Succeeded by Jeroen Willemsen

#### Abstract

Join us on our adventure of setting up a appsec pipeline with Docker
containers. What did go wrong, how did we succeed? How do you fight
false positives and how do you get the best out of the products out
there without bothering the development teams too much.

#### Bio

Jeroen Willemsen is a security architect with a passion for mobile and
risk management. He loves to work on secure building blocks, security
automation pipelines and embedding information security risk management
controls in an agile environment. He is dedicated to help developers,
product owners and architects to take security seriously in their daily
development life (but not too serious of course ;-)).In his spare time
he loves to experiment with new technologies and frameworks.”

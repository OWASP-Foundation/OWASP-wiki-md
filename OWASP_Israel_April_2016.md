Security architect’s day can be full with processes and formalities, it
is a crucial part of the architects’ work and allow the risk management
to be possible in an enterprise.

I would like to focus on the day to day work to present how technical it
is and how to take the security to the next level when talking about
releases, the discussion with developers, the research and the
innovations\!

In my presentation, I will refer to number of use cases from the last
few months; Docker, Redis, e2e encryption, etc..

''' 18:05 – 18:50
''' ''' Regulating Cyber Security Disciplines *'
*' Avi Weismann, See Security '''

The cyber security field in Israel employs a variety of professionals in
various cyber security disciplines. Those professionals vary
significantly in their professional level and no assurance is provided
regarding their professional expertise to assist organizations to
appropriately handle cyber security threats and incident. That was the
background for the Cyber Security professions regulation, that is
designed to assure the professionalism, integrity and ethics of cyber
security professionals.

In light of the complexity of the regulation matter, and since the
purpose has been deem required, minimal professional requirements were
established in order to appropriately deal with various threats such as:
defense, public safety, national economy.

The regulating document strictly defines a significant part of cyber
security disciplines, and will in the feature define minimal
professional requirements in the form of: Independent certification by
the NCB, and\\or Internationally recognized vendor-free certifications,
and\\or Internationally recognized vendor-specific certifications.

The presentation shall describe the NCB decisions thus far and the
upcoming steps to assure the professional level of cyber security
professionals in Israel.

''' 18:50 – 19:05

''' 19:05 – 19:25
''' ''' When Crypto Fails – can we actually break AES? *'

There is a common misconception that strong cryptography provides the
required “silver bullet” just because its being used.

However, in reality, cryptography is far from being a trivial subject
and using cryptography correctly does requires us to understand the
“little bits” and the weaknesses of the algorithms that are being
used.

In this short presentation I will try to touch the “tip of the iceberg”
with demonstration of practical attacks that totally breaks CBC based
ciphers such as DES, 3DES and AES.

''' 19:25 – 20:15
''' ''' The bits DO matter: Extreme Penetration Testing Techniques *'

Normally, pen-testing a system is a process defined by whatever
available interfaces and GUI the application is exposing. Each type of
interface or protocol requires a different approach, for which many
proven tools exist. Most systems can be tested through their GUI layer
up to an acceptable level.

Similarly, most internal components and interfaces can be thoroughly
tested given relevant internal access. Books and best practices are
published for most of the security testing areas and approaches, hence
(almost) nothing new under the sun and it takes serious efforts to
extend the current know-how. Sometimes a tested system or component has
no GUI whatsoever. This is no obstacle for professionals, since proven
techniques like Reversing, Memory Analysis, Code Review and Debug will
be implemented.

However, when Reversing, Memory Analysis or Debug are not feasible or
practical and Code Review is known to be limited, a different approach
is required. This is the case for example when the components to be
tested are internal and bounded at a level such that using said auditing
techniques is not practical.

The revival of Penetration Testing: the Extreme approach. The
presentation will demonstrate a hands-on practical approach for extreme
pen-testing when other techniques are not feasible. We will discuss the
typical problems and limitations, introduce a solution and review its
advantages, effectiveness (and limitations) over other techniques.

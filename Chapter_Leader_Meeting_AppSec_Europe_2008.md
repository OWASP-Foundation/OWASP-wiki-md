\===Discussion=== (Mat) Contents: - Discuss about new ideas to improve
each OWASP Chapter - How every chapter should help OWASP growing faster
- Involve people and media

  - Involve people in OWASP

Local security events: it is important that the local chapter should
participate to the Security event in your country? For example
InfoSecurity, ISACA local conferences. OWASP Days (Week) in your
countries: a case of success? How many OWASP week should we organize in
a year? Affiliation: How many chapters are affiliate with ISACA, ISSA,
ISC2 and local InfoSecurity organizations? Is that important for the
Chapter?

  - Involve people to adopt OWASP

Survey: should we set up a local survey to interview the CSO of local
Companies about the adoption of OWASP Guidelines in they company? Should
be interesting for OWASP to know how many companies adopt OWASP and also
to know the Return of Security Investment (ROSI) related the
implementation of security process in the Software Development Life
Cycle (Secure Design, Threat Modeling, Code Review, Web Application
Penetration Testing)?

  - Involve media

Articles: it is important to set up a team in your chapter dedicated
writing article and news on local Security Magazine and e-zine? Should
we create an OWASP team for writing articles that could be published on
all local magazine countries? Journalists: involve journalist to
participate to the OWASP conferences

### Proposals

\- Dave: how can OWASP growing faster? Is a good way to find a new
employee with the goal to increase the number of OWASP members?
\- Dinis: How to spend the OWASP money collected from Conferences and
memberships in the better way? OWASP SoC Conference in Portugal: we can
pay the fly and hotel for SoC projects leaders and 2 reviewers or
authors What if we publish OWASP books also for beta and alpha
projects
\- Ivan: Improve our site to be more professional, publish only quality
OWASP project into a book
\- Seba: Books put in circulation should really be of release quality.
These books are supposed to be viral. People who are new to OWASP should
get a good first impression.

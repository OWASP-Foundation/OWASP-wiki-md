## Meeting minutes December 20th 2007

At December 20th, the Dutch OWASP chapter came together at the office of
ps_testware located in Doorn. The subject of the evening was 'creating
secure (web)applications. There were 3 speakers and close to 30
attendees

**First presentation:** Practices of developing optimal security
(dutch), Andre Post
Andre talked from his rich experience as software auditor and code
reviewer. Based on his experience he stated that developing good, secure
software can only be done with developers with the right set of mind.
Security should not be tested into the software, but should be a natural
thing for developers to develop into the software. For this you need
developers who know by heart when security flaws start to exist and how
to prevent them. Developers with the necessary experience are rare and
often developer teams do not have the right expertise for developing
secure software. The most important conclusion of his speech was that
secure software starts with security aware developers.

**Second presentation:** Problems of developing secure and correct
applications (dutch), Erik Poll
Erik Poll stated that besides having developers who are aware of
security, you should also have developers that now the limitations and
inherent security leaks of the used language. One of the problems is
that many developers are not taught the inherent security holes in
programming languages during their education.
Another problem is that software is often made secure for the wrong
reasons. At this moment only two reasons appear to be the drive behind
developing secure software: economics and laws. Security is mostly of
secondary concern and as such will only be implemented at minimum
requirements. Bad examples of big companies who develop insecure
software and still be successful even further restrict the demand for
secure software.
On the positive side many developers make the same mistakes so testing
for common security holes can easily be done with checklists and
validation tools. These validation tools can be made more successful
with the use of metatags in the code.
Erik concluded his speech that improving the secureness of software can
only be achieved when there is commitment, the knowledge is available
and software is developed and implemented with a secure mind.

**Third presentation:** Protecting Web services and Web applications
against security threats, Rix Groenboom
The third presentation was about a problem which probably will become
bigger and bigger the coming years. Although security might be in the
scope when developing software at this moment, it certainly was not a
requirement 20 or more years ago. Despite their intrinsic insecureness,
these systems are connected more and more to the world wide web to meet
de demands for online availability. This imposes a major security risk
which will become more evident in the years to come and might become
bigger than the Y2K problem. Unlike modern software, these applications
can only be made secure enough by using advanced testing strategies
combined with the use of test-tools and thorough regression tests.
Testing alone however is not enough; to accomplish maximum secureness
all connections to these systems should be based on a 'deny unless'
instead of an 'allow unless' basis.
The conclusion of Rix's talk was that old systems connected to new
interfaces should be treated as insecure and all possible precautions
should be taken to achieve an acceptable level of secureness.

## Meeting December 20th 2007: Secure Development

**Summary**
The main goal of the upcoming OWASP-NL meeting is to provide information
to developers and security professionals involved in creating secure
(web-)applications. The general and specific security issues involved on
project and programming level will be covered from a practical as well
as a theoretical point of view. The speakers will give specific examples
and of course there is time to ask questions about your own
experiences.
Please register before December the 14th because of the necessary
catering arrangements.

## Meeting March 9th 2007: Second meeting of the OWASP Netherlands local chapter\!

In this second meeting focus groups are to be formed, to discuss common
problems, develop and research common solutions in a vendor neutral
environment. So this is a very good opportunity to get in contact with
others, to exchange knowledge and experiences on specific topics.

For every focus group the following questions has to be answered:
1\. Which specific topic is to be addressed?
2\. What are the deliverables?
3\. What is the relation to OWASP? (Current projects, materials,
expertise and knowledge interchange, etc.)
4\. Who is the central contact of the subgroup?

It would be nice to have a bigger and more diverse group, compared to
the first meeting. So let's recall: "Please, bring at least one friend,
next time." And don't hesitate to send this announcement to everybody
who may be interested\!

We thank Getronics PinkRoccade for offering us a venue:

The agenda:
18.00 - 18.30 Check-In
18.30 - 18.45 Opening
18.45 - 19.30 Improving Security in the Application Development
Life-cycle, Migchiel de Jong
19.30 - 20.00 Collecting focus group initiatives
19.45 - 20.00 Coffee break
20.00 - 21.00 Form focus groups

Presentation Abstract
Rather than spending large amounts of time and money on proving that we
have security vulnerabilities after programs go into production,
companies should go to the source and correct vulnerabilities as early
as possible in the development stage. It is unquestionably faster,
simpler, and cheaper for developers to correct vulnerabilities as they
build programs.
But how can development management ensure that developers focus on
security when there is no time or budget for security at the development
stage? Even with the correct focus, how can they learn what to look for?
How can they stay ahead of the dedicated and resourceful hacker?
The answer is effective processes and better tools. With advanced
software security tools, a developer can pinpoint vulnerabilities in a
matter of seconds — the same vulnerabilities that would take a hacker or
manual code reviewer weeks or even months to find. These same tools can
give development and information security managers useful metrics on
application vulnerabilities before they are released into deployment.
This talk will walk through the Application Development Life-Cycle and
discuss how tools can help come to grips with software security issues
in a particular phase.

About the presenter
Migchiel de Jong has developed hardware and software for 10 years before
joining Rational Software. During the 5 years at Rational Software
(later acquired by IBM) he was involved in many software development
process improvement projects. Currently Migchiel de Jong is working at
Fortify Software, Palo Alto, California, as a software security
engineer.

## Meeting minutes Januar 11th 2007

January 11th, the Dutch OWASP chapter came together at the office of
Sogeti Netherlands. Subject of the evening was 'putting software
security into practice'. The group was small but select.

The agenda:
18.00 - 18.30 Check-In (catering included)
18.30 - 18.45 Sponsor opening
18.45 - 19.00 OWASP update, Bert Koelewijn

19.30 - 19.45 Panel introduction
19.45 - 20.00 Coffee break
20.00 - 21.30 Panel discussion

After being welcomed by Frank Langeveld from Sogeti and Bert Koelewijn,
Dutch chapter leader, the evening started with the presentation
'Security By Design'. During the presentation Martin Knobloch told about
his experiences during the implementation of the Secure Development Life
Cycle in a company like Sogeti Nederland B.V.

The presentation is available here:
[Media:Implementation_of_Security_by_Design.ppt](Media:Implementation_of_Security_by_Design.ppt "wikilink")

After a small break, the panel discussion started with the following
panel: Henk van der Heijden - Comsec Consulting, Dr.ir. Mario de Boer -
LogicaCMG and Martin Knobloch - Sogeti Nederland.
During the discussion, it became clear people are struggling to get the
Secure Development Life Cycle implemented in their company. The various
experiences were shared with the panel and the others. Company typical
problems and common misunderstandings about Software security where
brought up.
The consensus of the discussion was that the main problem lies in the
lack of security awareness and knowledge of the managers and the
developers. And this of course is exactly where OWASP comes in…


## Meeting Januar 11th 2007

The OWASP meeting of 11 January is about putting software security into
practice. A lot of books, standards, organizations and consultants tell
us how we should develop secure software. But which methods and measures
are commonly adopted and which are not and why?
This will be the main focus of the discussion that we will have with a
panel of people that experienced implementing software security in the
field.

The location is provided by the sponsor of this meeting:
Sogeti Nederland B.V.
"La Charmille" building
Lange Dreef 17
4131 NJ Vianen

The agenda:

19.00 - 19.30 Implementation of Security by Design, Martin Knobloch
19.30 - 19.45 Panel introduction
19.45 - 20.00 Coffee break
20.00 - 21.30 Panel discussion

Implementation of Security by Design
What is needed to implement a 'Secure Development Life Cycle' within
Sogeti Nederland? The speaker started a project called 'Security by
Design' in march 2006 implementing a SDLC at Sogeti Nederland.
In his presentation, the speaker will share his technical and
organizational experiences that he gained with the still ongoing
implementation.

About the speaker
Martin Knobloch has more than 8 years experience in design and
development of J2EE applications for customers in various sectors of the
market. In September 2003 Martin Knobloch started working for Sogeti
Nederland, where he does the design, development and review of J2EE
applications and architectures.
From this background, Martin Knobloch experienced the threats of
insecure software firsthand. In march 2006, Martin Knobloch started
implementing a SDLC within Sogeti Nederland.

Panel discussion
The panel members are:
Henk van der Heijden, Managing Director - Comsec Consulting B.V.
Dr.ir. Mario de Boer, Security Consultant - LogicaCMG
Martin Knobloch, Senior Technologie Specialist - Sogeti Nederland B.V.

In the discussion, we will try to find answers to questions like:
\- What are the most common security practices in software
development?
\- How effective are those practices?
\- Where do we start practicing security?
\- What should be the most common security practices in software
development?
\- How much does security cost?
\- How does the Systems Security Engineering Capability Maturity Model
(SSE-CMM) fit in?

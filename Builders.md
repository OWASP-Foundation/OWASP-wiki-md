<strong>What Are OWASP Communities?</strong></p>
<p>Builders, <a href="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Breakers">Breakers</a> and <a href="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Defenders">Defenders</a>; the idea of OWASP Communities is to bring together experts in the area that they are best at with the common goal of advancing the state of application security. This approach allows similar groups of professionals and experts to tackle security problems with the involvement of the most relevant stakeholders. The intent is to drive high quality output that is immediately usable by the target audience. More information about this vision can be found <a href="http://michael-coates.blogspot.com/2011/02/vision-for-owasp.html">here</a>.</p></td>

#### Developer Outreach

Get involved in the Developer Outreach by subscribing to the ...

  - [Steering List (low
    traffic)](https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/developer-outreach)
  - [Google Group (for
    discussions)](https://groups.google.com/group/owasp-dev-outreach-discuss)

The first priority of the Builders Community is to reach out to
developers and ask what application security is lacking today. An
initial lightweight outreach was performed early March 2011.

### Developers' Security Itches March 2011

The overall results of the initial outreach can be seen in the diagram
below (categorization by John Wilander, full-text available via links
below). This is a first glimpse at what developers think are the
problems and challenges for application security.

Full data searchable via the online database <https://www.grubba.net>
(account 'owasp'/'owasp') or available in a .csv file
[here](http://www.owasp.org/images/e/e0/OWASP_Developer_Outreach_Iteration_1.csv.zip).

### "Lack of Security in Frameworks"

Here's what the developers said in the number one category "Lack of
Security in Frameworks":

Question: **What are your security itches?**

  - *NMP (not my problem), aka should be handled by the used frameworks*
    (spring, struts, etc). \[Java and C\# developer, 5 years of
    experience\]
  - *The idea that you can tackle all security problems with spring
    security.* \[Java and C\# developer, 5 years of experience\]
  - *I want more/most/all implementation-level security issues taken
    care of at the language and framework level. There are far too many
    security problems that are left to developers to understand and take
    care of.* \[Java and JavaScript developer, 15 years experience\]
  - *Libraries and frameworks have insecure defaults (example: JSP's
    c:out). Webapp frameworks doesnt keep up with the security
    landscape, and there are no quick fixes to add security to these. No
    central place for developers for different languages and frameworks,
    making it hard to find the good solutions (making people solve the
    same problems over and over, with different success rate).* \[Java
    and JavaScript developer, 6 years of experience\]
  - *Things I don't have control over. 3rd party DB drivers, image
    libraries, all kind of framework.* \[C\# and Java developer, 10
    years of experience\]
  - *Frameworks missing mechanisms for solving common security problems
    (CSRF, http-only etc.)* \[Java and Ruby developer, 3 years
    experience\]
  - *Lack of security support in frameworks.* \[Java developer, 15 years
    of experience\]
  - *Picking secure components.* \[Java and Scala developer, 8 years of
    experience\]
  - *Missing a lot of functionality in frameworks for handling common
    security issues.* \[Java and JavaScript developer, 10 years of
    experience\]
  - *Secure by default, i e default settings in frameworks would be
    nice.* \[Java and JavaScript developer, 10 years of experience\]

### "Security Info Hard to Find"

Here's what the developers said in the runner up category "Security Info
Hard to Find":

Question: **What are your security itches?**

  - *Security is very seldom covered in the channels developers listen
    to, e.g. developer conferences.* \[Java and JavaScript developer, 10
    years experience\]
  - *Which tools are good enough? Which frameworks are good enough? Can
    I trust Google when searching for security solutions? How else to
    ask?* \[Java developer, 12 years experience\]
  - *There are resources for that?* \[C\# developer, 10 years
    experience\]
  - *The security info channels you listen to are too noisy. Hard to
    know what's a real problem.* \[Java and JavaScript developer, 10
    years experience\]
  - *Would like to see a matrix with various frameworks on one axis and
    security issues such as OWASP Top 10 on the other. Cells contain
    links to solutions.* \[Java and JavaScript developer, 10 years
    experience\]
  - *Would like a comparison of what is supported and not in the
    different web frameworks with regard to security (escaping &
    encoding, sql-injection, etc).* \[C\# and Ruby developer, 3 years
    experience\]
  - *Can't find resources.* \[PHP developer, 15 years experience\]
  - *Information is hard to find.* \[C\# developer, 4 years experience\]

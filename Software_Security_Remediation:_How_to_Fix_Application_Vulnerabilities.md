\==Description== **Course Length: 1 Day**

This class teaches attendees how to fix security vulnerabilities in
existing software. It provides a mix of discussion of project concerns
for planning and managing remediation efforts with hands-on coding
examples fixing specific vulnerabilities. Attendees will learn how to
risk-rank vulnerabilities, estimate remediation tasks, perform coding
fixes for vulnerabilities and demonstrate the effectiveness of fixes
applied. The focus is on the practical: how to use limited resources to
make significant improvements to the security of target applications.
Code examples use the OWASP ESAPI Java and Microsoft Web Protection
Library. Many classes teach developers how to build secure code from the
ground up or teach security analysts how to test applications for
security vulnerabilities. This class teaches developers and security
analysts how to deal with their existing portfolio of insecure
applications.

## Student Requirements

Attendees will need laptops with the ability to run a VMWare image that
will be provided.

## Objectives

Skill: Intermediate

1.  How to scope and plan software security remediation projects
2.  Code-level techniques to fix code containing common vulnerabilities
3.  How to demonstrate the software security fixes were effective

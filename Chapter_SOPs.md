## **Chapter Leader SOPs**

### Annual Tasks

1.  Have at least one planning meeting with the Chapter and the Board.
    At a minimum, decide which months you intend to meet. Monthly is
    pretty aggressive, but 8 times over the course of the year is pretty
    dang respectable
2.  Plan to present on current OWASP Projects. 1st or 2nd meeting of the
    year is good. Encourage participation, and try to leverage
    headlines. Solicit ideas for other projects and if appropriate,
    promote the new Chapter Project locally, with Chapter Sponsor (if
    any), and with the OWASP Board.
3.  Plan to solicit a Chapter Sponsor. A company who contributes
    thousands of dollars for an annual sponsorship provides a LOT of
    flexibility in terms of scheduling speakers, SnowFROC logistics, etc
4.  Plan to meet with your peers at ISSA, ISACA, and
    [SQuAD](http://www.squadco.com) meetings
5.  Find or be the volunteer to honcho SnowFROC
6.  Prepare and handoff to a worthy successor. It is tremendously
    difficult to find someone with the right combination of
    availability, integrity, common sense, and passion. It's even harder
    to tell the 2nd-best person that it's not their turn. It's really,
    really easy to hold an election and wash your hands of it, but it's
    painful if the election is stacked and a vendor/vendor rep wins and
    completely sucks forever. A bad leader will compromise the Chapter
    for years. Choose wisely.

### Quarterly Tasks

1.  Try to assemble the Board for coffee, lunch, beer, whatever. Get on
    the same page and brainstorm for the future. Have a candid
    conversation about what needs improvement and/or what worked so well
    it should be repeated. Have someone take and publish notes.
2.  Try to do at least one Outreach event - go on-site to do Developer
    Security Orientation at an organization, give a preso at
    ISSA/ISACA/SQuAD, get a meeting covered by the local TV News
    station, whatever
3.  Check for changes to OWASP policies or the Chapter Leaders' Handbook
4.  Update your OWASP Projects Preso
5.  See if you can budget time to attend the next major OWASP Con

### Monthly Tasks

1.  Get a speaker
2.  Get a host
3.  Get a sponsor
4.  Announce/publish per the Communications SOP above

### Weekly Tasks

1.  Check for new members pending on the Linked In group
2.  Eyeball Twitter and re-tweet relevant stuff

### Ongoing Tasks

1.  Be the Ambassador for the Chapter.
2.  Promote the CONCEPT of Secure Coding and the Chapter.
3.  Have a preso immediately available in case the Speaker falls
    through, and encourage your Board to do the same
4.  Have a preso ready for Community Outreach. Some organizations want
    OWASP to come on-site to educate their users, developers, etc. YOU
    are probably the person going on-site.
5.  Locate a host or facility for the meetings. Have a backup plan. Note
    that for 2012, average RSVP count was \~50 and average actual
    attendance was \~40
6.  Monitor the OWASP Leaders mailing list and make noise if the
    Organization's headed somewhere that will be detrimental to the
    Chapter. Learn from others on the list.

### Cat-herding Tips

Locally it's an all-volunteer organization, and as of 20121019 there are
only 4 people on the whole planet who get paychecks from OWASP. Everyone
else already has a day-job, and if OWASP isn't fun then only masochists
will show up. At that point it won't be fun for you either (unless
YOU'RE a masochist). It's going to take a lot of work to coordinate
schedules. It's going to feel a lot like chaos. Here are some principles
that will help keep the Team moving forward in the midst of chaos:

1.  Let your Team know what's going on. This includes ensuring that they
    get as much advance notice as possible if you know you're not going
    to be available for a meeting etc
2.  Try to stay current. You don't need to be the expert but it sure
    helps if you are at least able to cite recent examples of attacks
    against the OWASP Top 10 or WASC Top Whatever
3.  Know your limits - technical, inter-personal, and in terms of the
    time available to commit. BEFORE you exceed your limits, consider
    asking your Boardmembers for a hand.
4.  MAKE TIME to LEARN during meetings. It's very easy to get wrapped up
    in meeting logistics and/or chapter business during a preso. Try to
    set all that aside and LEARN.
5.  Get to know your Board, your Chapter Members, regional Chapters, and
    other regional ITSec organizations, and try to keep their interests
    (and needs) in mind.
6.  Set the example. Bring a Developer, bring a Tester, bring someone
    new to meetings. Pay to BE an OWASP member. BE PATIENT with nubes,
    especially Developers.
7.  Ensure that roles and tasks are understood and that you followup as
    appropriate to help ensure accomplishment
8.  Try to foster a team environment - including the Board, the Chapter,
    other Chapters (particularly on the Front Range), and other
    organizations (such as ISACA). Let the old-timers help the nubes.
    Denver InfoSec is a SMALL community, so building a team helps ensure
    that if the chips are down, true benefit can be derived from OWASP
    participation simply through leveraging connections of the "team."
9.  Make the call. Lots of stuff is OK to defer to committee. Some stuff
    isn't. Typical decisions involve meeting cancellations, SnowFROC
    logistics/planning/delegation/scoping, sponsor selection, etc. Think
    it through, ask for suggestions, but do NOT waffle - make a call and
    let the Team move forward.
10. Foster ownership. The Board should feel that they've got substantial
    ownership in the success of the Chapter, and members and attendees
    should feel it's THEIR Chapter. If you get hit by a bus, the Chapter
    should be able to continue its mission - education and outreach
11. Recognize what you can and can't do given your team, the time
    available, and the scope of the task. It is very, very difficult to
    estimate the amount of planning, labor, politics, and TIME to get
    something done. Go for the win, but don't be afraid to look people
    in the eye and ask "will YOU be on-point for this task and BRING IT
    HOME or are you just another guy with great ideas and no time to
    actually execute?" Be more tactful than that, but recognize that
    EVERYONE's got GREAT ideas but only FEW people have the TIME and
    COMMITMENT to DELIVER. Nothing to take personally - it's just the
    nature of volunteer organizations. The best idea in the world SUX if
    it costs you your day job.
12. The buck stops with you. Delegate to the extent that you can, but
    recognize that YOU are the face of the Chapter and ultimately
    responsible for its success or failure. No pressure, but keep this
    in mind when you're looking for your replacement.

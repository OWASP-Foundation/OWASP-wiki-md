# Introduction

Following the success of the [OWASP New
Zealand 2009](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2009)
security conference which attracted more than 150 attendees, the [OWASP
New Zealand Chapter](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/New_Zealand) decided
to organise the <b>OWASP New Zealand Day 2010</b>. The event was held on
the <b>15th July 2010</b> in <b>Auckland</b> and was a great conference
day. The event gathered an audience of 160 delegates including security
professionals, developers, managers and students.
For those people who missed the event or are interested in the
conference material, some of the
[presentations](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2010#tab=Presentations)
have been published and can be downloaded from the presentations page.
For any comments, feedback or observations, please don't hesitate to

<b>\*\*</b> <i>replaced Scott Bell's "Web Application Vulnerabilities:
How far does the rabbit hole go?" talk.</i>

#### Speakers

## Low Scuttling Chilli Crab:NETWORK RECON 2010AD \*\*

Network reconnaissance is an art as old as hacking, but the days of
dumpster diving and fingering your away around the 'net are long in our
past. In the world of Google, Wolfram |Alpha and Shodan, target
acquisition is king: there's a new exploit every day, who's going down
after you've finished your first cup of coffee tomorrow?

In this presentation, Metlstorm examines the practicality,
implementation and effect of datamining country-scale network targeting
databases. Building on the experience of spending the previous year
mapping the New Zealand internet for his Kiwicon 2009 talk "Do Your
Fruit Hang Low", Metlstorm deploys the Low Hanging Kiwifruit toolchain
against its newest target: Singapore.

So, Singapore, are your networks open? How many open DSL routers are
there in Singapore? Which ISP has their blade switches open for you to
telnet to? Just how useful is it to full text search every SSL
certificate name, 302 Redirect target and DNS entry?

<b>Metlstorm</b>

Metlstorm is an independent unix hacker from New Zealand, where he milks
both sheep and hobbits. In the brief gaps in this bucolic schedule, he
finds time to organise Kiwicon - the NZ hacker con, co-host the
award-winning Risky.biz weekly infosec podcast and hold down a day job
as a whitehat security consultant. In true sellout style, Metl has
worked the floor at Blackhat, Defcon, Kiwicon & Ruxcon, achieving minor
notoriety at the latter for being the only speaker ever punched out by a
member of the audience at the end of his talk. Metlstorm loves bugs that
are features, carrier networks and "enterprise" unix software, because
we all know that "enterprise" means "the 80s called, they want their
long environment variables back".

\- <i>replaced Scott Bell's "Web Application Vulnerabilities: How far
does the rabbit hole go?" talk</i>.

## Dean Carter - The Ramblings of an ex-QSA

As a QSA there were a bunch of things Dean was forbidden from
discussing.

As an ex QSA some of these matters will remain firmly sequestered inside
his kimono - but others things, more general things, can now be shared.

Dean has 30 minutes worth of handy tips, hints, lessons and some
brickbats relating to PCI and secure system development that he can now
share with the community.

<b>Dean Carter</b>

Dean still remembers the day he first heard about the PCI DSS - he then
spent several years trying to convince everyone that the PCI DSS was the
bestest thing since the Beatles… not many people listened… they had
projects to finish and settings to tweak…

Then Dean joined Security-Assessment.com and became a QSA (PCI
power-up\!)… people listened\! Organisations even paid to listen\! A few
organisations went so far as to demonstrate their security posture to
Dean The QSA. In return he signed their Reports on Compliance. Most made
great progress towards compliance… while some simply went in political
circles and denied the need to make any effort.

Two years on Dean, the ex-QSA, now works for financial institution
where, in between other tasks, he regularly sticks his nose into PCI
matters and still firmly believes that the PCI DSS is a positive thing.

## Paul Craig – Security-Assessment.com - "Oh F\#\!K" : What To Do When You Get Pwned

If your company’s website were hacked tomorrow, would you know what to
do? Forensics is not what you see on CSI, and most people have no idea
what they should do in the event of a compromise. What is an appropriate
incident response for a company, what do you say to your CEO, when do
you involve law enforcement? Do you attempt to solve the forensic case
yourself; keeping in mind any action you take may directly affect the
evidence, or compromise legal judicial requirements. This presentation
will demonstrate the forensic process for a compromised website, and
what an organization should do when they find out they have been
compromised. I will use case studies from previous incidents and
demonstrate what you should and shouldn’t do when you get pwned.

<b>Paul Craig</b>

My name is Paul Craig, I work as the lead forensic incident responder at
Security-Assessment.com and I work with many New Zealand companies who
have been compromised. From small websites to large corporations and
government agencies, our nation is regularly being defaced and
defrauded. IT Forensics is here to pick up the pieces, and it’s my job
to spend long nights trying to provide answers to businesses regarding
what really happened.

## Brett Moore - Insomnia Security - "Don't Try This At Home"

During source code and application reviews a number of common issues are
often seen. Developers making the same mistakes time and time again.
There are also those 'unique' issues that only come up once in a while,
when people handroll their own methods to solve a particular problem.

Over the course of this talk, the speaker will explain and describe a
number of issues that he has seen over the last 24 months in locally
developed code. This is an opportunity to see what local developers are
doing wrong, and why you shouldn't try this at home.

<b>Brett Moore</b>

Having conducted vulnerability assessments, network reviews, and
penetration tests for the majority of the large companies in New
Zealand, Insomnia founder Brett Moore brings with him over eight years
experience in information security. During this time, Brett has also
worked with companies such as SUN Microsystems, Skype Limited and
Microsoft Corporation by reporting and helping to fix security
vulnerabilities in their products. Brett has released numerous
whitepapers and technical postings related to security issues and has
spoken at security conferences both locally and overseas, including
BlackHat, Defcon, Syscan, Kiwicon, Ruxcon, and the invitation only
Microsoft internal security conference called BlueHat.

## Graeme Neilson / Kirk Jackson - Aura Software Security / Xero - Tales from the Crypt0

Does the thought of SSL, HTTPS and S/MIME make you squeamish? Does PKI
make you want to scream? Does encrypting data at rest make you want to
bury yourself alive?

Cryptography is an important part of most web applications these days,
and developers and admins need to understand how, why and when to employ
the best and appropriate techniques to secure their servers,
applications, data and the livelihoods of their users.

Join Graeme Neilson (Aura Software Security) and Kirk Jackson (Xero) for
a series of scary stories in "Tales from the Crypt0".

<b>Graeme Neilson</b>

Graeme Neilson is lead security researcher at Aura Software Security, a
security consultancy based in Wellington with clients across the globe.

<b>Kirk Jackson</b>

Kirk Jackson is a developer at Xero, makers of the world's easiest
accounting system.

## Quintin Russ / Mike Jager - SiteHost / Web Drive - Hosting and Web Apps - The Obscurity of Security

The security of web applications has traditionally been considered to be
the problem of the company whose servers they were hosted upon. However,
while you can outsource the hosting of web apps, you cannot outsource
the responsibility of ensuring that those apps are secure. Mike and
Quintin set aside their corporate rivalry to demonstrate the gap between
the way things are and the way things should be.

<b>Quintin Russ</b>

Quintin has carved out his own niche in the .nz hosting industry, having
spent a large proportion of the last few years becoming an expert in
both building and defending systems. He now runs enough infrastructure
to ensure he never, ever gets a good night's sleep, and sometimes
doesn't even get to snooze through Sunday mornings. Quintin has a keen
interest in security, especially as it relates to web hosting. This has
ranged from the vicissitudes of shared hosting to code reviews of
popular blogging applications. He has previously presented at ISIG and
Kiwicon 2009.

<b>Mike Jager</b>

Since his arrival at Web Drive in 2004, Mike has been sticking his
fingers into the wall sockets of web hosting. Currently, he herds
packets, mutters at clouds, and sneaks up on web applications, tricking
them into scaling horizontally when they least expect it. Mike holds a
BE in Computer Systems Engineering from the University of Auckland, and
has been spotted presenting recently at NZNOG, APRICOT and the
occasional ISIG meeting.

## Roberto Suggi Liverani - Security-Assessment.com - Defending Against Application Level DoS Attacks

Secure code practices, system hardening, due diligence and due care
principles are paramount in mitigating application level DoS attacks.
These attacks often result in significant damage against unprepared and
vulnerable organisations.

The intent of this talk is to help organisations in strengthening their
security posture against such attacks. The talk will explore most common
application level DoS attacks and will provide recommendations for
protecting applications, detecting attacks and how to react under
stressful conditions.

<b>Roberto Suggi Liverani</b>

Roberto Suggi Liverani is a senior security consultant for
Security-Assessment.com. He is the founder and leader of the OWASP (Open
Web Application Security Project) in New Zealand. Roberto has worked
with companies such as Google, Adobe and Opera by reporting and helping
to fix security vulnerabilities in their products. Roberto is the
co-author of the most recent OWASP Testing Guide and has spoken at
various security conferences around the globe.

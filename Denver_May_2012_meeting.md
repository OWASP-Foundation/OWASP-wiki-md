### Hands-on XSS'ing

Please bring a laptop that has wireless capability with a copy of
WebScarab & Firefox installed. Steve Kosten will discuss XSS and show
and tell us how to use it. The content will be geared towards those who
have little to no experience using a web proxy or application testing
and want to learn, especially XSS.

Welcome to SnowFROC, the Winter 2009 Front Range OWASP Application
Security Conference\!

Thanks to our witty speakers, volunteer organizers, enthusiastic
attendees, and gracious sponsors, the event was packed and full of
energy. Thanks to those of you who completed the Survey. Survey results
are

After a successful FROC in June of 2008, we are back in Denver, Colorado
USA on 5 March 2009\!

**This year we again present a full day, FREE multi-track conference,
which will provide valuable information for managers and executives as
well as developers and engineers.**

In 2008, we attracted a packed venue with our great AppSec speakers, and
we hope to achieve the same again in 2009. This year we organized the
conference to occur during the peak of the [Colorado ski
season](http://www.google.com/search?q=colorado+skiing), so that
speakers can head up to the nearby mountains before and/or after the
conference to enjoy some of the legendary snow.

## Conference Location

## Capture the Flag (CTF)

CTF is OPEN\!

If you are attending FROC, join WiFi network "Auraria Campus" and browse
to [the CTF main page](http://ctf.technowarfare.com). If you need help,
email edupreyATowasp.org or visit the CTF lounge upstairs from the
vendor area.

This year FROC will be hosting a capture the flag game / contest
throughout the day. The CTF consists of a LAMP web server target and a
scoreboard.

Your job as a player is to successfully attack the small vulnerable web
applications we provide to obtain hidden codes (called "flags".) Enter a
flag into the scoreboard and you're credited with the point value for
that challenge.

An entrant can be a team or an individual. Small prizes will be given
for the top three finishing entrants, but the greatest prize, of course,
is bragging rights. Winners will be announced (and prizes awarded) at
the end of the conference as part of the conference wrap-up.

Thanks to:

  - IBM for sponsoring this event and providing technical support.
  - Dan Guido and the rest of the team of students from Polytechnic
    University for developing the code the contest is based on. (this
    CTF is a modified version of the one they presented at OWASP NYC
    2008)

### CTF Rules

1\. Don't attack other players. The contest is about finding and
exploiting vulnerabilities in the applications provided. (yes, attacking
application users is a real-world threat -- victims will be provided in
the challenges where attacking a user is required.)

2\. Don't attack the infrastructure. Networks, routers, and the
scoreboard are all off-limits as targets of attack.

Anyone discovered breaking these rules will earn banning, forfeiture of
all points, and very bad karma.

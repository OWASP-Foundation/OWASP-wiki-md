### Why this project?

The main goal of OWASP is to spread the word about security (“Our
mission is to make application security "visible," so that people and
organizations can make informed decisions about application security
risks.”) and OWASP has done great work so far. The number of native and
secondary speakers in the world for Chinese, Spanish, French, Russian,
Arabic and Indi languages are estimated in similar number to English
speaking or even more (Some References at
[Ethnologue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnologue_list_of_most_spoken_languages),
[Encarta](http://encarta.msn.com/media_701500404/Languages_Spoken_by_More_Than_10_Million_People.html),
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_number_of_native_speakers)).
It is a good time for OWASP to reach those that do not speak English to
have full access to all the OWASP materials, not just a couple of
documents.

### Objectives

This project is the pioneer of an effort to define basic guidelines for
the localization of OWASP site and OWASP projects (both documentation
and software). Also define a way to do a continuous effort to keep
information across the different languages in synchrony.
The main objective is to provide a framework for new translation
efforts, those effort will have 2 main objectives:

1.  Make OWASP information currently available, reach the people
    speaking of a specific language
2.  Allow non-English speaking people to contribute to OWASP and have
    internationalization projects transfer that knowledge to English and
    other languages. So as you can imagine the replication effect will
    have great benefits to the OWASP community and the world of
    application security.

### I want to translate OWASP Materials to \[Put your language here\], Where should I start?

Good for you, we are always happy to have more people to spread the
OWASP message. Our suggestion is:

1.  You Identify the project you like or can translate, you can go to
    page or contact [Paulo Coimbra](User:Paulo_Coimbra "wikilink") for a
    suggestion (he manages all the OWASP projects). Check
    [\#Active_Translation_Projects](#Active_Translation_Projects "wikilink")
    to see if there is an existing or ongoing translation to the
    materials you want to translate, ask the language project mailing
    list (OWASP-Spanish mailing list) or the material project leader
    (e.g OWASP Top 10 Leader, Dave Wickers)
2.  Check if there is an existent Language-specific project, that is
    look for a [OWASP_Spanish](OWASP_Spanish "wikilink") project if you
    are willing to translate to Spanish, There might be existing
    guidelines to help you out do the translation smoothly.
3.  Choose you approach:
      - If you want to translate only a small document or one page, just
        go and do it, follow the Language guidelines or
        [\#General_Translation_Guidelines](#General_Translation_Guidelines "wikilink")
        below.
      - If you want to translate various documents, consider to [create
        a Language-Specific
        Project](#Creating_a_Language_Specific_OWASP_Project "wikilink")
        that way there will be a solid baseline for all the
        translations.
4.  That's it

### Creating a Language Specific OWASP Project

If you have decided to start a formal project to host all the
translations to your native/desired language, here is what you have to
do.

1.  Follow the [How to Start an OWASP
    Project](How_to_Start_an_OWASP_Project "wikilink") page
    instructions, we suggest you call the project as the language not
    the country, e.g. OWASP-Spanish not OWASP-Spain, as languages use to
    spread across more than just one country.
2.  Create a new translation guidelines (for documents, pages and tools)
    based on the
    [\#General_Translation_Guidelines](#General_Translation_Guidelines "wikilink")
    below. It should include all the knowledge needed to make a quality
    translation in your native languages. Make sure to provide the
    necessary resources to at least avoid common pitfalls like false
    cognates and similar.
3.  Link your language specific project to this project, add a reference
    in "Related Projects" section at top template of this page
4.  Ask OWASP Wiki Admin (Larry Casey in this case) to enable your
    language in the Wiki Site, in case is not available in the languages
    list.
5.  OWASP is open and and you are free to modify or add new content to
    OWASP Materials, however it is always recommendable to contact
    project leaders and let them know on your intentions before you
    start a translation effort, at least as a courtesy.
6.  Update this page. Please feel free to modify this page, or add new
    pages if required, for your specific language. But make the content
    generic to the language family of your language as the idea of this
    project is to be used as a framework to develop language specific
    information.

**Remember Language projects could be more than just translating, the
idea is that knowledge in your native language could also be brought to
English speaking people, so think on the project as a link between both
languages.**

### General Translation Guidelines

Usually a document translation involves several people in order to
facilitate the translation it is necessary to provide general guidelines
for the translation. First of all, we strongly support language
neutrality, this is especially important when the language is spoken in
many different countries or regions.

Translation guidelines should include the following information:

  - Glossaries for the target language,
  - Basic orthography rules
  - Basic grammar rules
  - English-Target Language dictionary.
  - Enumeration and examples of special cases, for example use of
    dashes, quotes, etc.
  - False cognates
  - Remind the translation must remain loyal to the original text, do
    not add content to the document (at least on this stage)+
  - Recommendation to avoid slang language
  - Policy for using automated tools
  - Rules to handle terms that cannot be translated.
  - Recommend to run Spell and Grammar check
  - Examples to the rules described
  - Include a peer review strategy
  - Supportive readings and links

\+ Although the objective of the project is to enable people speaking
foreign languages to learn from OWASP and enrich OWASP documentation.
This process must be done in separated stages, initially it is desirable
to have a loyal version of the official release.

We strongly suggest you ask for help of an experienced person to give
the document a final look before it is published to OWASP site.

### Organization

The first thing is to have a good communication and coordination
strategy, we propose the following organization for a translation
effort:

#### Roles

Although OWASP is an open project, minimum skills should be procured to
ensure the translation has good quality and takes just the needed amount
of time. Believe me, you won’t like to fix dozens of small mistakes for
common computer world terms just because the translator is a totally
outside the computer world with null knowledge on what is a hard
disk :).

The proposed skills are:

  - **Translator(s)**
      - Basic computer related knowledge.
      - Good English skills
      - Fluent in foreign language
      - Working knowledge in application security skills
  - **Editor(s)**
      - Strong computer related knowledge
      - Strong English skills
      - Strong skills in foreign language, participation in translation
        project of other open source projects is a plus.
      - Strong knowledge in application security skills
  - **Translation leader.** Person in charge of coordinate the
    translation effort. There are no special requirements, just the
    ability to manage a team of people and deliver on proposed time.

### Translating Documents

This is the first release of the section, expect changed during the
following weeks as we are requesting feedback from people involved in
previous translations of OWASP documents, if you know one of these
people please ask them to contact [me](mailto:johnccr@yahoo.com)

#### Setup

Translation Project leader and/or translation leader should create set
of basic guidelines for translation as defined in
[\#General_Translation_Guidelines](#General_Translation_Guidelines "wikilink")
section If the translation is going to be on a MS Word document is
highly recommended to create a document template with web established
styles for headers, so consolidating the document is easier The
translation leader will distribute the work and set up tentative due
dates for the sections based on the translators workload.

#### While Translating

It is suggested that once the distributed sections are ready, they are
sent to the distribution list and the editor is notified

#### Before Delivering

In parallel to translation or after everyone has finished, the editor
(or the person designated by the editor) will do the following actions

  - Consolidate the whole document
  - Do spelling and grammar check
  - Ensure document "harmony". This is:
      - make sure the same terms are using across the document
      - topics sequence is natural.
      - Font type, size and style are the same for the same types of
        text.
  - Add the official cover page translated to the foreign language
    (OWASP logo, title and trademark information)
  - Add GNU license (all the OWASP work is done under this license so
    translation work should also be GNU)
  - Add OWASP internationalization project and the specific translation
    project explanation and references to let readers know where they go
    in case of interest in the translation project. Add this page after
    cover page.
  - Add translation credit for project leader, editor and translators
    just after the author name.
  - Convert the document to PDF format for portability, but also let the
    editable version available to the public.

Finally If there is a translation project, you can send the document to
the project leader for its publication in the translation project and in
the original project page.

### Translating OWASP pages

To make more clear the process of creating a translated page, consider
the following assumptions. Our example foreign language code is “es” for
Spanish and the page we want to translate is called “TranslationTest”.
(Actually this page is there for you to use it ans tes for translation
support of the portal on your specific language). So let’s start

You should first classify the page to translate as a main page (project
description page, project content page) or support page (roadmap, links,
quotes, etc)

#### For Main Pages (project pages only)

1.  Add a new page called “PruebaTraduccion” (“Translation Test” in
    Spanish)
2.  At the beginning of the page add the TranslatedPageHeader template
    by adding *{{TranslatedPageHeader}}*
3.  At the end of the page add the TranslationInProgress template by
    adding *{{TranslationInProgress}}* in page code.
4.  Go to “TranslationTest” page and click on “View Source” tab.
5.  Copy the source code and start translating it locally. Then paste it
    in “PruebaTraduccion” page as you progress.
6.  If there is links to pages that are not translated, let the reader
    know by adding a “(In English only)” note after the link.
7.  Just before the end of the page, add a recognition section for the
    people that helped in the translation. Make sure to mention their
    role in the translation, their full name and Security
    certifications, refain to mention companies unless they are OWASP
    members or you have permission from OWASP Board to mention them.
8.  Once you are done remove the TranslationInProgress template in
    “PruebaTraduccion” page.
9.  Add a new sub-page for “TranslationTest” using your language code.
    This is, for Spanish, you should create a sub-page called
    “TranslationTest/es”.
10. In “TranslationTest/es” page just enter the following redirect
    statement *\#REDIRECT \[\[PruebaTraduccion|PruebaTraduccion\]\]*

#### For Support Pages

For support pages, you do not need to add a third page in the foreign
language (like PruebaTraduccion in previous example). Rather, you add
the translated content directly to the “TranslationTest/es” page. Adding
the *TranslatedPageHeader* is also not necessary.

#### Translating Links

Similar to templates, links are enclosed in special characters, in this
case square braces. There are 2 types of links, external links will look
like this

`[http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Templates here]`

And should be translated as Links like this

`[http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Templates aqui]`

Internal links, or links that point to pages in the OWASP site will look
like this

`[[OWASP_WebGoat_Project_Roadmap|Roadmap]] `

And should be translated to

`[[OWASP_WebGoat_Project_Roadmap|Plan de trabajo]] `

For links without the second part (the one after the pipe character)
just add it, **Avoid changing the content if this is case otherwise you
will break the link or link to a non existent page**.



#### Translating Templates

Templates are an special type of pages that can be included as part of
regular pages contents, you can learn more about them
[here](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Templates), you can identify
it in wiki code as text enclosed in curly braces like the following:

`{{OWASP Book`
`|1416452}}`

To access wiki code of the template above you have to go to
<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Template:MainLink>. Templates do not
support "/es" for translations as regular pages, instead we need to use
special tags to support multiple languages in the same page. So edit the
template code and change it from:

`[[{{{1}}}|Main<br>({{{1}}})]]`

To

`  `
`<IfLanguage Is="en">`
`[[{{{1}}}|Main<br>({{{1}}})]]`
`</IfLanguage>`
`<IfLanguage Is="es">`
`[[{{{1}}}|Principal<br>({{{1}}})]]`
`</IfLanguage>`

The previous code displays the text in the first *IfLanguage* tag to
people with browsers in English and the second to people with browsers
in Spanish language.

That is it. Now visitors with browsers configured in your foreign
language will be automatically redirected to the page in that language.

### Tracking Changes in Pages

In order to track changes of pages for a translation project to keep
translated pages up to date, you have to track changes doing the
following:

1.  Login to OWASP Portal (register if you haven't, its free\!)
2.  Go to the page you want to track and click on the "watch" tab. After
    that you will be able to see all the change to that page at the
    [Watchlist special page](Special:Watchlist "wikilink").
3.  You can always go back to the [Watchlist special
    page](Special:Watchlist "wikilink") by clicking on [Special
    Pages](Special:Specialpages "wikilink") link at the left bottom of
    the site. and then click on the [Watchlist special
    page](Special:Watchlist "wikilink").

There is a drawback, you will have to click the watch tab for every
single page you want to track. This simple process will be enough to
keep track of pages updates.

You can find more information on here:
<http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Tracking_changes>

### Translating OWASP Software

Here you can find a series of basic guidelines document to help you make
your OWASP tool project internationalizable.

The guidelines are available for:

  - [Java](OWASP_Internationalization_Java_Software "wikilink")

### Active Translation Projects

  - [Spanish](OWASP_Spanish "wikilink")

### Future Plans

  - Have people that help us ot enhance the guidelines and develop
    recommendations for arabic, slavic(Russian, Polish), ideographic
    (Chinese), Hindi and Japaneese (among others).

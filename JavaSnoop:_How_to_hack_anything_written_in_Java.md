\== The presentation ==

![Owasp_logo_normal.jpg](Owasp_logo_normal.jpg
"Owasp_logo_normal.jpg")Anybody who has assessed anything with a thick
Java client has probably been frustrated beyond belief and unhappy with
their coverage, but that's only because this tool hasn't been released
yet. We created a tool that allows you to easily jump into any JVM on
your machine, and tamper with class bytecode, method parameters, return
values - without requiring any pesky original source code, or the most
elusive artifact - skill\!

What happens when that applet you want to hack uses serialized objects
over a custom encryption scheme, and you have 40 hours to break it?
Theoretically, you know that's not good enough, but who cares about
"theoretically"? JavaSnoop will allow you to intercept calls inside the
JVM for tampering with data before it gets to the network, while its
still in object form\! What happens when that fancy desktop tool you
have has an expired license? JavaSnoop will allow you to make that
isLicensed() check return the value you want, instead of the value you
didn't pay for.

All this in a nice, portable GUI tool. I can't wait to enable you\!

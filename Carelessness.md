## Description

Carelessness or Negligence is lack of concern about the consequences of
an action. The negligence may be foreseeable or a unintentional, but in
both cases a person can be held responsible for any consequences of such
negligence. Only humans can be negligent and this can cause damage to an
organization's business systems, facilities, or personnel.

## Risk Factors

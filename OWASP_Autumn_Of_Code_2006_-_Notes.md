If you want to help with this project, here are some to-dos:

## Current Marketing Strategy

  - Link this OAC page from the main Owasp.Org website
  - Make a little banner add which can be inserted in the main Owasp.Org
    website (and on websites that want to help)
  - Send an email to all OWASP email subscribers
  - Send an email to key mailing lists (webappsec, sc-l, etc...)
  - Write Press Release and distribute it ([OWASP Autumn Of Code 2006 :
    Press
    Release](OWASP_Autumn_Of_Code_2006_:_Press_Release "wikilink"))
  - Create several articles and get them published (also try to get
    interviews by respected IT media)
  - Do a 'Sponsorship' push, where current members (and prospective
    members) are contacted to see if they want to sponsor specific
    projects.
  - Contact the OWASP chapters directly and ask them to publicize OAC at
    their local meetings

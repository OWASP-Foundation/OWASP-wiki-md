# Front Range OWASP Conference 2009 (SNOWFROC) Call for Presentations

On March 5th 2009, OWASP will hold its second ever "Front Range OWASP
Conference (FROC)" in Denver, Colorado.

The Conference consists of a single day of Application Security sessions
with 2 different tracks.

In 2008, we attracted a packed venue with our great AppSec speakers, and
we hope to achieve the same again in 2009. This year we organized the
conference to occur during the peak of the Colorado ski season, so that
speakers can head up to the nearby mountains after the conference to
enjoy some of the legendary snow .

We are seeking presentations on any of the following topics:

`   * Web Services and Application Security`
`   * Common Application related Threats and Risks`
`   * Business Risks with Application Security`
`   * "Cloud" Security`
`   * Vulnerability Research in Application Security`
`   * Web Application Penetration Testing`
`   * OWASP Tools and Projects`
`   * Secure Coding Practices`
`   * Technology specific presentations on security such as AJAX, XML, etc.`
`   * Anything else relating to OWASP and Application Security.`

The official closing date for receiving a synopsis of the presentation
is 6 February 2009, with announcements on selected candidates to be
provided by 13 February 2009. Complete presentations must be submitted
by 27 February 2009.

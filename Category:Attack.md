This category is for tagging common types of application security
attacks.

## What is an attack?

Attacks are the techniques that attackers use to exploit the
vulnerabilities in applications. Attacks are often confused with
vulnerabilities, so please try to be sure that the attack you are
describing is something that an attacker would do, rather than a
weakness in an application.

All attack articles should follow the [Attack
template](Attack_template "wikilink").

## Examples:

  - Brute Force: Is an exhaustive attack that works by testing every
    possible value of a parameter (password, file name, etc.)
    [Brute_force_attack](:Brute_force_attack "wikilink")
  - Cache Poisoning: Is an attack that seeks to introduce false or
    malicious data into a web cache, normally via HTTP Response
    Splitting. [Cache_Poisoning](:Cache_Poisoning "wikilink")
  - DNS Poisoning: Is an attack that seeks to introduce false DNS
    address information into the cache of a DNS server, where it will be
    served to other users enabling a variety of attacks. (e.g.,
    Phishing)

Note: many of the items marked vulnerabilities and other places are
really attacks. Some of the more obvious are:

  - [Resource exhaustion](Resource_exhaustion "wikilink")
  - [Reflection injection](Reflection_injection "wikilink")
  - [Reflection attack in an auth
    protocol](Reflection_attack_in_an_auth_protocol "wikilink")

## Overview

Cross site scripting (XSS) continues to show up on the as a top
vulnerability every year. While very pervasive and dangerous, this
vulnerability is possible to mitigate with reasonable developer effort.
This page is dedicated to helping mitigate this vulnerability in regards
to the Microsoft .NET Framework.

## Attack Vectors

The primary XSS attack vectors are:

  - Reflected XSS
  - Persistent XSS

Please see [Cross-site Scripting
(XSS)](Cross-site_Scripting_\(XSS\)#Stored_and_Reflected_XSS_Attacks "wikilink")
for more detail regarding reflected and persistent XSS attacks.

## Options

  - Microsoft AntiXSS Library
      - Available in ASP.NET 4.5 in the System.Web.Security.AntiXss
        namespace
      - Available prior to ASP.NET 4.5 via NuGet:
        (https://www.nuget.org/packages/AntiXSS/) Install-Package
        AntiXSS (currently v4.2.1 as of 4/12/2014)
          - Using Microsoft AntiXSS as the default encoder in ASP.NET
            instructions (Phil Haack has a good link on this already:
            <http://haacked.com/archive/2010/04/06/using-antixss-as-the-default-encoder-for-asp-net.aspx/>)
  - Microsoft Web Protection Library (WPL) - via
    <http://wpl.codeplex.com/workitem/17246>
      - there seem to be known issues with this library:
        <http://blog.securityps.com/2012/12/alternatives-to-microsofts-wpl-sanitizer.html>
  - OWASP Anti-Samy Library
    (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_AntiSamy_Project_.NET)
      - Not recently maintained (good option for to get it up to date
        and relevant\!\!\!)
  - HtmlSanitizer
      - An open-source .Net library.
      - The HTML is cleaned with a white list approach.
      - All allowed tags and attributes can be configured.
      - The library is unit tested with the [OWASP XSS Filter Evasion
        Cheat
        Sheet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_Filter_Evasion_Cheat_Sheet)
      - <https://github.com/mganss/HtmlSanitizer>

  - TODO add more references here -- Troy Hunt's material is excellent -
    I'm sure more people in the world have content which would be
    valuable here to reference...

## TODO

### Now

  - Look at the Microsoft implementations
  - See what work has already been done in the OWASP space for XSS
  - See what other work has been done for XSS (both .NET and other
    technology stacks)
  - Illustrate vulnerabilities and how to mitigate them (e.g.
    WebGoat.NET)
  - See if we can get the OWASP Anti-Samy project back into relevance

### Future

  - Dream big here\!

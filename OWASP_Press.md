<td><h2 id="the_owasp_press_project">The OWASP Press Project</h2>
<p>The OWASP press project is proposal that allows community authoring and edditing with just in time publishing.</p>
<p>Community authoring is fraught with challenges. Word documents with revisions on eventually crash, and so people eventually take to naming conventions to manage the versions. Additionally, there is only one canonical master; this makes authoring and editing in parallel impossible; and merging the resulting versions is an enormous time sink in and of itself. This only gets worse the larger the book is and the more authors that are involved.</p>
<p>Additionally, I have long desired a bookshelf full of OWASP books; and indeed other people have as well. As we have an OWASP Lulu store. The problem with this model however is that the publishing is remains oriented around the 'dead-tree publishing' workflow. Where books are written to a deadline and 'released' to the editors, and finally sent to the printers for publishing and distribution. And by the time the documents make it to publication they are already out of date.</p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>OWASP has long provided some of the very best documentation on the web for Application Security. Among the awesome documentation resources are projects like OWASP Cheatsheets, The OWASP Development Guide, OWASP Testing Guide, OWASP AppSensor and OWASP SAMM.</p>
<p>These community documentation projects are living, collaborative works and so they present a special challenge to the 'dead-tree publishing' workflow. Additionally, I have the books I love most on my Kindle not a physical bookshelf, who wants to lug a dead-tree when you can haul around a library?</p>
<p>The answer was obviously just-in-time publishing, after all isn't this what a wiki is? Where anybody from the OWASP community could update a text and the update be instantly available? While wiki technology really excels at on-line living documentation and knowledge management; wiki's have failed to succeed at general purpose publishing platforms.</p>
<p>I have spent the last month exploring ways to instantiate a just-in-time open publishing workflow to produce digital and dead-tree editions of the OWASP documentation projects.</p>
<p>Every avenue I turned down, I would inevitably run into numerous issues attempting to create a workflow. While, I was able to get some ideas to work successfully, I was unsatisfied, as the complexity required would have created a participation barrier to entry.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I was not alone in my thinking and I discovered last week that the people at Leanpub had solved exactly these issues that needed to be overcome to make this a reality.</p>

# Getting Started

## Leanpub

[Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/) is a lean workflow applied to
documentation. Publishing is indeed lean; as in [Toyota
lean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing); in fact it is
just-in-time like the [Qin
Dynasty's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qin_Dynasty) [terra cotta
warriors](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/chinese-terra-cotta-warriors-had-real-and-very-carefully-made-weapons/2012/11/26/999b9cb4-2840-11e2-b4e0-346287b7e56c_print.html)\!
In fact they have written a very interesting
[manifesto](https://leanpub.com/manifesto) about the future of
publishing that I found to be very insightful and well researched. I
highly recommend reading it if you are interested in such things.

While Leanpub is full of coolness for
[authors](https://leanpub.com/help/author_faq), I want to talk about how
it works. Leanpub works via [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) and
plain-text [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
files.

After joining the site, you create a book by clicking a 'Create a lean
pub book now' link; which takes you to a page that asks for the book
title and a URL; and you submit the form with a 'create my book' button.
Leanpub then publishes a manuscript folder to dropbox and shares it with
you, and sets up a storefront for the book at the url you specified.

The manuscript is written in markdown\[1\], However, since markdown is a
simple markup format it doesn't have any file inclusion features, so
everything is expected to be in a single file. This is a problem because
it is very difficult for many authors to make changes to a single file,
and also because it is simply nicer to separate out ideas that belong
together into chapters.

This is one of the issues I ran into when attempting to build this for
OWASP myself. I tried using makefiles and
[GPP](http://en.nothingisreal.com/wiki/GPP) to overcome this limitation
of 'everything in a single file.'

Leanpub's answer is a simple textile called book.txt that simply lists
the files in the order they are to be include as such:

    about-the-book.md
    acknowledgments.md
    introduction.md
    chapter-01.md
    chapter-02.md
    chapter-03.md
    appendix-01.md
    appendix-02.md

And with that the problem is solved, simply and elegantly. And unlike my
attempts, it solves it without having to acquire and compile software to
participate in authoring. Keeping the barrier to participation very low.

Dropbox's killer feature is
[sharing](https://www.dropbox.com/help/category/Sharing). However, while
sharing is awesome; it is best used for distribution of information that
doesn't change often. Additionally, it while dropbox keeps a complete
history of files; dropbox doesn't provide the granularity of history
that a good version control system does. This makes sense because
sharing is about distribution of mostly 'static' content.

However, what is needed for massive collaboration, is good distributed
version control software which is built with changes in mind.
Particularly where you can have an infinite number of authors. You need
something that has merging of conflicts built into its DNA. The [coup
d'état](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d%27%C3%A9tat) of
[distributed version control
systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_revision_control) is
Linus Torvald's [git](http://git-scm.com/) project. And the best place
to host a public git repository is arguably
[github](https://github.com/).

## Github

Git is an amazing tool for [community
collaboration](http://scriptogr.am/dennis-groves/post/open-source-democracy)
and change management so the final step is putting the shared dropbox
under git version control and pushing the repository to github.
Incidentally, OWASP has a [github repositoryy](https://github.com/owasp)
and members of the community should be encouraged to use it.

In this example the dropbox and the github fork are on the same machine,
However, they could easily be different machines; and in practice they
will be as each author will have the github fork and only the project
leader will have the dropbox.

To start an OWASP Publication, with the browser of your choice:

1.  Create a book at lean pub. (in this example AppSensor)
2.  Create a new repo at github. (In this example AppSensor-Handbook)

In a terminal:

1.  cd \~/dropbox/AppSensor
2.  git init
3.  git remote add origin
    <https://github.com/OWASP/AppSensor-Handbook.git>
4.  git push -u origin master

Everything is now ready for mass collaboration and realtime
publication\! In order for Authors to participate in the publication
process:

1.  Download your favorite github.com client for
    [mac](mac.github.com "wikilink") or
    [windows](windows.github.com "wikilink") (or use the command line if
    your are so inclined).
2.  Clone the github.com repository.
3.  Fork your own branch.
4.  Edit the manuscript.
5.  push the changes.

Once the authors are done making changes or through the use of a [git
branching
model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). The
project lead who has the dropbox computer will need to goto the dropbox
folder and 'git -pull' the changes from authors at github. This will
automatically syncs the leanpub website which shares the dropbox folder.
The project owner can then publish the updates by navigating to the
leanpub website and clicking the 'create a preview of my book' on
actions tab.

While I appreciate that this is somewhat manual, github has service
hook's that could be used to automate this workflow completely. I am
currently exploring the best way to do this. If the dropbox is hosted
remotely as well then the ['git
-pull'](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/other/the-perfect-workflow-with-git-github-and-ssh/)
can be automated. This need to be followed by a publish request with
leanpub; and while it has some authorisation tokens and oner
'anti-automation' cookies; it would be trivial for most of the OWASP
community to issue the post request to leanpub in an automated way.

# Editing

[CriticMarkup](http://criticmarkup.com) is a way for authors and editors
to track changes to documents in plain text. As with
[Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), small groups of
distinctive characters allow you to highlight insertions, deletions,
substitutions and comments, all without the overhead of heavy,
proprietary office suites.

**The Three Laws**

1.  Critic Markup shall be human readable. A human with a simple text
    editor can easily read and comprehend any text containing Critic
    Markup.
2.  Critic Markup shall be computer readable except where it conflicts
    with rule 1. Markup syntax should be easily parsed with simple
    regular expressions to support a wide variety of implementations.
3.  Critic Markup shall be compatible with existing markup syntax for
    Markdown, MultiMarkdown and HTML except where it conflicts with
    rules one or two. Many users of plain text write in combinations of
    Markdown and HTML. Critic Markup should work alongside that syntax.

**The Basic Syntax**

There are five types of Critic marks:

    Addition {++ ++}
    Deletion {-- --}
    Substitution {~~ ~> ~~}
    Comment {>> <<}
    Highlight {{ }}{>> <<}

Using these {\~\~ six \~\> five \~\~} basic marks you can {++
successfully ++} copy edit in plain text. {\>\> Although modern word
processing programs can do some amazing things—adding charts, tables,
and images, applying sophisticated formatting—there’s one thing they
can’t do: Guarantee that the words I write today will be readable ten
years from now. That’s just one of the reasons I prefer to work in plain
text: It’s timeless. My grandchildren will be able to read a text file I
create today, long after anybody can remember what the heck a .dotx file
is. \<\<}

**Conclusion**

Combine this with [git version control](http://git-scm.com) and you have
a complete history of changes to your documents in plain text, including
reviewer feedback\! Now even reviewer can participate in the [OWASP
Press](http://scriptogr.am/dennis-groves/post/owasp-press).

# Road Map and Getting Involved

<span style="color:#ff0000">

`   A project roadmap is the envisioned plan for the project. The purpose of the roadmap is to help others understand where the project is going. It gives the community a chance to understand the context and the vision for the goal of the project. Additionally, if a project becomes inactive, or if the project is abandoned, a roadmap can help ensure a project can be adopted and continued under new leadership.`

</span> 

<span style="color:#ff0000">

`   Roadmaps vary in detail from a broad outline to a fully detailed project charter. Generally speaking, projects with detailed roadmaps have tended to develop into successful projects. Some details that leaders may consider placing in the roadmap include: envisioned milestones, planned feature enhancements, essential conditions, project assumptions, development timelines, etc. You are required to have at least 4 milestones for every year the project is active. `

</span>

As of October 2013, the priorities are:

  - Finish the referencing for each principle.
  - Update the Project Template.
  - Use the OWASP Press to develop a book.
  - Finish and publish the book on Lulu.

Involvement in the development and promotion of the OWASP Security
Principles Project is actively encouraged\! You do not have to be a
security expert in order to contribute. Some of the ways you can help:

  - Helping find references to some of the principles.
  - Project administration support.
  - Wiki editing support.
  - Writing support for the book.

1.  Markdown is a very cool plain-text format that can be compiled by
    tools like [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) into numerous
    outputs; including latex, mediawiki, doc, and html to name but a
    very few. Using pandoc the very same markdown text can easily be
    turned into mediawiki content for the OWASP wiki.

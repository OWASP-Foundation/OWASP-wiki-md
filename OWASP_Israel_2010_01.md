## 18:10 - 18:40 : WAFs in the Cloud

**Ofer Shezaf, Better Place**

Like any other new concept, cloud computing presents challenges in many
different areas. Since many cloud based applications are web based, Web
Application Firewalls (WAFs) is a technology that we need to adapt to
cloud computing. In the presentation we will discuss two aspects of
integrating WAFs into cloud computing: on the one hand WAF as a service,
and on the other hand how to protect a cloud based web service, with a
cloud based WAF or without it. We shall examine the pros and cons of a
cloud based WAF and look into existing WAF services such as Akamai and
Art of Defense. We shall compare them to regular WAF solutions as well
as to alternative methods for protecting cloud based services such as
virtual WAF or a host based WAF.

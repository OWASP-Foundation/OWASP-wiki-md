One of the highlights at the [OWASP AppSec Europe 2007
Conference](OWASP_AppSec_Europe_2007_-_Italy "wikilink") in Milan was
probably the first concert of the "OWASP Band" which was leaded by Dinis
Cruz. Below you'll find some impressions of the concert, next time we
need also someone who has a video camera :)

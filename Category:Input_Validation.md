## Description

Input validation refers to the process of validating all the input to an
application before using it. Input validation is absolutely critical to
application security, and most application risks involve tainted input
at some level.

Many applications do not plan input validation, and leave it up to the
individual developers. This is a recipe for disaster, as different
developers will certainly all choose a different approach, and many will
simply leave it out in the pursuit of more interesting development.

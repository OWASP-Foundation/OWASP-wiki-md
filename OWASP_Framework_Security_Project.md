# Main

## Project Goal

The OWASP Framework Security Project focuses on understanding missing
security controls within popular frameworks, and coordinating with
developers and the framework leaders to effectively integrate the
missing security controls. This project requires the collaboration
between security experts, security minded developers, and framework
developers and leaders. The primary deliverable of this project is
source code that is accepted into frameworks. The OWASP Framework
Security Project will maintain documentation to indicate with security
controls have been accepted, and links to code and documentation at each
framework. For more information, please contact the Project leader,
Michael Coates.

## How To Help

Important - Please join the [mailing
list](https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp_framework_security_project)\!

  - **Framework Developers** - We need your help to build the security
    controls that will get accepted upstream into the framework. You
    have the best knowledge on development practices, code style, and
    knowledge of the framework to get new code accepted.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Security Professionals** - We need you to help research and
    catalog available security controls in various frameworks. Our goal
    is to produce and clear matrix of available and missing security
    controls by framework.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Framework Leaders** - Do you lead a key portion of a framework?
    Let's work together to understand the best way to get new security
    controls added.

<!-- end list -->

  - A little of both? Please help in either area\!

## Roadmap

1.  **Research** - Capture popular frameworks and status of security
    controls. See [Frameworks & Security Controls
    Tab](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Framework_Security_Project#Frameworks__26_Security_Controls).
    Please add in security controls and frameworks\!
2.  **Outreach & Development** - We need to work with framework owners
    and experienced developers to get specific security controls added
    to the framework

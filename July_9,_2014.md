  - Tobias Gondrom raises issue brought to leaders-list from Achim
      - There is a question from Achim Hoffman about user tracking
        features in our connector.
      - Dear all, why does OWASP send mails to its community which only
        contain tracking links instead to owasp.org ? Do we (OWASP) need
        to be tracked by others when visiting ourself? Why are we forced
        to use \*.vresp.com when we want to go to owasp.org? I want to
        receive the "OWASP Connector" mail, but never opted in at
        foreign sites. No offence meant according the idea that others
        (wether persons, companies or organisations) helping OWASP to do
        whatever. But this mail looks phishy (I believe it's not ;-) As
        OWASP is about bringing awareness to everyone, i.e. about
        phishing mails, social engineering, etc. how should we explain
        our audience that we don't follow our advices ourself?
        Wondering, Achim
  - Proposal method & call for comment
      - Committees 2.0 approach demonstrates this as a solid way to
        handle complex topics.
      - Recommend this approach of flushing out ideas and receiving
        comment for future complex areas (stale chapter funds, owasp
        summit, scholarship program, etc)

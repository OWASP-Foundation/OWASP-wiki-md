### Action Items from Meeting

1.  Agree on the project template for every project to use
    1.  In particular, determine what needs to be on every project page,
        globally for OWASP
    2.  Perhaps project “skeleton” page is a better term
    3.  Base the discussion on what Paulo has created - See links \# 1
        and \#2 below for examples.
2.  How to handle / divide agenda items within the committee's timeline

    2.  The goal is to redefine the action plan for 2009 setting up
        specific goals
3.  Discussions will be on the mail list for now until some issues with
    the forum are worked out
4.  Next meeting scheduled: January 6th at 10 PM GMT

### Other Issues Raised for Consideration

1.  Consider recording the Skype meetings in future
2.  Need to sort out the projects roles/responsibilities for
    1.  Project Leaders
    2.  Project Contributors
    3.  Project Reviews
    4.  Look at how others do this (Apache project, other code
        sponsorships – Google & Yahoo)
3.  How to close out the Summer of Code 2008
4.  How to handle past company sponsored projects which have been
    refreshed significantly. Examples include:

### Unofficial Meeting Agenda

(AKA Matt Tesauro's prep notes for the meeting)

\[Modified to include Pravir Chandra's late addition to the agenda
items\]

Agenda: (from OWASP.org)

To this end, the OWASP Global Projects Committee establishes the
following agenda for the 2009 calendar year.

  - **Define Metrics:** define metrics to measure OWASP Projects through
    various aspects such as quality, activity, usability, relevance,
    currentness, availability and popularity.
  - **Apply Metrics:** to all existing OWASP Projects and determine the
    status for each project
  - **Incorporate Results:** incorporate results and experiences during
    re-evaluation process to establish new categorizations for projects
  - **Create Metadata:** create a defined set of project metadata to be
    captured for all OWASP Projects to facilitate organization and
    maintenance.
  - **Capture Metadata:** capture all defined metadata for existing
    OWASP Projects
  - **Provide Repository:** Provide a standardized, managed,
    OWASP-controlled repository for all OWASP Projects to facilitate a
    consistent manner to retrieve the latest versions of OWASP projects.
  - **Create Project Kit:** Create a kit for new OWASP projects that
    includes standard graphic design elements such as OWASP logos,
    recommended color schemes, fonts, templates, etc. These elements
    should be used for both OWASP Tools and Documentation projects. In
    addition, consider creating human user interface guidelines for
    tools that use GUIs.
  - **Migrate Projects:** Migrate existing projects to the OWASP
    Repository
  - **Revamp Project Site:** the OWASP Project website to leverage the
    newly created metadata, metrics and centralized repository.
    Additionally, the OWASP Project website should allow for members of
    the OWASP community to suggest new project ideas.
  - **Rework Project page table:** Re-work the X of Code table to
    incorporate the new metrics above

<!-- end list -->

  - **Transition Process:** Provide a transition process from X of Code
    to a proper project page

<!-- end list -->

  - **Capture Metrics:** Provide a method to capture and keep the
    metrics needed for a project in a way that doesn't interfere with
    marketing that project to its target audience(s)

<!-- end list -->

  - **Template for Project Pages:** Provide some sort of skeletal
    project page which contains a mixture of required, optional and
    free-form elements so that project pages are consistent (good for
    OWASP globally) while flexible enough to serve the project's
    audience (good for that project specifically). Basically expand
    what's
    here:<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/How_to_Start_an_OWASP_Project>
  - **Documentation Project Workflow:** Research and define a workflow
    for documentation projects such that they can provide content for
    wiki, download, and printed matter in a way that minimizes effort.

Other items raised on OWASP Leaders List:

  - Use of Forums vs. Mailmain Email list
      - Skype calls vs Forum discussions vs Mailman – talk about what in
        which technology
  - OWASP definition of Open Source?
      - From Dave Wichers (Leaders list)Yes - I think the Global project
        community should help select the set oflicenses we support.I
        think Jeff might already have done this and its on the licenses
        page, butplease coordinate with him.-Dave
  - Is <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Licenses> sufficient ?  The
    text from that page is below:"All software, documentation, and other

  - New Projects
      - Is the how to start an OWASP project on the Wiki
        sufficient?https://www.owasp.org/index.php/How_to_Start_an_OWASP_Project
      - OWASP Proxy (Rogan)
  - RSS for projects (from Leaders List)
      - Mike Boberski suggested a RSS feed to track OWASP project
        globallyI would like to propose a new separate RSS feed that can
        be used to track OWASP project activity in general. Perhaps,
        tailored for a small specific set of event types, if existing
        tools supported this functionality.I would for example be
        interested in being notified using a feed when there is a new
        article for a project that I may not be monitoring closely but
        am interested in.
      - Jason Li responded: Came up at summit for Web Site Working
        Group:I've often thought the same thing and I brought this up as
        a suggestion at the recent OWASP EU Summit (see
        <https://www.owasp.org/images/8/8b/EUSummit08_OWASP_Web_Site_Working_Session_Suggestions.doc>).The
        folks overseeing the OWASP Website project are working on this
        feature
      - Matt Tesauro wonders – is this a semi-requirement for the
        starndardized repository? Should that be a consideration when we
        address that agenda item.
  - Catpure time spent metrics (from Leaders List)
      - Antonio Fontes suggested tracking time spend on projects during
        a lengthy thread on increasing memberships, the 60/40 program,
        etc:Your first challenge, at the leader level, I guess, is about
        getting people to clearly measure what is being done behind the
        scenes. When I go on the Code Review project page for example, I
        don't know how many hours were spent on it. This is something we
        all learn at school and that I experience on a daily basis at
        work: metrics make value. When I started working where I work
        now, I had to put the time/costs breakdown in the code review
        report to make people understand why the report wasn't delivered
        just 30 minutes after sending a 'CR' request to my office.When
        the OWASP gets people to understand what is 'behind' the scenes,
        donations should come right after. If they don't, I guess the
        OWASP would have to consider re-targetting its audience...
      - Matt Tesauro ponders: An interesting and probably valuable
        metric but one that is very hard to capture. I certainly didn't
        for my Live CD SoC project.
  - Asyncronous discussion request by Andrew Petukhov (time zone issues
    with Skype call)

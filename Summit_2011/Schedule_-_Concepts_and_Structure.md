# Discussion group

There is a dedicated Discussion Forum for Summit Schedule items, which
can be found here:
<https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/group/summit-2011-schedule>

# Concepts

The key objecives of the Summit Schedule are:

  - Maximize Attendees productivity (while at the Summit)
  - Attract as much talent (and key players) to the Summit as possible
  - Convince attendees to spend (at least) 3 days at the Summit (Tue,
    Wed and Thu)

### Schedules

There will be a number of different schedules that need to be created

  - **Pre-Summit Schedule** - Created/Released 4 weeks before the
    Summit, Contains what its known at the time, doesn't make ANY
    commitment (apart for very specific exceptions) on when a Track or
    Working Session will occour, defines the KEY Summit Schedule
    components (i.e. how many Large/Medium/Small Working Sessions slots
    will exist)
  - **Draft Scheadule** - Not for public consumtion schedule, used
    internally to test out the possible schedule combinations and to
    detect/address major schedule conflicts. This is where all data will
    be feed as it becomes available (attendees arrival times, attendees
    working sessions attendance preferences, attendees 'black spots',
    etc....)
  - **Final Schedule** - Released 1 or 2 days before the Summit. This is
    basically the final version of the Draft Scheadule, NOT to be
    modified during the Summit

### What needs to be known before the Final schedule is created

  - When are the attendees arriving (exact dates and times they arrive
    at the venue)
  - What working sessions will exist
  - What working sessions the attendees MUST be present (since they are
    a key participant or leader)
  - What working sessions the attendees WOULD LIKE to be present
  - Any time or date limitations/constraints
      - Ask key attendees if they have remote meetings that they
        **need** to be and will make them unavailable to participate in
        a working session (we should keep these to the minimum, but it
        will be good to take them into account)
      - Some attendees will have other Summit Related tasks (let's say
        Jim with helping out on Podcasting), so we need to take this
        into account when creating the personalized scheadules

### What can be mapped for the 'Pre-Summit Schedule'

Although it will be too soon to make any committments on when a
particular track or working session will occour, the following items can
be added to the publicly available (to be published ASAP) 'Pre-Summit
Schedule'

  - **Working Sessions slots** - marked as Large, Medium and Small (with
    a number for how many 'slots' we have on each category)
  - **'Birds of a Feather' slots** -
    <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_a_Feather_(computing>
  - **Social Events**' - see [Summit Venue
    Logistics](Summit_2011/Summit_Venue_Logistics "wikilink")
  - **Coffee, Lunch and Dinner breaks**

### How to know the attende's Working Sessions mappings

A technological solution must be found to allow the attendees to provide
their 'Working sessions mappings' (for reference, when Jim Manico was
asked to provide a quick list of Working Sessions that he felt that he
MUST go, he came up with a list of 33 Working Sessions (and those were
the Working Sessions marked with 'A' when using a ranking system of 'A'
to 'F')

Here are some ideas:

  - we could use the wiki (since every working session has its own
    page). This still needs some fine tuning, but it is something we
    have now
  - we could use other non-wiki solutions (which will need a way to
    batch import and export the working session's data)
      - OWASP current registation solution (already used to register the
        attendees and sponsorships)
      - Doddle.com
      - EventBrite
      - other conference registration solutions (for example the UK's
        DDD conference does a similar 'attendee pool' to decide which
        presentations will happen)

### Other examples of 'Flexible Schedule' conferences

There are a number of conferences that have large parts of its schedule
allocated to meetings that are only defined a couple days before (or
even at the beggining of the conference). Also, what does the schedule
looks like for those big government meetings? G20, EU Summits, Davos,
etc... Don't they also have a big element of 'dynamic sheduling'?

We should identify them and learn from their experience.

### Types of Attendees

There will be a number of different attendees at the Summit:

  - **OWASP 'Hard-core' Leaders** - will want to be involved in OWASP
    Governace issues
  - **OWASP Leaders** - will mainly be interrested in their own
    project/chapter and Working Sessions related to their
    professional/personal interrests
  - **OWASP User**
  - **new to OWASP**

For each one of these type we should:

  - have a description
  - know how many there are in each group
  - map any special considerations or activities we should be planning
    for them
  - name them\! (i.e. see if it is possible to find and name one (or
    more) individuals in each category so that it is easier to visualize
    what would be their needs, desires and requirements)

### Types of Track

  - Keynote: one to many presentation, 15m slot, to be used very
    selectively, should be done by industry leaders and focused on 'big
    picture' or 'motivational' items
  - Large Working Session: few to many type of session, 50+ attendees
  - Medium Working Session: many to many type of session, 20+ attendees
  - Small Working Session: many to many type of session, 5+ attendees

### Lessons Learned from the Summit 2008

The [2008 Summit](OWASP_EU_Summit_2008 "wikilink") also had 'dynamic
schedule' that was created a couple days before the actual event. Here
are the lessons learned:

  - it is possible to create a working schedule a couple days before
    (not to say that this time around (2011 Summit) we should only
    create it a couple days before, just that it should be published a
    couple day(s) before)
  - there are a number of critical pieces of information required to
    create a really effective schedule that are only known (or
    finalized) in the last couple days/week
  - New ideas for Working Sessions will appear when attendees focus on
    the Summit (which last time only happened when they got there, and
    this time around we have been doing this from mid December)
  - creating a personalized schedule for each attendee is CRITICAL, it
    makes a big difference for attendees and it keeps the schedule team
    focused
  - there a massive perception problem with 'schedule changes' where
    proportionally small changes create the impression in the attendees
    that the 'schedule is chaotic'. Although in 2008 there was a number
    of complains about schedule changes, the actual number of changes
    was very small (when compared to the size of the schedule), so this
    time around we should have the objective to have NO (i.e. zero)
    schedule changes after Monday 1pm (i.e. 18h before the Summit
    starts)
  - Don't start the main sessions and keynotes at 9:00am. Last time we
    had to push the schedule 30m forward since it would had not been
    fair to the owasp leaders that worked so hard on their projects and
    only had 50% of the Summit attendees there (this time around we
    should put Smaller working sessions starting at 9:00am so that if
    people miss that session they are shooting themselves in the foot
  - Work lunches worked quite well (not to say that we should put that
    as part of the schedule, but the attendees are so passionate on the
    Working sessions they are involved in, that they still want to
    continue the conversation over lunch :) )
  - 'Beer/wine delivery' at 4pm was a massive success. What happened was
    that at 4pm a hotel crew (plus the Summit Staff) would appear in the
    main Working session rooms with a massive bucket of cold beers and
    wines, which was then distributed to the atteendees (we could take
    this into account and book the more 'controversial' Working Session
    to after 4pm)
  - We need to provide dinner and beer to all attendees (this was
    something that we were not counting of doing in 2008, but it proved
    completely impractical (and expensive for the attendees) NOT to do
    it. Since we used the vilas, it actually turned out great, since the
    Working Sessions conversations continued over dinner and night
  - Provided enough food and drinks, the attendees will stay talking
    about OWASP on the villas until 1am (if not more). And most (with
    some exceptions) did turn up on time for the morning sessions :)

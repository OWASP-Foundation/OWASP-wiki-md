<p><code>   The OWASP Virtual Crime Scene and Security Incident Education ProjecT will create an accessible, configurable, incident scene simulation for digital forensic and cyber security incident training within an e-learning framework.</code></p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>The OWASP Virtual Crime Scene and Security Incident Education Project will develop and evaluate pedagogic practice, catering for the needs of a diverse student base drawn from HEI, cyber security, forensic and crime enforcement professionals whilst providing a unrivaled gameification experience.</p>
<p>Scenarios, interactive objects and student transcripts will be accessed via a web interface to allow tutors to configure crime/incident scenes and provide feedback.</p>
<p>The project will be hosted on a cloud computing platform where participants can make contributions, share applications, use and evaluate resources; allowing wide community engagement with minimal investment in infrastructure.</p>

# FAQs

## How can I participate in your project?

All you have to do is make the Project Leader's aware of your available
time to contribute to the project. It is also important to let the
Leader's know how you would like to contribute and pitch in to help the
project meet it's goals and milestones. There are many different ways
you can contribute to an OWASP Project, but communication with the leads
is key.

## If I am not a programmer can I participate in your project?

Yes, you can certainly participate in the project if you are not a
programmer or technical. The project needs different skills and
expertise and different times during its development. Currently, we are
looking for researchers, writers, graphic designers, and a project
administrator.

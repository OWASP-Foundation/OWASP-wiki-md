DARPA Goes Agile with Cyber Fast Track This Research Announcement (RA)
seeks to revolutionize cyber technologies by promoting non-traditional
technical opportunities. The Cyber Fast Track (CFT) program will engage
numerous cyber related efforts across the spectrum of computer and
network operations (CNO) to demonstrate that cyber efforts can be
accomplished rapidly and cost effectively. This effort intends to extend
the existing performer base to include non-standard, cutting edge
organizations and individuals throughout the cyber community, thereby
strengthening the Department of Defenseâ€™s (DoD) Cyber Security
capabilities. One goal of this program is to demonstrate the ability for
cyber projects to be performed at an asymmetric advantage in time, cost,
and contribution of the efforts in comparison to more traditional
applied research areas. This will apply to both performance of
individual efforts and to the contracting required to engage performers
in said efforts.

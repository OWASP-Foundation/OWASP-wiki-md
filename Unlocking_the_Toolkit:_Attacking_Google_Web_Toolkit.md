\== The presentation ==

![Ron_Gutierrez.jpg](Ron_Gutierrez.jpg "Ron_Gutierrez.jpg")The Google
Web Toolkit (GWT) provides developers with a framework to easily create
Rich Internet Applications that use AJAX. The beauty of GWT lies in the
ability to write client side components in Java that get automatically
compiled into optimized browser Javascript. Once deployed, this client
side code has the ability to perform remote procedure calls to all
implemented GWT RPC methods.

From an attacker’s perspective, GWT introduces several problems. Most
notably, GWT RPC request use a custom serialization protocol which
renders all common web application scanners useless for testing.
Additionally, GWT client side code is heavily optimized and obfuscated
making reverse engineering difficult. In short, these problems have
historically made testing GWT applications a tedious and manual
process…until now.

This presentation will discuss a collection of tools and techniques that
can be used to efficiently perform GWT applications security
assessments. The talk will include live demonstrations of how to easily:

  - Unlock features within the applications user interface
  - Parse GWT RPC request payloads
  - Identify application parameters worthy of fuzzing
  - Use custom and/or existing tools, such as Burp Intruder, to fuzz GWT
    parameters
  - Navigate obfuscated GWT Javascript to enumerate RPC services and
    methods
  - Quickly create a GWT client to craft custom GWT RPC requests
  - Bypassing GWT's Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection

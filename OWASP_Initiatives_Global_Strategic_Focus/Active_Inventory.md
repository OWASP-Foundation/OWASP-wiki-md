# Overview

OWASP recognizes the extraordinary contribution of our global community
by engaging them to provide input in seven areas of strategic focus.
Within each of these defined areas, there are opportunities to
contribute and participate. As with everything in OWASP, these
discussions and decisions are open to everyone. This page contains the
list of active initiatives.

## Needs Assessment Report

We now have the results of the Needs Assessment done by Sooryen
(https://www.owasp.org/images/b/b2/OWASP_Needs_Assessment_Report.pdf).

The main takeaways of the report were:

  - Clean up our navigation and content strategy to increase usability
    and search capability.
  - Create a cleaner front page and select landing pages (such as the
    main Projects Page) so that people coming to our site can clearly
    figure out their next steps.
  - Improve the wiki aspect of our site so that it is easier to use.
  - Better integrate back end systems and communication.
  - Create a distinction between business/organization information and
    App Sec information.

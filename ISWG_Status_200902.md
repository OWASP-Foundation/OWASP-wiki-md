The goals of January/February included:

  - Finalizing the Web Application Framework Security Matrix.
  - Reaching out to Struts and Spring teams
  - Turning the Open Letter to Browsers over to committee

The framework security matrix is near complete. We have been talking
with organizations listed in the document in order to make sure the
information is as accurate as possible. OWASP continues its outreach
towards Struts and Spring teams with no useful response. The Open Letter
to Browsers has been turned over to the appropriate committee. The
information in this document is becoming outdated and may have to be
scrapped without re-testing.

The goals of March-April include:

  - Publishing the Open Letter to Browsers
  - Finish and publish the Web Application Framework Security Matrix
  - Begin work on Struts2 security gap analysis

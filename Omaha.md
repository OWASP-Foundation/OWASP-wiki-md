and easy setup. We’ll cover everything to look for in your personal
assessments.

**Presenter**: SWAP Leadership Team
**Description**: The Software Assurance Marketplace (SWAMP) is an open
initiative that brings together goals for advancing the quality and
adoption rate of security software tools, lowering thresholds for use,
and making their output easier to interpret, by creating a repository of
tools and and resources for all. During this chapter meeting we will be
providing an introduction of SWAMP by its leaders via live WebEx,
followed by a discussion about the marketplace and how we could all
benefit.

From the SWAMP website: "Researchers who develop new software assurance
tools and methodologies will use the repositories and
cyberinfrastructure offered by the marketplace to improve their
technologies and tools, while software developers and adopters will use
the same services to hunt for vulnerabilities in their software.
Educators will use these services to offer hands-on experience in
software assurance techniques to their students."

Pacific Street Campus, 1110 S. 67th Street, Omaha, NE 68182, Room 279.

**Presenter**: Zac Fowler, UNO's College of Information Science and
Technology
**Description**: As a web developer, jumping over to building for mobile
platforms like Android and iOS is a very attractive option. The worlds
aren't all that far apart form each other. You may have tried it
yourself. What are the security implications that you should think
about, jumping over from a web-based world to a native platform for the
first time? Join Zac Fowler as he walks through his experience building
an Android app, then applies the OWASP Mobile Top Ten and feedback from
experienced Breakers to the project. Zac will go over common app use
cases such as local storage and API communication, pitfalls he found, as
well as remediations for first-timers. To close, he will share how the
steps he used can be applied to (almost) any project, and how OWASP
plays a role in incrementally improving the way you approach security.

Zac Fowler is a developer and project manager at UNO's College of

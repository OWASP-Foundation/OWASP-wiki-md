\== The presentation ==

![Brandon_Sterne.jpg](Brandon_Sterne.jpg "Brandon_Sterne.jpg")The Web
faces a host of well-known but persistent threats: XSS, CSRF, MITM,
Phishing, Clickjacking, etc. Developers are aware of the threats and
mitigation strategies but the rates that the bugs are introduced and
discovered in websites remains stable. Mozilla believes declarative
security mechanisms hold promise for reliable attack mitigation.

## TBD

Brandon Sterne is the Security Program Manager at Mozilla Corporation
where he helps drive Firefox security updates and designs and implements
browser features to improve client and Web security.

This is an automated threat. To view all automated threats, please see
the [Automated Threat Category](:Category:Automated_Threat "wikilink")
page. The OWASP Automated Threat Handbook - Wed Applications
([pdf](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Automated-threat-handbook.pdf),
print), an output of the [OWASP Automated Threats to Web Applications
Project](OWASP_Automated_Threats_to_Web_Applications "wikilink"),
provides a fuller guide to each threat, detection methods and
countermeasures. The [threat identification

helps to correctly identify the automated threat.

## Definition

OAT-008

### Indicative Diagram

"OAT-008_Credential_Stuffing.png")

### Description

Lists of authentication credentials stolen from elsewhere are tested
against the applicationâ€™s authentication mechanisms to identify whether
users have re-used the same login credentials. The stolen usernames
(often email addresses) and password pairs could have been sourced
directly from another application by the attacker, purchased in a
criminal marketplace, or obtained from publicly available breach data
dumps.

Unlike [OAT-007 Credential
Cracking](OAT-007_Credential_Cracking "wikilink"), Credential Stuffing
does not involve any brute-forcing or guessing of values; instead
credentials used in other applications are being tested for validity.

### Other Names and Examples

Account checker attack; Account checking; Account takeover; Account
takeover attack; Login Stuffing; Password list attack; Password re-use;
Stolen credentials; Use of stolen credentials

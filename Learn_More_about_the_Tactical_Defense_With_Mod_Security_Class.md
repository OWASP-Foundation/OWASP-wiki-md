**Abstract:** While application flaws should ideally be fixed in the
source code, this is often not a feasible task for various reasons. Web
application firewalls are often deployed as an additional layer of
security that can monitor, detect and prevent attacks before they reach
the web application. ModSecurity, an extremely popular open source web
application firewall, is often used to help protect web applications
against known and unknown vulnerabilities alike.

This two-day boot-camp training is designed for people who want to
quickly learn how to configure and deploy ModSecurity in the most
effective manner possible. The course will cover topics such as the
powerful ModSecurity rules language, extending functionality via the
embedded Lua engine and managing suspicious events via AuditConsole.
Documented hands-on labs help students understand the inner workings of
ModSecurity and how to deploy ModSecurity securely. By leveraging the
flexibility within ModSecurity, attendees will be able to write
effective rules to mitigate complex web vulnerabilities. The bootcamp

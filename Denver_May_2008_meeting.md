### Topic: Cross Site Scripting, Exploits and Defenses

For a long time, the impact of XSS vulnerabilities has been grossly
underestimated. Recent compromises, such as the pro-Hillary
[defacement](http://cyberinsecure.com/hacked-obama-site-redirects-visitors-to-clintons-site/)
of Barack Obama's website demonstrated the impact of XSS vulnerabilities
to the masses.

During this presentation, we demonstrated exactly how effective XSS
vulns can be, and showed you what you can do to protect yourself and
your sites.

The practicalities of doing live-demos meant that each night we had one
demo fail. At Denver it was the live session stealing demo against a
production website. In Boulder it was the browser-based botnet.

Nevertheless, we hope that you found the presentations interesting, and
the interactive format a welcome change.

meets industry".

Organization and goals:

  - The event showed several points of discussion: we talked from a
    research and industry point of view.
  - As conclusion of the day, we organized a round table discussing the
    more interesting subjects come out during the event.
  - Conference goal was that to create a debate on which will be the
    evolution of the research for the Web Application Security, what
    industry and University are doing and what they should do.

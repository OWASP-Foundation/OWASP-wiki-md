## Discussion

If security vulnerabilities built into your applications’ source code
survive into production, they can become corporate liabilities with
broad and severe business impact on your organization. In view of the
consequences of exploited security vulnerabilities, there is no
reasonable alternative to using best practices of application security
as early as possible in — and throughout — your software development
lifecycle. See figure 3.

To be effective, best practices of software application security must
have a reliable process to guide a development team in creating and
deploying a software application that is as resistant as possible to
security vulnerabilities. Within a software development project, the
CLASP Best Practices are the basis of all security-related software
development activities — whether planning, designing or implementing —
including the use of all tools and techniques that support CLASP.

<td><h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>The OWASP SQL and database Scripting Technology Knowledge Base is the clearing house for all information related to building secure database related applications, as well as services based on SQL and SQL scripting technologies. The focus of the project is on guidance for developers and architects using SQL frameworks, on SQL based technologies for web and distributed application development, on OWASP components that deal with SQL related topics and on participation in OWASP projects that use SQL, PL/SQL, SQL scripting languages and related technologies. Moreover, we aim to provide security related guidance for system administrators managing SQL based applications and tools.</p>
<p>Community content is key to security information. The project depends on content from developers throughout the SQL, PL/SQL and database programming ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<ul>
<li>Provide deep, rich guidance for SQL, PL/SQL and similar languages, as well as database developers in general, in using the security features of SQL, SQL frameworks and various databases.</li>
<li>Address security in relation to the SQL, PL/SQL and derived scripting technologies, including database programming.</li>
<li>Guide system administrators in managing database components and applications - always in relation to security.</li>
<li>Create guidance for use of OWASP components that are designed for use with SQL and databases.</li>
<li>Focus on information about working with and on OWASP tools built using SQL or related SQL technologies.</li>
<li>Provide a stream of security related information, like vulnerabilities and security patches, related to the SQL and database security universe.</li>
<li>Build an ecosystem allowing to all actors interested to discuss, share and learn.</li>

## SQL

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a special-purpose programming
language designed for managing data held in a relational database
management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data
stream management system (RDSMS).

SQL was one of the first commercial languages for Edgar F. Codd's
relational model, as described in his influential 1970 paper, "A
Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks.". Despite not
entirely adhering to the relational model as described by Codd, it
became the most widely used database language.

SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute
(ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO) in 1987. Since then, the standard has been revised
to include a larger set of features. Despite the existence of such
standards, though, most SQL code is not completely portable among
different database systems without adjustments.

## PL/SQL

PL/SQL (Procedural Language/Structured Query Language) is Oracle(tm)
Corporation's proprietary procedural extension to the SQL database
language. Some other SQL database management systems offer similar
extensions to the SQL language. PL/SQL's syntax strongly resembles that
of ADA.

The key strength of PL/SQL is its tight integration with the Oracle
database.

PL/SQL is one of three languages embedded in the Oracle Database, the
other two being SQL and Java.

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/SQL>



## SQL PL

SQL PL stands for Structured Query Language Procedural Language and was
developed by IBM as a set of commands that extend the use of SQL in the
IBM DB2 (DB2 UDB Version 7) database system. It provides procedural
programmability in addition to the querying commands of SQL. It is a
subset of the SQL Persistent Stored Modules (SQL/PSM) language standard.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_PL>



## Transact-SQL

Transact-SQL (T-SQL) is Microsoft's and Sybase's proprietary extension
to SQL. SQL, the acronym for Structured Query Language, is a
standardized computer language that was originally developed by IBM for
querying, altering and defining relational databases, using declarative
statements. T-SQL expands on the SQL standard to include procedural
programming, local variables, various support functions for string
processing, date processing, mathematics, etc. and changes to the DELETE
and UPDATE statements. These additional features make Transact-SQL
Turing complete.

Transact-SQL is central to using Microsoft SQL Server. All applications
that communicate with an instance of SQL Server do so by sending
Transact-SQL statements to the server, regardless of the user interface
of the application.

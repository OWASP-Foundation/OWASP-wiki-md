meeting began at 7:00. The meeting began with introductions followed by
Josh Stroschein's 'The First Five of thew OWASP Top Ten' presentation.
After the presentation Josh opened the floor for any questions. There
was some interest expressed in WebGoat (which I was unable to
demonstrate to due technical difficulties). Josh will be presenting the
bottom five of the OWASP Top Ten at the next meeting, which is scheduled
for May 13, 2009 at Omnitech Inc. Following the presentation will also
be a brief introductory presentation to WebGoat: downloading, running,
and introduction to lesson plans.

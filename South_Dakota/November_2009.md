AGENDA

DSU will be bringing their mobile lab for us to use for some hands-on
training. We will be using a Virtual Machine specifically setup for
training on InfoSec (think WebGoat). This will be a great opportunity to
dig into some of the OWASP Top Ten items and work with them in a
simulated e-commerce environment. Josh Pauli will also be available to
help provide guidance/assistance during this lab. The items that we will
be covering includes:

`   * Reflected XSS`
`   * Stored Xss`
`   * SQL Injection`
`   * Steal money from the store`
`   * XSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)`
`   * Steal songs/Download songs for Free`
`   * Permanently lock users out of their account`
`   * Chained Exploit`

This will be a great lab for individuals of all skill levels, from
beginner to someone experienced in InfoSec this lab will provide
challenges for every level. The lab will be open for discussion as we
work through the challenges (and we will also be providing solutions) so
there will be plenty of time to discuss the vulnerabilities/exploits and
countermeasures as we work through them. We hope to see you there\!

The meeting began at 7pm. Josh S. started with introductions and a brief
overview of OWASP. He also covered some of the top OWASP projects. Josh
Pauli began his presentation at approximately 7:20pm. He began with an
introduction of Dakota State University and its Information Security
degrees. He covered the courses offered, the technology utilized in each
course and if there are any certification equivalents. He also provided
information about several 'out-of-class' activities. One of the major
topics covered was the National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition.
"CCDC is a three day event and the first competition that specifically
focuses on the operational aspect of managing and protecting an existing
“commercial” network infrastructure." He also covered Defcon, which is
"one of the oldest continuous running hacker conventions around, and
also one of the largest." DSU has a local chapter, dc605. DSU is open
for any collaboration, involvement with their clubs/organizations,
projects, etc so feel free to contact them anytime.

After Josh Pauli's presentation Josh Stroschein presented on items 6-10
of the OWASP Top Ten web vulnerabilities followed by an introduction to
WebGoat (setup, installation, first lesson). After the presentation the
meeting was opened to general discussion in which many security related
topics were covered. The meeting adjourned at 9pm.

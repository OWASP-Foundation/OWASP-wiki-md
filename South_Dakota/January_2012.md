The first meeting of the calendar year was held on March 1st at
University Center North in Sioux Falls SD. The meeting opened with
general chapter business and recent news/announcements before the
presentations began. The evenings presentations were:


  - Devon Greene presented on Web Shells. He discussed what they are,
    the impact they can have and what steps can be taken to mitigate
    them.
  - Josh Stroscheing presented on the Nmap Scripting Engine,
    specifically focusing on scripts that empower web developers (sql
    injection fuzzers, etc).

It was decided that the next meeting should be held at the end of April.

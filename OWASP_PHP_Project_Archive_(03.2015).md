## About

The OWASP PHP Project's goal (*[OWASP PHP Project
Roadmap](OWASP_PHP_Project_Roadmap "wikilink")*) is to enable
developers, systems administrators and application architects to build
and deploy secure applications built using the PHP programming language.

## Joining the Project

[Serg Belokamen](mailto:serg@owasp.org) is currently steering the
project.

Please submit your ideas for individual articles to the [OWASP PHP
Project Proposals](OWASP_PHP_Project_Proposals "wikilink").

If you would like to contribute to the OWASP PHP Project please:

1.  Visit the [Tutorial](Tutorial "wikilink");
2.  Join the [mailing
    list](http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-php);
3.  Read the [OWASP PHP Project
    Roadmap](OWASP_PHP_Project_Roadmap "wikilink"); and
4.  Pick a topic from the [OWASP PHP Project
    Proposals](OWASP_PHP_Project_Proposals "wikilink"), [OWASP PHP
    Project Roadmap](OWASP_PHP_Project_Roadmap "wikilink") or suggest a
    new topic.

Remember to add the tag: \[\[Category:OWASP_PHP_Project|Category:OWASP

categorised.

## PHP Security Overview

It is not easy to produce a PHP application without security
vulnerabilities. Most application security
[vulnerabilities](:Category:Vulnerability "wikilink") apply to PHP
applications just like other environments.

The goals of this project are to provide information about building,
configuring, deploying, operating, and maintaining secure PHP
applications. We cover the following topics or pick a topic from the
[OWASP PHP Table of Contents](OWASP_PHP_Table_of_Contents "wikilink")

  - [PHP Security for
    Architects](PHP_Security_for_Architects "wikilink")
    Provides information about the design and architectural
    considerations for a PHP web application. Common architectures such
    as MVC, Ajax, Web Services and PEAR / Zend Frameworks are discussed.

<!-- end list -->

  - [PHP Security for
    Developers](PHP_Security_for_Developers "wikilink")
    This section covers dangerous calls and common vulnerabilities
    associated with them, such as system() exec(), eval() and so on.
    This section will also cover standard security mechanisms available
    in the standard language, such as cryptography, logging, encryption,
    and error handling. Securing elements of an application, such as
    controllers, business logic, and persistence layers will be covered.
    We'll discuss handling request parameters, encoding, injection, and
    more.

<!-- end list -->

  - [PHP Security for
    Deployers](PHP_Security_for_Deployers "wikilink")
    These articles cover topics specifically related to the PHP hosting
    environment. We discuss minimizing the attack surface, configuring
    error handlers, and performing hardening of PHP.

## Overview

The WebGoatV5 application is designed to illustrate typical security
flaws within web-applications. It is intended to teach a structured
approach to testing for, and exploiting such vulnerabilities within the
context of an Application Security Assessment.

A full Application Security Assessment testing methodology is being
documented by
<u><http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Project></u> and this
will provide a superset of the issues demonstrated within the WebGoat.
It may include a formal design and code review, for example. The WebGoat
lessons aim to give practical training and examples relating to the
*Implementation* *Review* phase of the OWASP Web Application Security
Testing Methodology.

The WebGoatv5 Application provides a testing platform for a typical
application security assessment. The assessor is given the same
information and rights as a typical customer or client of an on-line
application.

  - The application is web based
  - The attack simulations are remote

All of the described techniques may be performed from any connected
location.

  - The testing is black-box

Source code is not supplied, but it can be viewed and downloaded.

  - Credentials and operational information is provided

Of course, the teaching aspect of WebGoat means that certain information
will be revealed that would not typically be available. This makes it
possible to guide the tester through an assessment process.

The current lesson plans provided in WebGoatv5 include:

<td><p>ESAPI (The OWASP Enterprise Security API) is a free, open source, web application security control library that makes it easier for programmers to write lower-risk applications. The ESAPI libraries are designed to make it easier for programmers to retrofit security into existing applications. The ESAPI libraries also serve as a solid foundation for new development.</p>
<p>Allowing for language-specific differences, all OWASP ESAPI versions have the same basic design:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>There is a set of security control interfaces.</strong> They define for example types of parameters that are passed to types of security controls.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>There is a reference implementation for each security control.</strong> The logic is not organization‐specific and the logic is not application‐specific. An example: string‐based input validation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>There are optionally your own implementations for each security control.</strong> There may be application logic contained in these classes which may be developed by or for your organization. An example: enterprise authentication.</li>

# What I did with ESAPI

  - I used ESAPI for Java with Google AppEngine. I used it for simple
    validation and encoding. --[Jeff](mailto:jeff.williams@owasp.org)

<!-- end list -->

  - I used ESAPI for PHP with a custom web 2.0 corporate knowledge
    management application, made up of many open source and commercial
    applications integrated to work together. I added an organization-
    and application-specific "Adapter" control to wrap calls to the
    other ESAPI controls. --[Mike](mailto:mike.boberski@owasp.org)

<!-- end list -->

  - I used ESAPI for Java’s "Logger" control to make it easier for a US
    Government customer to meet C\&A requirements.
    --[Dave](mailto:dave.wichers@owasp.org)

<!-- end list -->

  - I used ESAPI for Java to build a low risk web application that was
    over 250,000+ lines of code in size.
    --[Jim](mailto:jim.manico@owasp.org)

<!-- end list -->

  - I used ESAPI for Java's "Authenticator" to replace a spaghetti-like
    mechanism in a legacy financial services web application. In
    hindsight I should have used the application-specific "Adapter"
    pattern mentioned by Mike above. The organization also uses the
    ESAPI Encryptor as an interface to a hardware security module.
    --[Roman](mailto:roman.hustad@yahoo.com)

<!-- end list -->

  - I use ESAPI to be our security package for all our product, this way
    we can set one standard for all products.
    --[Yair](mailto:yairr@liveperson.com)

<!-- end list -->

  - I use ESAPI for Java to educate developers about application
    security principals at several of the world’s largest organizations.

# Should I use ESAPI?

\[NOTE: The heretical opinions on this ESAPI tab are 100% my own and do
not necessarily reflect the rest of other ESAPI contributors or the
OWASP staff, leadership, community. --kevin wall\]

Or, specifically, "Should I use ESAPI for Java?" since that's the only
one run by OWASP that still shows any semblance of life. Maintenance
activities is down, way down in fact of its peak development activities.
Some of us are still trying and haven't given up and volunteers are
still welcome. But without active contributors, projects make slow
progress.

The first question to ask is, are you already using ESAPI in your
project, and if so, do you have a lot vested in it? If so, then the
answer to "Should I use ESAPI?" probably is "yes". The second question
you should ask, if I'm using it, why am I not contributing to it in some
manner? But we won't go there.

If you are starting out on a new project or trying for the first time to
secure an existing project, then _before_ you consider ESAPI, you
should consider these possible alternatives:

  - Output encoding: [OWASP Java Encoder
    Project](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Java_Encoder_Project)
  - General HTML sanitization: [OWASP Java HTML
    Sanitizer](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Java_HTML_Sanitizer_Project)
  - Validation: [JSR-303/JSR-349 Bean
    Validation](http://beanvalidation.org/)
  - Strong cryptography: [Google Tink](https://github.com/google/tink),
    [Keyczar](https://github.com/google/keyczar)
  - Authentication / authorization: [Apache
    Shiro](https://shiro.apache.org/)
  - CSRF protection: [OWASP CSRFGuard
    Project](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_CSRFGuard_Project)
    or [OWASP CSRFProtector
    Project](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/CSRFProtector_Project)

Note that this is not to suggest that ESAPI is dead, but rather to
acknowledge the fact that it isn't being as well-maintained as most F500
companies would like for their enterprise software. There may be
alternatives, such as companies that you can purchase ESAPI support
from. Those are not being considered here for various reasons, not the
least of which is to remain vendor neutral. Rather, instead these
recommendations should be taken as possible alternatives to secure your
application. It is not a perfect world that we live in, but I would be
remiss as an appsec guy if I were to plug ESAPI over other good security
solutions simply because of my contributions to / involvement with
ESAPI. I think that ESAPI has it's place and I will do my best to
maintain it, but not to the exclusion of my family or day job. If you
would like to volunteer to help, you know where to find me.

![Image:Asvs-letters.jpg](Asvs-letters.jpg
"Image:Asvs-letters.jpg")**ESAPI Terminology**

  - **adapter** - There are optionally your own implementations for each
    security control. There may be application logic contained in these
    classes which may be developed by or for your organization. The
    logic may be organization-specific and/or application-specific.
    There may be proprietary information or logic contained in these
    classes which may be developed by or for your organization.
  - **built-in singleton design pattern** - The "built-in" singleton
    design pattern refers to the replacement of security control
    reference implementations with your own implementations. ESAPI
    interfaces are otherwise left intact.
  - **codec** - ESAPI encoder/decoder reference implementations.
  - **core** - The ESAPI interfaces and reference implementations that
    are not intended to be replaced with enterprise-specific versions
    are called the ESAPI Core.
  - **exception** - ESAPI exception reference implementations.
  - **extended factory design pattern** - The "extended" factory design
    pattern refers to the addition of a new security control interface
    and corresponding implementation, which in turn calls ESAPI security
    control reference implementations and/or security control reference
    implementations that were replaced with your own implementations.
    The ESAPI locator class would be called in order to retrieve a
    singleton instance of your new security control, which in turn would
    call ESAPI security control reference implementations and/or
    security control reference implementations that were replaced with
    your own implementations.
  - **extended singleton design pattern** - The "extended" singleton
    pattern refers to the replacement of security control reference
    implementations with your own implementations and the
    addition/modification/subtraction of corresponding security control
    interfaces.
  - **ES-enable (or ESAPI-enable)** - Just as web applications and web
    services can be Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) enabled (PK-enabled)
    to perform for example certificate-based authentication,
    applications and services can be OWASP ESAPI-enabled (ES-enabled) to
    enable applications and services to protect themselves from
    attackers.
  - **filter** - In ESAPI for Java, there is additionally an HTTP filter
    that can be called separately from the other controls.
  - **interfaces** - There is a set of security control interfaces.
    There is no application logic contained in these interfaces. They
    define for example types of parameters that are passed to types of
    security controls. There is no proprietary information or logic
    contained in these interfaces.
  - **locator** - The ESAPI security control interfaces include an
    "ESAPI" class that is commonly referred to as a "locator" class. The
    ESAPI locator class is called in order to retrieve singleton
    instances of individual security controls, which are then called in
    order to perform security checks (such as performing an access
    control check) or that result in security effects (such as
    generating an audit record).
  - **reference implementation** - There is a reference implementation
    for each security control. There is application logic contained in
    these classes, i.e. contained in these interface implementations.
    However, the logic is not organization-specific and the logic is not
    application-specific. There is no proprietary information or logic
    contained in these reference implementation classes.
  - **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** - In ESAPI for Java, there is
    additionally a Web Application Firewall (WAF) that can be called
    separately from the other controls.

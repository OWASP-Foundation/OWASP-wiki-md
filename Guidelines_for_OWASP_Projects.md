This page is maintained by the OWASP Project Task Force to help assist
Project Leaders with information about successfully running an OWASP
Project. It will be updated from time to time, and changes will be
discussed and announced on the OWASP-Leaders list.

## Project Wiki Pages

  - When a new project is started, we will create a wiki page as the
    official homepage for your project. It will contain the
    \[\[Category:OWASP_Project|Category:OWASP Project\]\] tag at the
    bottom. Please ensure this tag stays on your project homepage.

<!-- end list -->

  - Project wiki pages will also be listed in the appropriate category
    on the [OWASP Projects](:Category:OWASP_Project "wikilink") page,
    which means that, initially, until being
    [assessed](:Category:OWASP_Project_Assessment "wikilink"), it will
    be placed alphabetically within the [‘Alpha Status
    Projects’](:Category:OWASP_Project#Alpha_Status_Projects "wikilink")
    category. Exceptions can be made for special circumstances (e.g.
    pre-established project being brought into OWASP), so contact the
    [OWASP Global Projects
    Committee](Global_Projects_Committee "wikilink") for more
    information.

<!-- end list -->

  - We'll start your project homepage with a **Project Identification**
    template to capture the relevant meta-data that you already provided
    about your project. For example, the [Live CD Project
    page](:Category:OWASP_Live_CD_Project "wikilink") contains the
    source code {{Template:OWASP Live CD Project}} and the
    [template](:Template:OWASP_Live_CD_Project "wikilink") is
    automatically embedded on the project page.

<!-- end list -->

  - You may move your **Project Identification** template anywhere you'd
    like (top/bottom of the page, to a separate tab, etc.) but please
    ensure it stays linked from your project's page. If you really would
    like it to be out of the way, you can just edit the **Project
    Identification** page and tag it with your project's category label,
    such as \[\[Category:OWASP_Enterprise_Security_API|Category:OWASP
    Enterprise Security API\]\], and then no link on your project's
    homepage is required.

<!-- end list -->

  - Your project homepage belongs to your project and you are free to
    design it as you like (some good examples of different styles
    include the [ESAPI Project
    page](:Category:OWASP_Enterprise_Security_API "wikilink") and the
    [Live CD Project page](:Category:OWASP_Live_CD_Project "wikilink")).
    It's usually a good idea to include information about your project
    including detailed descriptions, screenshots, download links, a link
    to the project mailing list, contact information for the project
    leader, and any other relevant information.

<!-- end list -->

  - You can have as many wiki pages as you want to support your project.
    Please feel free to create them yourself. Everything posted on the
    wiki is accessible by many people around the world.

<!-- end list -->

  - If you have never edited a wiki, take a quick look at the [this
    cheat sheet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Cheatsheet) for
    basic editing help. Also, [OpenOffice](http://www.openoffice.org/)
    is a free *office suite* which includes the ability to export to
    MediaWiki text. The exported text file contents can be copied and
    pasted into OWASP's wiki.

## Project Sponsorship

Many OWASP projects are made more successful through contributions from
sponsor organizations that donate money or man-power. But, managing
sponsorship attribution over time can become tricky, so here are some
general guidelines for project leaders based on common cases:

  - In cases where sponsors contribute materials governed by an
    open-source license that requires attribution, Project Leaders
    should ensure that attribution is done accordingly. In such
    instances, it may also be necessary to attribute individual
    contributors.

<!-- end list -->

  - For financial contributions to a project (e.g. an outside
    organization donating through [OWASP Season of
    Code](OWASP_Season_of_Code "wikilink") sponsorship), sponsors should
    be attributed for at least 1 year. After that, Project Leaders are
    free to leave or remove the sponsorship attribution.

<!-- end list -->

  - Sponsors can be attributed by name or through display of their logo.
    This can appear on the project homepage or built in to the
    document/tool itself. This is the choice of the Project Leader.

## Project Licensing

For OWASP projects, the materials are available under an approved FLOSS
(Free, Libre and Open Source Software) license. For more information,
please see the [OWASP Licenses
page](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Licenses). Some other items
to consider when choosing a license:

  - For documentation projects, the [Creative Commons Attribution
    ShareAlike 3.0
    license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) is good
    choice as that license was designed for creative endeavors such as
    written works.

<!-- end list -->

  - For tools and other coding projects, an approved FLOSS license is
    recommend as these were designed for software creation. Examples of
    FLOSS licenses for coding projects are:
      - GNU GPL
        ([version 3](http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl.html) and
        [version 2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html))
      - BSD License (aka modified or 3-clause BSD license [see
        section 2.2](http://www.xfree86.org/3.3.6/COPYRIGHT2.html#5) for
        an example)
      - Apache 2.0 License ([license
        text](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0))

When choosing a software license, the primary difference between
licenses deals with the restrictions and permissions enforced by the
license. The restrictions and permissions enforced by the chosen license
can have impacts on business adoption and contributions by the community
at large. Consideration should be given to existing and well established
licenses as these are much better understood by the IT and business
community in general. For more assistance on selecting a license, here
are some general references:

    page](http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/). The FSF authored the
    GPL licenses.

    page](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/category) ordered by
    category.

    can provide advice on license selection as well.

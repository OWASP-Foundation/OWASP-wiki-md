## Presentations

### OWASP Update

New about whatâ€™s going on locally and globally within OWASP

### IRMA / Attribute Based Credentials

Attribute based credentials allow people to prove some attribute (like
age, gender, subscription to a service, etc.) without leaving any other
trace. The IRMA project (www.irmacard.org) has fully implemented this
very privacy friendly authentication technology on a smart card. In this
presentation I will talk about the technology behind IRMA, it's
concepts, and our plans for the future.

### How data-protection can be improved

Tools are important to both hackers and security testers, but they are
not 'the silver bullit'. You need to understand the limitations of tools
in order to get the most efficiency out of them. In this presentation
some tips and tricks for well-known tools will be shown to get you
started getting the right mind-set in using them.

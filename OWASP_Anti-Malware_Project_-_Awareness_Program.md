## Banking Malware Attack Process

The process involving Malware attack require the subsequent verification
of each of the following steps to be successful. We consider an attack
to be successful if the attacker obtain a financial gain from the
initial client attack. The very steps (e.g. Infection of clients)
usually do not involve the Banking infrastrucure, while others are
tightly connected to it. Attackers absolutely need the functionalities
offered by the hacked online bank accounts to do cash outs.

### From user infection to cash out

(Image is missing)

This is a chain of required steps. Attackers need to perform
successfully each of these for turning the attack into a monetary gain.
For this reason the process can be reasonably stopped at any level. As
in other cases a defense in depth approach is suggested to be effective
against the weakest link of each part of the attack.

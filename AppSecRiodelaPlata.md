## About the Workshop

We plan to start with a 1.5 hour session including an overview of the
chapter handbook. This session will be video taped and available for
chapter leaders to use in their local chapters (or to be viewed by those
unable to attend). The second part of the workshop will be a roundtable
discussion on regional issues and challenges, with a goal of working
together to create solutions. If you are interested in participating in
either of these workshops, please register for the conference and select
this workshop, please register for the Conference and select the
optional session "chapter leaders workshop" as part of the registration
process. Remember that conference attendance is free for current chapter
and project leaders.

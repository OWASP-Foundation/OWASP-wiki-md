"Owasp_logo_normal.jpg")Most penetration testers use many separate tools
to get the job done. The problem is that many of the security tools
available today do not have formats can allow for the tools to easily
communicate directly. This makes automation very difficult. This speech
will explain some of ways to fix the problem. We will be releasing
several modules that allow for pentesters to integrate the data so that
we can work towards automating a large portion of the process so that
the pentesters can focus on the difficult aspects of the assessment that
can not be automated. All pentests need to focus on performing the tasks
that no automated solution can. This will be done integrating the
existing tools we will make a large step in that direction.

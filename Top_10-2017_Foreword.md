Insecure software is undermining our financial, healthcare, defense,
energy, and other critical infrastructure. As our software becomes
increasingly complex, and connected, the difficulty of achieving
application security increases exponentially. The rapid pace of modern
software development processes makes the most common risks essential to
discover and resolve quickly and accurately. We can no longer afford to
tolerate relatively simple security problems like those presented in
this OWASP Top 10.

A great deal of feedback was received during the creation of the OWASP
Top 10 - 2017, more than for any other equivalent OWASP effort. This
shows how much passion the community has for the OWASP Top 10, and thus
how critical it is for OWASP to get the Top 10 right for the majority of
use cases.

Although the original goal of the OWASP Top 10 project was simply to
raise awareness amongst developers and managers, it has become
<i>the</i> de facto application security standard.Â 

In this release, issues and recommendations are written concisely and in
a testable way to assist with the adoption of the OWASP Top 10 in
application security programs. We encourage large and high performing
organizations to use the <u>[OWASP Application Security Verification
Standard (ASVS)](ASVS "wikilink")</u> if a true standard is required,
but for most, the OWASP Top 10 is a great start on the application
security journey.

We have written up a range of suggested next steps for different users
of the OWASP Top 10, including
<b><u>[text=documentRootTop10New]({{Top_10:LanguageFile "wikilink")</u></b>,
<b><u>[text=documentRootTop10New]({{Top_10:LanguageFile "wikilink")</u></b>,
<b><u>[text=documentRootTop10New]({{Top_10:LanguageFile "wikilink")</u></b>,
which is suitable for CIOs and CISOs, and
<b><u>[text=documentRootTop10New]({{Top_10:LanguageFile "wikilink")</u></b>,
which is suitable for application managers or anyone responsible for the
lifecycle of the application.

In the long term, we encourage all software development teams and
organizations to create an application security program that is
compatible with your culture and technology. These programs come in all
shapes and sizes. Leverage your organization's existing strengths to
measure and improve your application security program using the
<u>[Software Assurance Maturity
Model](OWASP_SAMM_Project "wikilink")</u>.

We hope that the OWASP Top 10 is useful to your application security
efforts. Please don't hesitate to contact OWASP with your questions,
comments, and ideas at our GitHub project repository:

Lastly, we wish to thank the founding leadership of the OWASP Top 10
project, Dave Wichers and Jeff Williams, for all their efforts, and
believing in us to get this finished with the community's help. Thank
you\!

**18:30 Introduction**

**18:45 Andy Hornsby-Jones**

Andy's bio line probably best introduces this:"I also like to break
things." Andy has a tool talk covering some of the methods used to
identify vulnerabilities and exploit them.

**19:30 Matt Summers** (NCC)

Matt's research into website & online reputation identified a need to
gauge how far a site considered 'safe' such as maybe the BBC was from
links to known malware. He's been developing the tool and wants to
introduce it to the chapter.

**20:15 PwC Penetration tester** (tbc)

PwC's information security team has been busy with the topical
heartbleed and is going to look at some methods used to detect the
vulnerability, (if the demo works) detect attempts to exploit the
vulnerability and share some of the defence mechanism's.

**21:00 Informal Discussion & Networking** Britons Protection, Vine Inn
or City Arms for extended networking...

Finally, OWASP is a non-commercial volunteer led organisation, if you
find the networking, talks or content useful, please consider whether
you can help out in providing facilities, locations, talks or a donation

please get in touch via the mailing list or one of the chapter leaders.

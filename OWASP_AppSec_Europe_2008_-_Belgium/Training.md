## T1. Building and Testing Secure Web Applications - 2-Day Course - May 19-20, 2008

**Course Overview**

Most developers, IT professionals, and auditors learn what they know
about application security on the job, usually by making mistakes.
Application security is not a part of many computer science curricula
today and most organizations have not focused on instituting a culture
that includes application security as a core part of their IT security
efforts.

This powerful two day course focuses on the most common web application
security problems, including the OWASP Top Ten. The course will
introduce and demonstrate hacking techniques, illustrating how
application vulnerabilities can be exploited so students really
understand how to avoid introducing such vulnerabilities into their
code.

**Details**

This course starts with a module designed to raise awareness of just how
insecure most web applications are. We demonstrate how easily hackers
are able to attack web applications, and what some of the most common
and most significant vulnerabilities are. The course then provides an
overview of how web applications work from a security perspective.

The next modules detail a number of specific security areas. We describe
common vulnerabilities, present best practices, and discuss recommended
approaches for avoiding such vulnerabilities. This course includes
coverage of the following web application security areas (which
encompass the entire OWASP Top 10 plus more):

  - Authentication and Session Management
  - Access Control
  - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - Input Validation
  - Protecting Sensitive Data (w/ Crypto)
  - Caching, Pooling, and Reuse Errors
  - Database Security (Including SQL Injection)
  - Error Handling and Logging
  - Denial of Service
  - Code Quality
  - Accessing Services Securely
  - Setting Security Policy
  - Integrating Security into the SDLC

For each area, the course covers the following:

  - Theoretical foundations
  - Recommended security policies
  - Common pitfalls when implementing
  - Details on historical exploits
  - Best practices for implementation

**Hands on Exercises**

To cement the principles delivered via the lecture portion of the
course, students can participate in a number of hands-on security
testing exercises. During the hands-on exercises students will attack a
live web application (i.e., WebGoat) that has been seeded with common
web application vulnerabilities. The students will use proxy tools
commonly used by the hacker community to complete the exercises.

**Requirements**

If you are interested in participating in the hands on portion of the
course, please bring a Windows based laptop.

**Registration**

Registration is available via the OWASP Conference Cvent site at: [Cvent

## T2. Leading the Development of Secure Applications - 1-Day Course - May 19, 2008

**Summary**

In this one-day management session you’ll get the answers to the ten key
questions that most CIOs and development managers face when trying to
improve security in the development process. The course provides proven
techniques and valuable lessons learned that can be applied to projects
at any phase of their application’s lifecycle.

**Course Overview**

The following important questions are answered in this course.

  - Why is application security so important?
  - What are the most critical vulnerability areas to focus on and how?
  - What security tools and technologies do software projects need?
  - How do I establish an application security initiative in my
    organization?
  - How can I enhance my SDLC to include security activities?
  - How do I measure my organization’s progress in application security?
  - How can I get my developers to care about application security?
  - What teams and roles should I create to address application
    security?
  - How do I get a handle on the security of my entire application
    portfolio?
  - What is the most effective way of securing legacy applications?

This is the right course at the right time for any executive who has
decided that secure application development is a priority. The analyst
community is helping CIOs understand just how critical the problem of
insecure programming has become. For example the

Robert Francis Group (a well-known application development analyst
group) wrote: “The lack of application security requirements and
associated poor security focus in the development process can cripple
business application security leading to significant revenue loss and
perhaps liability claims from anyone impacted by this oversight. IT
executives should review application development processes and direct
development teams to build in security, rather than consider it after
the application deployment.”

This course gives executives and managers the education and practical
guidance they need to ensure that software projects properly address
security. The course is designed to provide a firm understanding of the
importance of software security, the critical security activities
required within the software development lifecycle, and how to
efficiently manage security issues during development and maintenance.
This understanding is reinforced through industry awareness and live
demonstrations of commonly found vulnerabilities in software.

**Audience**

The intended audience for this course is: Program Managers, Account
Managers, Functional/Resource Application Managers, Technical
Program/Project Managers (Chief Engineers), Executives, Directors, and
Key/Technical Decision Makers

## T3. Building Secure Rich Internet Applications - 1-Day Course - May 20, 2008

**Summary**

This one day class will cover common RIA security threats and
vulnerabilities and it will provide specific guidance on how to develop
RIA to defend against these threats and vulnerabilities. Training
developers on secure coding practices offers one of highest returns on
investment of any security investment by eliminating vulnerabilities at
the source. Aspect’s Building Secure RIA Course is designed to enable
developers to use RIA technologies in their web applications without
introducing security issues. The course provides detailed examples of
‘what to do’ and ‘what not to do.' The class is lead by Dave Wichers,
Aspect COO, and is delivered in a very interactive manner. The course
will use demonstrations, code examples, and spot-the-bug exercises to
get developers engaged in the topic. Developers will leave with an
understanding of how RIA attacks work, the impacts of successful
attacks, and what to do to defend against them.

**Course Overview** The course begins with an overview and a Web 2.0
introduction. The next section deals with exploring the AJAX and RIA
surface attacks, followed by Authentication and Session control
sections. Cross Site Request Forgery, Cross Site Scripting and
Protecting Sensitive Data, are the next sections which are followed by
Error Handling and Logging and References to round out the day.

**Requirements**

If you are interested in participating in the hands on portion of the
course, please bring a Windows based laptop.

## T4. Building Secure Web Services - 2-Day Course - May 19-20, 2008

**Course Overview**

The movement towards Web Services and Service Oriented architecture
(SOA) paradigms requires new security paradigms to deal with new risks
posed by these architectures. Building Secure Web Services introduces
the student to all of the commonly used web services and SOA functional
and security standards (including web services, XML, HTTP, and SOA
standards), and then focuses on presenting effective ways for providing
the security characteristics required in each of the core web services
security areas. These areas include encryption, authentication, access
control, input validation, error handling and logging, etc.

**Details**

The course starts with a module on the core functional and security
standards involved in web services and an overview of web services
security. This is followed by a high level approach for doing threat
modeling for web services enabled applications.

After this introduction, each web services vulnerability area is covered
in detail, discussing the common threats and alternate approaches for
addressing those threats, including both standards based (where they
exist) and best practice based security approaches. This course teaches
practical implementation and testing techniques, including the use of
hands on testing exercises to discover and exploit web services
vulnerabilities as well as hands on solution development exercises for
eliminating these vulnerabilities.

The course concludes with coverage on how to establish trust between
services, some exercises on applying what we have learned, and then a
significant discussion on SOA and its impact on web services security.

The course outline for this course is as follows:

  - Introduction to Web Services Security
  - Web Services Security Threat Modeling
  - How to Secure Web Services Communications and Protect Sensitive Data
    (e.g., XML Encryption/Signature)
  - Managing Authentication and Identity within Web Services (e.g.,
    SAML, WS-Trust, WS-Secure Conversation)
  - How to Control Access to Web Services (e.g., SAML, XACML, XML
    Gateways)
  - How to Validate Input and Protect Output in Web Services (e.g.,
    DTDs, XSDs, custom)
  - Error Handling, Logging, Accountability, and Monitoring within Web
    Services
  - Providing and Protecting Discovery Services (UDDI)
  - Establishing Trust between Services (e.g., WS-Security, SAML,
    WS-Federation)
  - Applying What We’ve Learned
  - Service Oriented Architectures (SOA)

**Hands on Exercises**

To cement the principles delivered via the lecture portion of the
course, students can participate in a number of hands-on security
testing exercises. During the hands-on exercises students will attack a
live web application (i.e., WebGoat) that has been seeded with common
web application vulnerabilities. The students will use proxy tools
commonly used by the hacker community to complete the exercises.

#### Presentation Abstracts

**The Building Security In Maturity Model (BSIMM)**

*Gary McGraw*, Cigital

As a discipline, software security has made great progress over the last
decade. There are now at least 34 large scale software security
initiatives underway in enterprises including global financial services
firms, independent software vendors, defense organizations, and other
verticals. In 2008, Brian Chess, Sammy Migues and I interviewed the
executives running nine initiatives using the twelve practices of the
Software Security Framework as our guide. Those companies among the nine
who graciously agreed to be identified include: Adobe, The Depository
Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), EMC, Google, Microsoft, QUALCOMM,
and Wells Fargo. The resulting data, drawn from real programs at
different levels of maturity was used to guide the construction of the
Building Security In Maturity Model (BSIMM). This talk will describe the
observation-based maturity model, drawing examples from many real
software security programs. A maturity model is appropriate because
improving software security almost always means changing the way an
organization works ---people, process, and automation are all required.
While not all organizations need to achieve the same security goals, all
successful large scale software security initiatives share common ideas
and approaches. Whether you rely on the Cigital Touchpoints, Microsoft's
SDL, or OWASP CLASP, there is much to learn from practical experience.
Use the BSIMM as a yardstick to determine where you stand and what kind
of software security plan will work best for you.

**Agile and Secure: Can We Do Both?**

*Jason Li and Jerry Hoff*, Aspect Security

Agile is taking the software development world by storm, but security
has been slow to adapt. What can we learn from the Agile movement? Is it
possible to achieve security and remain Agile? Jason and Jerry will
share Aspect Security's experiences working with Agile teams to gain
assurance and save money. They'll compare and contrast traditional
waterfall and agile processes and show how we can achieve assurance and
security while remaining true to Agile principles.

**Deploying Secure Web Applications with OWASP Resources**

*Kuai Hinojosa*, NY University and OWASP

Universities are key to making application security visible and the need
to educate software developers about application security as an aspect
of proper software development has never been more important. In this
presentation I will share how OWASP resources can be used by
universities to develop, test and deploy secure web applications. I will
discuss challenges that Universities currently face integrating a
pplication security best practices, describe how OWASP tools and
resources are currently used at New York University to test for most
common web application flaws. I will introduce projects such as the
OWASP Enterprise Security API which can be used to mitigate most common
flaws in web applications and share initiatives the OWASP Global
Education Committee is currently working on. If you are interested in
securing web applications, and supporting the OWASP Global Education
Committee efforts you don't want to miss this\!

**The Logic and Semantic Layer of Web Application Security**

*Thomas Schreiber*, SecureNet

Testing Web Application Security mostly focusses on technical weaknesses
only. But there is a huge field of potential weaknesses above the server
layer and beyond the implementational aspects. Even if a web application
is totally free from security bugs in code and system, it may still be
vulnerable to dangerous threats. It is the kind how the business logic
is mapped onto software, that gives an attacker a starting point for his
bad intents. The presentation shows, illustrated with various real
examples, how a clever hacker may reveal sensitive data - including
credit card data -, enter into user accounts or conduct a
denial-of-service on the whole infrastructure - not only the server - by
attacking the logical and semantical layers. The presentation also gives
hints on how to avoid these pitfalls.


**Making a Case for Data Security to Network-Centric Peers and Managers
and Leveraging Web Application Firewalls (WAF) and Database Activity
Monitoring (DAM) to Augment Secure Coding & Review Practices**

*Brian Contos*, Imperva

Information system security has changed. The days of being focused on
network security measures, operating system vulnerabilities, and open
ports, while still important, is no longer the main concern for most
organizations. Today, the attackers – organized crime, competitors,
nation-states, and malicious insiders are going after the assets that
process and store data: applications and databases. The criminals are
already fighting the fight on this front. In response, organizations are
deploying new defenses - adopting application and data security
countermeasures that allow them to protect, monitor and respond to
nefarious activity.

**OWASP ROI: Optimize Security Spending using OWASP**

*Matt Tesauro*

Considering the current economic times, security spending is tighter
than ever. This presentation will cover the Open Web Application
Security Project (OWASP) projects and how they can improve your
application security posture in a budgetfriendly way. OWASP is an open
community dedicated to enabling organizations to develop, purchase, and
maintain applications that can be trusted. The OWASP Foundation is a
notforprofit entity and provides unbiased, practical, costeffective
information about application security. Projects covered include the
OWASP Top 10, OWASP Testing Guide, OpenSAMM Enterprise Security API
(ESAPI), Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS), Application
Security Desk Reference (ASDR) and others. A case study of a specific
company's success with implementing OWASP methodologies and tools will
also be provided. In this case study, the company realized a saving of
nearly $400,000 in year one.

[Video](http://vimeo.com/7461624)


**Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM)**

*Pravir Chandra*, Fortify

The Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) (http://www.opensamm.org)
is a flexible and prescriptive framework for building security into a
software development organization. Covering more than typical SDLC-based
models for security, SAMM enables organizations to self-assess their
security assurance program and then use recommended roadmaps to improve
in a way that's aligned to the specific risks facing the organization.
Beyond that, SAMM enables creation of scorecards for an organization's
effectiveness at secure software development throughout the typical
governance, development, and deployment business functions. Scorecards
also enable management within an organization to demonstrate
quantitative improvements through iterations of building a security
assurance program. This workshop will introduce the SAMM framework and
walk through useful activities such as assessing an assurance program,
mapping an existing organization to a recommended roadmap, and
iteratively building an assurance program. Time allowing, additional
case studies will also be discussed. SAMM is an open a free project and
has recently been added under the Open Web Application Security Project
(OWASP).

**SQL Injection: Amplifying Data Lekeage**
*Ulisses Castro*

Talk about how some SQL Injection techniques works and how they can be
more effective when mixin with some available database native functions.

The main idea is how you can amplifying the amount of data that is
downloaded per request to the web server.

[Video](http://vimeo.com/7460521)


**Automated SQL Ownage Techniques**

*Sebastian Cufre*, Core Security

This talk is about web application security assessment. In particular,
in this talk we set to improve the assessment process for SQL injection
vulnerabilities by providing the means to discard exogenous "false
positive" alarms and confirm exploitable vulnerabilities.

We propose a black-box technique to detect and exploit SQL injection
vulnerabilities. The exploitation provides an interface to execute
arbitrary SQL code through them. Therefore, we are able to thoroughly
assess the impact of the vulnerability (e.g., understand what a hacker
can do).

The core of this talk is in examining the difficulties that appear while
trying to expose vulnerability and how to do a black-box interaction to
automatically construct an exploit.

**Praticas e ferramentas fundamentais para o desenvolvimento de software
seguro (*Tools and Practices for Secure Software Development*)**

*Cassio Goldschmidt*, Symantec

Implementing a security program for the whole application life cycle can
be a daunting and costly task. So, in the development of this talk, we
will demonstrate how it is possible to lessen the risk of this program,
using high quality resource freely available on the Internet and
studying the practices considered fundamental by SAFECode members (EMC,
Juniper, Microsoft, Nokia, SAP, symantec).

**Abordagem Preventiva para Teste de Segurança em Aplicações Web
(*Preventive Approach for Web Application Security Testing*)**

*Luiz Otávio Duarte, Ferrucio de Franco Rosa, Walcir M. Cardoso Jr.*,
CTI/MCT

The objetive of this lecture is to present the approach used by CTI
(Renato Archer Information Technology Center, institution under the
Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology) for security testing of
web applications. The presentation is organized as follows: First, an
introduction will be presented, including important concepts,
motivation, statistics and most critical vulnerabilities nowadays.

Later will be shown techniques for software testing and techniques for
software security testing. Then we show the approach used by CTI to
security testing web application such as inspection of source code, use
of regular expressions and vulnerability detection techniques. A
pratical demonstration will be presented after the approach overview.

The presentation will be finalized with conclusions and recommendations
of best practices for security testing web applications.

**ModSecurity: Firewall OpenSource para Aplicações Web (WAF)
(*ModSecurity, Open Source Web Application Firewall*)**

*Klaubert Herr da Silveira*

With the growing complexity and importance of web applications, short
development schedule, new attack techniques and the lack of attention
and/or focus of developer with security, regulations and the seek for
best practices, is necessary add a new layer of security to web
applications, the "web applications firewalls" or WAF's. This talk will
show the concepts of WAF, specially of ModSecurity, open source web
application firewall, a powerful and complex tool, designed to
understand and protect the web applications of many types, Will be
presented their functionalities, and how it can help the day-by-day of a
web site, for monitoring, protection or even as a troubleshooting tool
for web application.

[Video](http://vimeo.com/7462060)


**Programação Segura utilizando Análise Estática (*Secure Programming
with Static Analysis*)**

*Philippe Sevestre*, LeadComm

Creating secure code requires more than just good intentions.
Programmers need to know how to make their code safe in an almost
infinite number of scenarios and configurations. Static source code
analysis gives users the ability to review their work with a fine-tooth
comb and uncover the kinds of errors that lead directly to
vulnerabilities. This talk frames the software security problem and
shows how static analysis is part of the solution.

We will look at how static analysis works, how to integrate it into the
software development processes, and how to make the most of it during
security code review. Along the way we'll look at examples taken from
real-world security incidents, showing how coding errors are exploited,
how they could have been prevented, and how static analysis can rapidly
uncover similar errors.

Due to their integration characteristics and because they use open
standards, web services have become an area of great interest to
academics and industry. Firstly, we will introduce the basic concepts of
a service oriented architecture, so the training can be self sufficient.
After, we will present the main security standards and specifications in
development and which must be adopted for web services. Lastly, the
training ends with an exposition of the current challenges in web
service security.


**Hands on Web Application Testing using the OWASP Testing Guide.**

*Matt Tesauro*, OWASP

Date: Oct 27 and 28 (2 days)
Time: all day

The training will cover the critical areas of web application testing
using the OWASP Testing Guide v3 as the framework for testing an
application and the OWASP Live CD for the tools to test with. A custom
version of the OWASP Live CD will be created for the training. It will
include a self-contained testing environment providing vulnerable
applications so that both tools and the applications to test them on are
provided.

the hands-on activities. Each student should bring its own
laptop.</span>

*How to get there*

We are trying to provided a transfer from somewhere in the *Esplanada
dos Ministérios*, which is accessible by bus. Any new information on
this will be posted in this page.

To go by taxi, show the map to the driver. It is improbable tha any taxi
driver will be able to get you to the training sessions location just by
reading is address. With the map, arriving to the location is quite easy
and fast from any downtown location.

We strongly recommend against getting to the trainings in your own car,
as it is very difficult to find unused parking slots in this part of
town.

***Call For Papers***

**Q. What is the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)?**

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a worldwide free
and open community focused on improving the security of application
software. Our mission is to make application security visible, so that
people and organizations can make informed decisions about true
application security risks. Everyone is free to participate in OWASP and
all of our materials are available under a free and open software
license. The OWASP Foundation is a 501c3 not-for-profit charitable
organization that ensures the ongoing availability and support for our
work with your support.

**Q. How many speaking slots are there?**

**Q. What are the submission deadlines?**

The CFP submission deadline is July 11th, with the final version of the
presentation material due September 15th 2009.

**Q: Who is allowed to submit presentations?**

A: Original authors may submit presentations for consideration. Third
party representatives such as PR firms or Speaker Representatives MAY
NOT submit materials on behalf of a potential speaker.

**Q: Why aren't Third Parties such as PR Firms allowed to submit
presentations?**

A: Due to potential copyright and intellectual property liability issues
as well as the need for OWASP to have direct contact with potential and
selected presenters to expedite selection and deliverable materials, we
require that only original authors of presentations submit for the Call
for Papers. Third party representatives such as PR firms or Speaker
Representatives MAY NOT submit materials on behalf of a potential
speaker.

**Q: Are there any restrictions on the content of the presentations?**

A: Yes, all presentations must respect the rules defined in the OWASP
[Speaker Agreement](Speaker_Agreement "wikilink").

accepted or denied?**

A: Submitters will be notified of the status (acceptance or denial) on
August 7th 2009.

**Q. Is there an honorarium for presenters?**

No. OWASP is committed to making its conferences available to the widest
possible audience. In order to do this OWASP keeps the entrance free for
the AppSec Brazil 2009 to make the conference accessible. As a result we
are unable to provide a monetary honorarium but we welcome our speakers
as our guests to the conference where they can network with other
security professionals. We will provide lodging and domestic air travel
for one presenter for each selected work.

**Q: I have been accepted. What are the materials that I have to turn in
and what are the deadlines?**

A: The following is a list of materials that are required from each
accepted presentation. Failure to proceed these materials by the
deadlines set forth for the event the presentation was accepted for will
result in cancellation of acceptance.

  - A confirmed [Speaker Agreement](Speaker_Agreement "wikilink") (July

included on the conference web site but they are not required. If you
have written an existing white paper to go along with your presentation,
please submit it with your CFP submission. Submissions with attached
White Papers will receive additional consideration.

**Q: What if I have a co-author who is not presenting. How do I cite the
person(s)?**

A: All co-authors and works that have been used should be cited in a
detailed bibliography that will be published on the Conference CD.

**Q: I have been accepted and would like to add co-presenters. Can I
still do this?**

A: No. Co-presenters should have been added at the time that the

if they register as any other participant.

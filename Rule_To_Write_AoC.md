## First: check the Index

[Here](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v2_Table_of_Contents)
you can find an updated index of the OWASP Testing Guide v2.

  - If you think you can contribute to write an article, please send an
    email to our
    [ml](http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-testing).
  - Then, I'll add yuor name in the Index page.

## Second: create a Wiki account

To write a paragraph you have to create your own wiki account.Look at
the top of this page and create it.
We want to use all the power of the Wiki model to work as a group. So
I'd like to create several teams (that can be made also by one person
only), each working on a particular subject directly online. Following
this approach, I can review and monitor all the works in "real time":
I'll be noticed when someone write a paragraph and I will be able to
keep track of all improvements.

## Write a paragraph

You can write directly a draft, then click on "watch the page" and
monitor the page, so you can add your idea soon. If you're getting
started, please review the [Tutorial](Tutorial "wikilink") for guidance.

When you write an article it is important to remember the following
things:

  - You must contribute with knowledge you have acquired from your
    work/research experience or through books or through any other
    source (Google, Wikipedia) as long as this source is reliable.
  - Everything you write must be original (we don't want to be sued for
    copyright infringement).
  - Make sure that anything you write is correct and from a [neutral
    point of
    view](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view)
  - Begin by giving a definition or description of the topic in
    question. Avoid [fallacies of
    definition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_definition).

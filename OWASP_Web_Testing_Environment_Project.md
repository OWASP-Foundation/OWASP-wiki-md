<p>OWASP WTE, or OWASP Web Testing Environment, is a collection of application security tools and documentation available in multiple formats such as VMs, Linux distribution packages, Cloud-based installations and ISO images.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The OWASP WTE project is an enhancement of the original <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Live_CD_Project">OWASP Live CD Project</a> and expands the offering from a static Live CD ISO image to a collection of sub-projects. Its primary goal is to</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'' <strong>Make application security tools and documentation easily available and easy to use.</strong> ''</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>At its heart, OWASP WTE is a collection of easy to use application security tools and documentation. WTE has a variety of ways to distribute them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Virtual Machines for VMware, VirtualBox and Parallels</li>
<li>Invidividual Debian packages (.deb) which attempt to be Linux disto agnostic.
<ul>
<li>Tested against Ubuntu, Debian, Mint, Kali, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A bootable ISO image</li>
<li>Hosted on various Cloud providers</li>
<li>Ala Carte mix-and-match installations for special purposes</li>
</ul>
<p>The project is focused at providing a ready environment for testers, developers or trainers to learn, enhance, demonstrate or use their application security skills. It's been an active OWASP project since 2008 and has had over 300,000 downloads.</p>
<p>Beyond the collection of tools from OWASP and other security projects, OWASP WTE has begun producing and including its own security tools, especially where there were no existing tools which fit a particular need.</p>
<h2 id="licensing">Licensing</h2>
<p>OWASP WTE is free to use. Its licensing is dependant on several factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>OWASP WTE created documenation is licensed under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 license</a>, so you can copy, distribute and transmit the work, and you can adapt it, and use it commercially, but all provided that you attribute the work and if you alter, transform, or build upon this work, you may distribute the resulting work only under the same or similar license to this one.</li>
<li>OWASP WTE created software and tools are licensed under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPLv3</a> or later license. You are free to use and modify this software as well as having the right to re-distribute this software as long as any changes you've made are contributed back to the project under the same license. For questions, see the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html">GPL FAQ</a></li>
<li>OWASP WTE packaged software and documentation is under the license of that project and/or software. The only licensing constraint required by OWASP WTE is that the software it makes packages of must be free to redistribute.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, you can use and share OWASP WTE as much as you want. The only time you may have an obligation is when you modify and redistribute OWASP WTE. If you are unsure, please ask the <a href="https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-wte">OWASP WTE Mail list</a></p></td>

# FAQs

**Question: What is the login (aka username and password) for the VMs?**

**Answer:**
The default username and password for the OWASP WTE VMs is *owasp* and
*owasp*. Obviously, if you're going to run this for any period of time
or in a situation more then a host-only VM, update the password for the
*owasp* user to something long and random. Regrettably, I have to set
something as a default and owasp/owasp seems like a sensible thing. The
owasp user has sudo privileges if you need to do admin tasks, update
software, etc.

**Question: How to I update my OWASP WTE VM?**

**Answer**
The OWASP WTE VMs ship with a OWASP WTE repository already configured.
The same process you use to update the base OS (Xubuntu) will also
update the OWASP WTE pacakges. Beyond the GUI tools, you can do the
following in a terminal:

    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get upgrade

**Question: What are the project's goals**

**Answer**
The overarching goal for this project is to make application security
tools and documentation easily available. I see this as a great
complement to OWASP's goal to make application security visible.

The project has several other goals going forward:

1.  Provide a showcase for great OWASP tools and documentation
2.  Provide the best, freely distributable application security tools in
    an easy to use package
3.  Ensure that the tools provided are as easy to use as possible.
4.  Continue to add documentation and tools to the OWASP Live CD
5.  Continue to document how to use the tools and how the tool modules
    where created.
6.  Align the tools provided with the [OWASP Testing
    Guide](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Testing_Project)

There were also some design goals, particularly, this should be an
environment which is

  - easy for the users to keep updated
  - easy for the project lead to keep updated
  - easy to produce releases
  - focused on just web application testing - not general Pen Testing.

(For general Pen Testing, the gold standard is [Kali
Linux](http://www.kali.org/).)

[Original SoC
Goals](http://mtesauro.com/livecd/index.php?title=Original_SoC_Goals)
are still available for the curious.

# Project History

The OWASP WTE project was originally started to update the previous
[OWASP Live
CD 2007](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Live_CD_2007_Project).
The project met the September 15th, 2008 deadline for the OWASP Summer
of Code (SoC) and produced its first release - the SoC release. Since
the completion of the SoC, the project has made the following releases:

  - OWASP WTE Oct 2013
  - OWASP WTE Oct 2012
  - OWASP WTE Sept 2011
  - OWASP WTE Feb 2011
  - OWASP WTE Beta (January 2010)
  - the AppSec EU release (May, 2009)
  - the Portugal release (Dec 12, 2008)
  - the AustinTerrier release (Feb 10, 2009)

In addition to creating these releases of the OWASP Live CD/OWASP WTE,
the maintainer has created a Linux package in Debian format (.deb) for
each tool and the documentation included with OWASP WTE. This allows the
WTE packages to be installed ala carte on Ubuntu, Debian, Mint, and
other .deb based Linux distributions.

For historical purposes, the original application for the SoC is
available

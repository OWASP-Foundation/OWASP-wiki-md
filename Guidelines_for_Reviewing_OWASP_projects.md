**`THIS``   ``ARTICLE``   ``IS``   ``A``   ``DRAFT`**` `

This page will contain detailed guidelines for OWASP Project reviewers
(usually part of a Season of Code initiative or when a project is
reviewed according with the Project Assessment Criteria):

  - Be reasonably easy to use
  - Include online documention built into tool (based on required user
    documentation)
  - Include build scripts that facilitate building the application from
    source (Goal: One-click build)
  - Publicly accessible bug tracking system established, ideally at the
    same place as the source code repository (e.g., at Google code, or
    Sourceforge)
  - Be run through Fortify Software's open source review (if
    appropriate) and FindBugs.
  - When approved to be Release Quality: Update the link to it on: the
    OWASP Project page and update its project quality tag on its project
    page to be Release Quality.

**a review undertaking consists at least in the following tasks.**

1.  Make sure that the project’s roadmap has been accomplished,
2.  Having into account which was the project’s status target (Quality
    Status in this case), check project stage/features against the OWASP
    Assessment Criteria,
3.  Point out scientific/technical and methodological mistakes, propose
    paths to follow, propose tools and documentation/bibliography to be
    studied and consulted.

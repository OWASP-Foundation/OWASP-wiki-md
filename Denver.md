\== Sponsorship == We can't do what we do alone, its takes a concerted

sponsoring an upcoming chapter meeting or event, please reach out to
Serge Borso: serge 'dot' borso 'at' owasp.org. The OWASP foundation, as
well as the Denver chapter, is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization;
**your sponsorship is not only greatly appreciated but is considered a
tax deductible donation**.

## About the chapter

The Denver OWASP chapter is comprised of Denver metro area (and beyond)
professionals and is constantly evolving. In the early years, our
chapter meetups consisted of <b>3-5</b> people talking about appsec in a
donated meeting space. From there we have migrated to holding meetings
of <b>15-25</b> people at the Hosting.com building in Denver, to
<b>30-40</b> people on the Community College of Aurora campus, to maxing
out capacity at the Chinook Tavern as well as Dave & Busters (on many
nights). The Denver OWASP chapter is focused on our security community,
and discussing advances in technology that impact us all.


Chapter Meetings are held the 3rd Wednesday of designated months, see
the [MeetUp.com](http://www.meetup.com/Denver-OWASP/) site for regular
updates and meeting information.
A large part of why 100+ people regularly attend our meetings is due to
our presenters (spectacular networking with intelligent individuals
coupled with great food and drinks certainly helps). As such, we are
always looking for talented speakers ready to share interesting
information on a wide variety of topics: Please reach out to Denver
OWASP President Serge Borso: serge 'dot' borso 'at' owasp.org if you are
interested in presenting at one of our regular meetups.

## Submit your presentation

If you are interested in presenting at a regular chapter meeting please
submit the following information to serge 'dot' borso 'at' owasp.org:
Presentation Title, Presentation Abstract and Speaker(s) BIO. The
Information Security field is very broad and essentially any information
security topic is welcome including: New and exciting research,

technology/trends, etc.

## Developing Secure Java Applications with ESAPI

**Instructor:** Fabio Cerullo ![150 px](Cerullof.jpg "150 px")

Fabio helps customers around the globe by assessing the security of
applications developed in-house or by third parties, defining policies
and standards, implementing risk management initiatives, as well as
providing training on the subject to developers, auditors, executives
and security professionals.

As a member of the OWASP Fundation, Fabio is part of the Global
Education Committee whose mission is to provide training and educational
services to businesses, governments and educational institutions on
application security, and has been appointed OWASP Ireland Chapter
Leader since early 2010.

He holds a Msc in Computer Engineering from UCA and has been granted the
CISSP & CSSLP certificates by (ISC)2.

### Course Language

**The course will be delivered in SPANISH (español)** with simultaneous
translation in English (if necessary).

### Course Overview

Training Audience: Technical
Required Skill Level: Intermediate
This course aims to provide the knowledge and resources required to
improve the security of Java applications using the OWASP Enterprise
Security API (ESAPI) Libraries. These libraries are designed to make it
easier for developers to retrofit security into existing applications,
and also serve as a solid foundation for new development.

### Course Contents

The participants, through theory and labs, will be able to identify
critical vulnerabilities in web applications and implement the necessary
corrective measures using the ESAPI libraries.

Topics Include:

\- Introduction to ESAPI Architecture
\- Security Controls Overview
\- Authentication
\- Session Management
\- Access control
\- Input validation
\- Output encoding/escaping
\- Cryptography
\- Error handling and logging
\- Data Protection
\- HTTP security
The class is hands-on and will include labs. Attendees should have a
laptop capable of running VMs. We will provide a VM at the beginning of
the class.



## Advanced Vulnerability Research and Exploit Development

<span style="color:red">UPDATE: THIS TRAINING HAS BEEN CANCELLED DUE TO
LOW REGISTRATION NUMBERS </span>

## Hands on Web Application Testing: Assessing Web Apps the OWASP way

Instructor: Matt Tesauro ![Matt-Tesauro.png](Matt-Tesauro.png
"Matt-Tesauro.png")

Matt Tesauro has worked in web application development and security
since 2000. He has worn many different hats, from developer to DBA to
System Administrator to Penetration Tester. Matt also taught graduate
and undergraduate classes on web application development and XML at
Texas A\&M University. Currently, he's focused on application security
risk assessments at Praetorian. Outside work, he is the project lead for
the OWASP Live CD / WTE, a member of the OWASP Foundation board, and
part of the Austin OWASP chapter leadership. Matt Tesauro has a B.S. in
Economics and a M.S in Management Information Systems from Texas A\&M
University. He is also has the CISSP, CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker),
RHCE (Red Hat Certified Engineer), and Linux+ certifications.

### Course Abstract

The goal of the training session is to teach students how to identify,
test, and exploit web application vulnerabilities. The creator and
project lead of the OWASP Live CD, now recoined OWASP WTE, will be the
instructor for this course and WTE will be a major component of the
class. Through lecture, demonstrations, and hands on labs, the session
will cover the critical areas of web application security testing using
the OWASP Testing Guide v3 as the framework and a custom version of
OWASP WTE as the platform. Students will be introduced to a number of
open source web security testing tools and provided with hands on labs
to sharpen their skills and reinforce what they’ve learned. Students
will also receive a complementary DVD containing the custom WTE training
lab, a copy of the OWASP Testing Guide, handouts and cheat-sheets to use
while testing plus several additional OWASP references. Demonstrations
and labs will cover both common and esoteric web vulnerabilities and
includes topics such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL injection, CSRF
and Ajax vulnerabilities. Students are encouraged to continue to use and
share the custom WTE lab after the class to further hone their testing
skills.

<td><p><strong>Building Security Into Frameworks: Who is doing it right</strong>. In this talk, Jerry Hoff, VP of the Static Code Analysis Division at WhiteHat Security, will discuss the importance of security controls in mobile and web frameworks. The talk features a tour through a spectrum of languages and frameworks. A tip of the hat will be given to frameworks and security controls that demonstrably mitigate vulnerabilities, resulting in more secure code. A wag of the finger will be given to frameworks that either lack essential security controls, or implement them improperly.</p>
<p>Many of the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and their corresponding security controls will be discussed. Participants will walk away with a better understanding of the security libraries available across a wide array of popular web technologies.</p>
<p>Jerry Hoff is the VP of the Static Code Analysis Division at WhiteHat Security. Prior to joining WhiteHat, he was a co-founder and managing partner at Infrared Security. Jerry has worked at a number of fortune ten financial firms, along with years of hands-on security consulting, where he specialized in manual code review, web application penetration testing, and architecture reviews. Jerry also has years of development and teaching experience. He taught for over seven years at Washington University's CAIT program, and the microcomputer program at University of Missouri in St. Louis. Jerry is the writer/producer of the popular OWASP Appsec Tutorial Series and the lead developer for the WebGoat.NET project.</p></td>

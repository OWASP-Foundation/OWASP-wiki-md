## The Presentation: Poor Man's Guide to Breaking PKI: Why You Don't Need 200 Playstations

The commercial PKI system is designed to provide web site validation
services that stand up to the threat of DNS spoofing and other
man-in-the-middle attacks against web sites. This presentation addresses
weak points in commercial PKI and discusses ways for clients to defend
against an attack on a commercial certificate authority resulting in
trusted certificates falling into the hands of attackers.

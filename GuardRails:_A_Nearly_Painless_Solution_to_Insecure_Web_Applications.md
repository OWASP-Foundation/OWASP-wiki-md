\== The presentation ==

![Owasp_logo_normal.jpg](Owasp_logo_normal.jpg
"Owasp_logo_normal.jpg")With web applications continuing to grow in
popularity and frameworks becoming simpler to use, creating a web
application is easier than ever. While building an application may be
straightforward, ensuring that it is secure requires both a deep
understanding of subtle security vulnerabilities as well as tedious and
careful insertion of security checks. We propose GuardRails, a
source-to-source tool for Ruby on Rails applications that adds extra
layers of security to web applications with only minimal effort from the
developer. GuardRails works by attaching security policies to the data
itself. These policies are automatically enforced throughout the
application, without the need for the developer to write large amounts
of code. Our system helps prevent against a variety of security
vulnerabilities from Cross-Site Scripting to faulty access controls
without requiring the developer to have a sophisticated knowledge of web
security.

## Adopt OSS. First Edition

OWASP Italy is pleased to announce a new initiative: **Adopt**
**O**pen**S**ource**S**oftware
Given OWASP’s mission to help organizations with application security,
we have established a new initiative to provide free, voluntary-based
support to open source software projects.
Thanks to Adopt OSS, security enthusiasts are paired with participating
open source projects, thus gaining exposure to real-life security
engineering challenges and the opportunity for career growth. In turn,
the participating projects are able to obtain free professional
expertise to better improve their security posture, and ultimately build
secure software. Over a six months period, OWASP Italy will facilitate
the effort by coordinating the initiative and providing support when
needed.
The first edition of this initiative will take place between *May and
November 2015*, and will see the participation of **7 OWASP Italy
members** and **3 major OpenSource projects**. At the end of the six
months period, OWASP Italy will publish results and feedback from both
volunteers and OSS maintainers.
The official flyer can be [downloaded from
here](https://www.owasp.org/images/0/07/AdoptOSSManifest-OWASPItaly.pdf).

### Ntopng

*Alessio Petracca, Mattia Folador, Giuseppe Longo*
[Ntop](http://www.ntop.org/products/traffic-analysis/ntop/) is the
de-facto standard for real-time network traffic monitoring. OWASP Italy
wants to help the project by increasing the security level of ntopng,
performing security testing activities and supporting the remediation
process.
We will act in two steps:

  - First, a penetration test targeting the web interface of ntopng will
    be performed, following the [OWASP Testing
    Methodology](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Guide_v3_Table_of_Contents)
  - Secondly, source code review of ntopng main components (such as the
    C++ core engine) will be statically reviewed. The objective is to
    address all relevant checks contained within the [OWASP Code Review
    Guide](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Code_review_V2_Table_of_Contents)

In case the activities above are completed before the end of the
six-months period, additional activities (such as the development of
security plugins) will be discussed. Luca Deri and Arianna Avanzini will
support Alessio Petracca and Mattia Folador in these activities, by
providing guidance and insights.

### WordPress

*Paolo Perego, Sandro Zaccarini*
[WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) is the facto standard for web
publishing. If you need a blog, if you need a new showcase website for
your portfolio or a tiny e-commerce web site for your small company you
will look at WordPress to start.
Paying the cost to be the boss, WordPress during the years suffered tons
of security issues, 3 major issues only in the beginning of May 2015.
Either the core, plugins and themes are developed with easy to use in
mind and they need to be hardened.
OWASP Italy wants to support WordPress adopting it with the "Stand by
WordPress" initiative. We will deploy the software in three different
standard configurations: blog, company's portfolio and e-commerce.
We will do continuous appsec during development of 4.3 version in order
to quickly spot security issues before the August release. In addition,
we will take care of hardening guidelines and both plugins and themes
subsystems in order to improve the overall architecture.
You can follow the progress of the "Stand by WordPress" initiative here:
<https://standbywordpress.wordpress.com>

### GlobaLeaks

*Luca Carettoni, Giovanni Cerrato, Marco Lancini*

[GlobaLeaks](https://www.globaleaks.org/) is the first open-source
whistleblowing framework. It empowers anyone to easily set up and
maintain an anonymous whistleblowing platform.
Considering the potential hostile environments in which the application
may be hosted, security vulnerabilities and abuses are primary concerns
for GlobaLeaks’ maintainers.
We want to help the team in their excellent application security
practices, by performing vulnerability research activities in order to
discover unknown bugs within the boundaries of their specific [threat
model](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1niYFyEar1FUmStC03OidYAIfVJf18ErUFwSWCmWBhcA/pub).
In particular, we will be focusing on two main software components
(GLBackend and GLClient) and new security-relevant changes (upcoming
authentication re-factoring and end-to-end encryption).

### Nov, 2007 - sqlmap v0.5

Bernardo Damele and Daniele Bellucci have released the fifth versions of
the tool [sqlmap](http://sqlmap.sourceforge.net). sqlmap is an automatic
SQL injection tool entirely developed in Python. It is capable to
perform an extensive database management system back-end fingerprint,
retrieve remote DBMS databases, usernames, tables, columns, enumerate
entire DBMS, read system files and much more taking advantage of web
application programming security flaws that lead to SQL injection
vulnerabilities.

You can download the latest stable version from its [SourceForge File
List
page](https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=171598&package_id=196107)
or the latest development version from its [SourceForge SVN
repository](https://sqlmap.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/sqlmap).

### Dec, 2006 - sqlmap v0.2

Bernardo Damele and Daniele Bellucci have released a second version of
the tool "sqlmap" for Automatic Blind SQL Injection.
[Here](http://sqlmap.sourceforge.net/) you can download the tool

### September, 2006 - Wisec Project

Stefano Di Paola is developing Wisec - The Wiki Security Project
[Here](http://www.wisec.it) you can accesses the project.

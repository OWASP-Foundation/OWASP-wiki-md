# Main

Security of SCADA is great challenge and WEB-applications play huge role
in it. The Project aims to research modern SCADA security issues,
related to WEB-applications security used in vendors solutions (ICS,
SCADA, RTU, PLC, equipment for industrial networks and etc.). According
to the statistics, one of the most popular remote attack vectors on
SCADA is fingerprinting of exposed industrial devices by its front-ends
and server-side components through application procols (HTTP, UPnP,
SNMP, FTP, SSH, Telnet). It helps the hackers to detect critical
infrastructures, as well as signatures of smart-metering devices, HVAC,
medical devices. The idea os the project is to gather information about
the ways of improving the security measures in modern ICS environments
and to create guidelines for it's hardering.

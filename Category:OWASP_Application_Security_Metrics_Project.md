#### Main

## Welcome to the Application Security Metrics Security Project

This OWASP Project will first identify and provide the OWASP community a
set of application security metrics that have been found by contributors
to be effective in measuring application security. This will be followed
by the development of new metrics that build on the initial metrics
foundation to fulfill unmet metrics requirements. The goals of this
Project are to make a baseline set of application security metrics
available to the OWASP community and subsequently to provide a forum for
the community to contribute metrics back into the baseline.

## Project Guiding Principles:

The Application Security Metrics Security Project Project’s Guiding
Principles were created in order to express the intentions of its
contributors when designing application security metrics.

  - Effective security metrics have proven to be challenging to develop.
    As such, provide a means for the OWASP community to initially
    leverage what others have developed and find useful (i.e., provide
    the OWASP community useful metrics in use today).

<!-- end list -->

  - Where practical, attempt to “standardize” nomenclature with other
    security metrics initiatives such as securitymetrics.org, Systems
    Security Engineering Capability Maturity Model (SSE-CMM), etc.

<!-- end list -->

  - In selecting best practice metrics, make use of high-level filters.
    For example, use Dr. Dan Geer’s decision support mantra regarding
    security metrics: “How would that proposed measure advance
    appropriate decision making?"

<!-- end list -->

  - Link each metric to the business driver for the metric (e.g., Metric
    “X” helps support regulatory compliance and risk management
    objectives.”

Comments to the editor or endorsements are welcome.

## Project Scope:

In keeping with OWASP’s mission, this project will focus primarily on
application security metrics. Below are some resources with information
on application security metrics.

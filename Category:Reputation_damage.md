Financial damage is when profitable companies have a cash flow problem
which impacts the business to generate profits to cover the company’s
debt. A company’s financial damage has a domino impact to its industry.
The reputation of the company reflects badly, the industry takes a hit,
competitors gain your customers, and in some cases legal action is
brought against the company.

## Background and Motivation

**History Behind Project** WebGoat is a teaching tool designed to teach
web application security lessons. Each lesson, users must demonstrate
their understanding of a security issue by exploiting a real
vulnerability in the application. Why the name "WebGoat"? Developers
should not feel bad about not knowing security. Even the best
programmers make security errors. What they need is a scapegoat, right?
Just blame it on the 'Goat

**Problem to be Addressed** WebGoat needs to be updated with more
lessons. Since there are new attacks that are not covered yet in the
current set of lessons like HTTP splitting and AJAX attacks. Also, there
are uncompleted lessons which does not make WebGoat look professional
enough for OWASP users. Some lesson plans also needs to be written. In
addition to that, WebGoat needs to be integrated to SiteGenerator.

**Benefit to OWASP Members and Community** Provide OWASP users with
full, complete and professional tool that would teach them most of the
web application attacks. The tool can be used as a professional
educational tool for security novices.

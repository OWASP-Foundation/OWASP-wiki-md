### As part of my responsibilities as a board member:

1.  I have read and acknowledge the [Board Code of
    Conduct](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Governance/Board_Code_of_Conduct),
    included in the appendix
2.  I will interpret the organization’s work and values to the
    community, represent the organization, and act as a spokesperson.
3.  I will attend at least 75% of board meetings annually (at least 3 of
    the 4 scheduled quarterly meetings)
4.  I will act in the best interests of the organization, and excuse
    myself from discussions and votes where I have a conflict of
    interest.
5.  I understand that I have a fiduciary duty to act in an objective,
    responsible, honest, trustworthy, and efficient manner without
    placing the organization under unnecessary risk. As part of this
    duty, I will act for the good of the organization, rather than for
    the benefit of myself or my employer.
6.  I will stay informed about what’s going on in the organization. I
    will ask questions and request information.
7.  I will participate in and take responsibility for making decisions
    on issues, policies and other board matters.
8.  I will work in good faith with staff and other board members as
    partners towards achievement of our goals.

If I don’t fulfill these commitments to the organization, I will expect
the board chair to call me and discuss my responsibilities with me.

### In turn, the organization will be responsible to me in several ways:

1.  I will be sent, without request, quarterly financial reports and an
    update of organizational activities that allow me to meet the
    “prudent person” standards of the law.
2.  Opportunities will be offered to me to discuss with the executive
    director and the board chair the organization’s programs, goals,
    activities, and status; additionally, I can request such
    opportunities.
3.  Board members and staff will respond in a straightforward fashion to
    questions that I feel are necessary to carry out my fiscal, legal
    and moral responsibilities to this organization. Board members and
    staff will work in good faith with me towards achievement of our
    goals.
4.  If the organization does not fulfill its commitments to me, I can
    call on the board chair and executive director to discuss the
    organization’s responsibilities to me.

Signed:

The OWASP Foundation will use the following policy when approving
financial transactions or entering into contracts or other agreements
requiring a financial commitment by the Foundation, to ensure financial
transparency and achieve operational independence from board members:

  - Financial obligations and transactions up to $10,000 USD - single
    signer (Executive Director primary, Operations Director secondary)
  - Financial obligations and transactions more than $10,000 USD and up
    to $50,000 USD - dual signer (Executive Director and Board
    Treasurer)
  - Financial obligations and transactions more than $50,000 USD - Dual
    signer (second signer MUST be a board member), and notice given to
    the entire board of directors
  - Dual Signers - If Executive Director is not available, 2nd Board
    member can sign in her place.
  - Additionally, where the board treasurer is not authorized on our
    European account, the board can assign oversight responsibility for
    our European account to another member. Currently Seba has oversight
    of our European account and accounting practices and will be the
    second signer for European Transactions.

explicitly authorized (as detailed above) are authorized to sign legally
binding contracts on behalf of the OWASP Foundation. Exceptions may be
granted in certain circumstances, but volunteers and other 3rd Parties
must receive written authorization from an authorized signatory before
entering into contracts on behalf of the Foundation.</span>

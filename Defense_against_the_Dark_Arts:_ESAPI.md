It has been said that software engineering is 10% engineering and 90%
art. Given the same set of technical specifications, two engineers will
have drastically different methods of addressing those specifications.
This is the beauty of innovation and forward thinking, and while it is
this type of creative problem solving that has kept the technical
industry lurching forward in large strides – it is also the boon of
application security. Enter the Enterprise Security API – a central
repository for engineers to solve security concerns in application code.
I have said many times that it should not be the responsibility of the
engineers cranking out code every day to design security controls. It is
difficult to remain on the bleeding edge of Application Security and
Software Engineering at the same time and even more difficult to bring
these two disciplines together into a cohesive, reusable component that
addresses the threats specific to an organization.

This course will illustrate the importance of having an Enterprise
Security API and how to effectively design, build and deploy a solution
that addresses the Threat Model of the single application or enterprise
application portfolio.

\==Description== **Course Length: 2 Days**

Today, every business function relies on custom software applications.
These applications are typically built under tremendous time pressure by
internal or contracted developers to fulfill a specific business need.
Organizations need to be able to trust that this software has
appropriate security mechanisms to thwart attacks and that the code does
not contain vulnerabilities. Even software product companies have an
extremely difficult time achieving trustworthy code, and experience
shows that most custom applications have far more vulnerabilities.
Recent market trends show a clear pattern: organizations need an
Application Security Initiative in order to achieve this level of trust
in their custom-built applications.

In this two-day management session you’ll get an industry perspective of
application security, understand the key vulnerabilities to
applications, be able to analyze root cause, and provide practical and
proven techniques in building out an application security initiative.
This course gives executives and managers the education and practical
guidance they need to ensure that software projects properly address
security. The course is designed to provide a firm understanding of the
importance of software security, the critical security activities
required within the software development lifecycle, and how to
efficiently manage security issues during development and maintenance.
This understanding is reinforced through industry awareness, live
demonstrations of commonly found application vulnerabilities and
workgroup exercises allowing attendees to conduct capability assessments
and recommend improvement plans.

## Student Requirements

None.

## Objectives

Skill: Basic Training

1.  Be aware of secure application development and the value it brings
2.  Be able to compare your project with other comparable companies
    efforts in application security
3.  Understand that application security risks and their associated
    business risks need to be identified for all applications
4.  Be aware of the key security areas and understand the major threats
    to each
5.  Understand application security root causes, analyze an
    organization’s capability and utilize proven techniques in
    planning and managing an effective application security initiative.
6.  Understand how to successfully integrate secure coding activities
    and techniques across the application development lifecycle
7.  Be able to determine whether their team has the appropriate skills
    to build a secure application, and how to build teams with the
    required skills.
8.  Be familiar with common application security tools and technologies

    they provide

## Instructor

'''Instructor: ''' Aspect Security has been working with development
teams around the country for years to help them identify, diagnose, and
address security issues throughout the application development
lifecycle. Through these efforts, they have learned the key practices
that development and project managers, and key support personnel must
know to achieve secure applications.

Aspect’s instructors are full-time application security specialists that
spend the majority of their time working with clients to secure the
nation’s most critical applications. Leveraging this practical
experience brings the class to life. Students will gain valuable insight
into lessons learned from other development organizations. Our
instructors also make themselves available to you for application
security questions after the course is complete.

Aspect is a Founding OWASP Member and supports several OWASP projects.
In particular, Aspect conceived the OWASP Top Ten project and led the
effort to build the document. We also built WebGoat and Stinger and
donated them to the OWASP effort. Aspect personnel assist with the
management of the OWASP Foundation and help run the OWASP AppSec
conference series.

## Featured Item: OWASP Employee \#2, Paulo Coimbra

  - Paulo Coimbra (following his recent sucess of managing Spoc 07) as
    accepted to become the 2nd OWASP employee (he will be working
    part-time until June and full time from then on). Paulo will take on
    the role of OWASP Project Management, and here are his first
    short-term action plan:

<!-- end list -->

1.  To launch and manage the new season of code – OWASP Summer of Code
    2008.
2.  To contribute to and stabilize OWASP’s new Project Assessment
    Criteria.
3.  To contribute to the assessment, and re-assessment, of all OWASP
    projects.
4.  To build and maintain a wiki page with the status of all OWASP
    projects and their assessments.
5.  To welcome new developers who are interested in joining OWASP
    community.
6.  To help project leaders and participants with their projects in any
    way that I can.

## Featured Item: Proposed OWASP Project Assessment

  - OWASP has begun the process of stabilization its [**PROJECT
    ASSESSMENT
    CRITERIA**](:Category:OWASP_Project_Assessment "wikilink"). The
    objective is to have clear and objective requirements for OWASP
    project's (for both tools and documentation).
      - The current structure is still in flux, so please spend some
        time reviewing it and send us your comments.
      - The objective is to map all [OWASP
        Projects](:Category:OWASP_Project "wikilink") to the proposed 3
        project modes (Release Quality, Beta Quality and Alpha Quality)
        in the next couple months.

## Featured Project: OWASP Spring of Code 2008 is about to be launched - March 3rd

  - OWASP is about to launch the [**'OWASP SUMMER OF CODE
    2008**'](OWASP_Summer_of_Code_2008 "wikilink") (SoC 2008). This
    follows the successfull OWASP Spring of Code 2007 (SpoC 07), in
    which 21 projects were sponsored with a budget of US$117,500, and
    the OWASP Autumn of Code 2006 (AoC 06), in which 9 projects were
    sponsored with a budget of US$20,000.
  - The SoC 2008 is an open sponsorship program were
    participants/developers are paid to work on OWASP (and web security)
    related projects.
  - The SoC 2008 is also an opportunity for external individual or
    company sponsors to challenge the participants/developers to work in
    areas in which they are willing to invest additional funding.

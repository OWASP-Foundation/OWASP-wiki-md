Keynote

Using the framework described in my book “Software Security: Building
Security In”---built around the three pillars of software security: risk
management, the touchpoints, and knowledge---I will discuss and describe
the state of the practice. This talk is peppered with real data from the
field, based on my work with several large financial services companies
as a Cigital consultant. Really, the software security field is just
getting started, but we are making important forward progress, and the
future looks bright.

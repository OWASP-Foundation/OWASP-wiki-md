## Overview

We are surrounded by open source software. Not only the open source
software all of us use, also many of the commercial applications contain
open source libraries. Think of server and desktop software, but don't
forget routers, cars, phones. Open source is everywhere.

The OWASP Open Review Project (ORPRO) exists to act as a resource
providing automated static analysis of OWASP projects.

Fortify Software has made their [Fortify on Demand (FoD)
technology](https://www.fortify.com/products/fortify-on-demand/index.html)
available to OWASP projects at
[owasp.fortifyondemand.com](http://owasp.fortifyondemand.com).

## Project Goals

  - Provide an independent security review of OWASP projects with a
    record of what has been reviewed and by whom in order to best
    communicate the security state of the projects. At the current time
    this includes automated review of OWASP project code
  - Engage in responsible disclosure of any security vulnerabilities
    discovered

## Project Planning

  - Settle overlap between OWASP projects: August 2008 (completed)
  - Initial tool selection and implementation: September 2008
    (completed)
  - Roll out automated review capabilities for a limited set of
    projects: September 2008 (completed)
  - First reviews: October 2008
  - Shutter original project:June 2011
  - Re-start project using Fortify on Demand rather than Fortify SCA:
    August 2011

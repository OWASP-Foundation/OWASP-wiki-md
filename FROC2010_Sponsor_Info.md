# Sponsor Information

  - Registration is from 7:30 to 8:30 in the sponsor room along with
    continental breakfast.
  - Our area will open at 7:00am so you can begin setting up anytime
    after that.
  - There is no mandatory set up time but if you want to attend any
    sessions or talk to prospects it may be a good idea to set up during
    registration.
  - Be sure to bring a fishbowl and raffle item. OWASP does not
    distribute the attendee list but you will get plenty of cards.
  - Please visit the [conference
    site](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Front_Range_OWASP_Conference_2010#tab=Welcome)
  - Please [register](http://froc2010.eventbrite.com/) your people so we
    can keep an accurate count. Also review the
    [agenda](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Front_Range_OWASP_Conference_2010#tab=Agenda)
    page to see the flow.
  - Auraria campus does not have a dock for deliveries so you will need
    to bring your items with you. This is a table top venue so you donâ€™t
    need a booth.
  - Any additional questions, please email me at kthaxton@hosting.com

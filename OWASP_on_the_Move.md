# About

This program allows local chapters to have OWASP presenters on site.

It is NOT for speakers to attend OWASP conferences.

This program allows 3 parties to find each other:

  - Local chapters events that want to attract an OWASP speaker
  - OWASP speakers to entertain OWASP presentations and that want to see
    the world
  - OWASP sponsors that want to support spreading the OWASP message

To find available speakers in your area, see the [OWASP Speakers
Project](:Category:OWASP_Speakers_Project "wikilink")

## Application Process

The way it works is really easy.

  - Upfront the chapter leader logs an OOTM request (event details, who
    to cover, etc...) [Here](http://sl.owasp.org/contactus) The request
    will be reviewed by the OWASP Staff. If the request is within the
    rules (see below) it will be rapidly approved.
  - The speaker, who made the travel/lodging expenses, submits a
    reimbursment request with receipts after the presentation is
    performed
  - The Reimbursmement is approved and processed.

That's it\!

## OWASP On the Move Rules:

The following rules apply for the OotM project:

  - Primary funding would be deducted from the [local chapter
    budget](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Donation_Scoreboard).
      - A chapter without sufficient funds for a speaker may request the
        Global Chapter Committee vote to approve the use of OWASP funds.
  - The normal maximum amount per speaker is 500 USD
  - Only in special circumstances the maximum amount per speaker can be
    raised to a maximum of $1000 USD
  - There is a proposed limit of 2,000 USD on the amount of $ provided
    to any individual per year (\*see 'further funding' below)
  - There is a proposed limit of 2,000 USD on the amount of $ provided
    to any chapter per year(\*see 'further funding' below)

A chapter can use the sponsorship 4 times a year, with a maximum of 2
speakers sponsored by OotM for one single event.

  - Further funding: for active chapters or speakers who have reach the
    proposed financial limits, further funding is possible but will
    depend on available budget, since priority would be given to
    chapters below these thresholds

OWASP on the Move funds are not to be used by speakers to attend OWASP
conferences. If assistance is needed to attend a conference, contact the
conference chair.

The payments are tracked online

This article addresses data security controls implemented in software
features or development processes. Data Security is the name given to a
group of controls within the U.S. National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) *Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure
Cybersecurity* (the Cybersecurity Framework). Subcategories within this
category include:

  - Data at rest is protected
  - Data in transit is protected
  - Protections against data leaks are implemented

Other administrative, operational and architectural controls are
included as well, but the above list specifies measures that would be
directly reflected in the coding of software features.

NIST Special Publication 800-53 lists additional related controls within
the System and Communications Protection family, which comprises 41
controls in total. Depending on the relevance in a given project, there
are at least six of these that could be implemented directly as software
features and map back to the Data Security category in the Cybersecurity
Framework, including:

  - Information in shared resources
  - Denial of service protection
  - Transmission confidentiality and integrity
  - Cryptographic protection
  - Transmission of security attributes
  - Protection of information at rest

These controls are implemented through means such as the proper use of
cryptography, [software security
architecture](Web_Services_Architecture_and_Security "wikilink"), [error
handling](Error_Handling,_Auditing_and_Logging#Error_Handling "wikilink"),
and processing labels applied to data.

ISO 27001:2013 includes controls related to data security within the
System acquisition, development and maintenance group.

In recent years, we have witnessed a growing number of enterprises and
government agencies suffer data breaches. While organizations are
buffing up their security layers—which is important—most of the focus is
on preventing direct threats that come from outside, while detecting
threats from within is neglected.

In this talk we will present our research data. Our data shows that
insider threats, whether attributed to malicious, negligent or
compromised insider, go unnoticed by common security tools. In order to
detect insider attacks we suggest a mixture of Behavior Analytics and
Deception technology. These technologies were deployed in several
production environments. We then collected data from these environments
and discovered different forms of insider threats in each and every
deployment. Our data suggests that organizations are already
experiencing some form of insider attack which current security
technology does not address.

1Password is one of the most popular Password managers in the world.

The most important quality for tools in this category is the level of
trust that they provide us when we let them guard our most sensitive
data.

In this talk we will explain (and demonstrate) several flaws in the
design of 1Password’s architecture, that could potentially be exploited
and put our sensitive data which is stored there at risk.

We will also explain several flaws which have already been disclosed,
and give some recommendations for how to use Password managers in a
safer way.

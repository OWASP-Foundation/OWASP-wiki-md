## Submission Response

*Latest first*

### Final version

*Grouped into single response, each with its own "About OWASP*

**'Promoting Business Compliance**'

*BC1. Why do businesses not use guidance more often, and what can we do
to encourage them to?*

Much guidance is not easy to find and often it has to be paid for. The
OFT should promote access to high-quality free standards, guidance and
procedures.

This official response has been submitted on behalf of the Open Web
Application Security Project (OWASP) by the OWASP Global Industry
Committee, following our own consultation process.

OWASP is a worldwide free and open community focused on improving the
security of application software. Our mission is to make application
security "visible", so that people and organizations can make informed
decisions about application security risks. OWASP has three active
chapters in the UK:

  - Leeds/North <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Leeds_UK>
  - London <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/London>
  - Scotland <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Scotland>

Everyone is free to participate in OWASP and all of our materials are
available under a free and open software license. Further information:

  - Legislation, standards, guidelines, etc referencing OWASP
    <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Industry:Citations>

*BC2. How can we make guidance on existing and future consumer
protection regulation more accessible and user friendly (for example,
are there exemplars we could follow and is there a specific location
where guidance should be held such as Directgov, the OFT website, etc)?*

OWASP produces a range of comprehensive, expert-reviewed, standards,
guidance documents, code libraries and tools for organisations
designing, developing and operating websites and web applications. Some
key ones are:

  - Top Ten - The Ten Most Critical Web Application Security Risks
    <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project>
  - Development Guide
    <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Guide_Project>
  - Code Review Guide

  - Testing Guide <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Testing_Project>

  - Software Assurance Maturity Model

All the output is available free-of-charge to anyone without
registration, and printed copies can be bought at cost. The materials
are so well regarded, they are referenced by many other national and
international standards such as PCI DSS:

Much of the documentation is aimed at development and verification
staff, but SAMM is much more aligned with the governance of such
matters, and the Top Ten specifically discusses issues for website
owners.

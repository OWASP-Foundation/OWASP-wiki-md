## OWASP Conference Dinner - Optional Event - April 9th

The OWASP Conference committee hopes that all of you will join us for
dinner and a social gathering after at the Wheatsheaf Hotel in nearby
Surrey. <http://www.wheatsheafhotel.com/index.html>

We have arranged for a coach to take up to 50 people from the school to
the hotel and back on Saturday night. We have also arranged for a
pre-fix dinner at the hotel (menu choices listed below). Since the coach
can only take about half the people that have signed up for the
conference, be sure to reserve your seat right away.

The coach will be leaving Royal Holloway at 7 PM to arrive at 7:30 for
the dinner. After dinner we can hang out in the bar. The coach then
leaves the hotel at 11 PM and gets back at 11:30.

The following payment options will allow you to pay for the meal with or
without the coach. Drinks are additional at the restaurant. You MUST pay
for your meal **by April 7th** in order to join our group. We received a
two day extension from the hotel.

After you make payment, you must **send us an e-mail** at
<conferences@owasp.org> indicating which starter and which meal you want
(see below) as we have to inform the restaurant on April 8th of what the
choices are.

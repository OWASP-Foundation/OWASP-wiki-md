The experience 8 is a very early draft of Paulo playing around.Looks
like we've got a good start on getting the templates needed for criteria
v2

We discussed the questions – Matt had sent a draft to Dinis & Paulo.
Paulo will put it on a Google Doc and share with the committee
(Google Form's first version
<https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/owasp.org/viewform?formkey=cjlOaW95ZXBfLWdNeTZnYURrbzFKSFE6MA>..\]

Conversation about the thread that happened on the Leaders List

  - Throw back a bone – perhaps make the stipen smaller
  - Perhaps do the boiling frog method to wean the OWASP off stipens –
    slowly decrease the stipens to zero
  - Break issue into
      - Do we pay stipens?
      - If so, how much do we pay?
  - Are we paying for work product or are we paying for something to be
    done (a recievable)?
  - Eventually OWASP would be removed from the handling they payment of
    project leads – instead sponsoring companies would handle this.
  - Make OWASP like the Google Summer of Code
  - OWASP value add is the promotion and sponsorship of the project.
  - OWASP goes from paying for someone's time to paying to get the guy's
    job done
      - Pays to make sure the guy can get things done
      - Be enablers to the project leads
      - You shouldn't be out of pocket (cash) while doing your project
  - OWASP should be paying for everything from your time
  - Lots of discussion here.
  - Next thing to work on – additional funding for the SoC
  - How is this going work – how to get external support/sponsors?
      - Can we ge a couple more memberships for OWASP?
      - Brad was tasked with mapping this out
      - <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Season_of_Code_Sponsorship>
      - <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Funds_available_for_OWASP_Projects>
        (this project is completely out of date)
      - Brad gave an example of the code guide at his company
      - There were sponsorships for 2007
        <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Spring_Of_Code_2007>
      - This was part of their membership fees
      - Could propose 40% of your membership fees toward a project when
        a company becomes a member
      - Say “you become a member, we'll give you a class based on the
        class pack”
      - Paulo sent the link to Jason's survey
        results:<https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/owasp.org/ccc?key=pJzNU1yNJd7VBH1bS6rY0EQ&hl=en>
        and
        <https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/owasp.org/ccc?key=rHFvhU15v3S3myFqSWQVXyg&hl=en>
      - Value we provide is that OWASP sits in the middle of the
        community and do the facilitation

      - Plan for how we are going to get the maximum visibility for the
        SoC launch -
          - Blogs, press pack, podcasts, how to disseminate the news
          - Hook Pravir about how to launch this like OpenSAMM
              - Made some good deals with his launch – need to do the
                same
              - Viral gorilla type marketing

<!-- end list -->

  - How to get committees to fill out the details of their areas
      - Start pushing questions to the committees

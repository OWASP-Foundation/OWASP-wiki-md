the holes in your defenses.

Synopsis: This presentation will show how to integrate a compliance
framework into application security testing to produce an effective
mechanism for presenting risk. Regulations, including security breach
notification legislation, HIPAA, FISMA and other regulations specify
penalties for failing to safeguard specific types of information. This
presentation will demonstrate how to weave regulatory frameworks into
the application testing process and how to quantify risk based upon
penalties and ease of exploitation. Using real world examples, the
presenters will show how this methodology can be used to justify
security testing as a necessary expenditure for a secure environment.

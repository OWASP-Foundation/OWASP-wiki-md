"Owasp_logo_normal.jpg")Looking at the source of an application that's
over 100k lines of code can be an overwhelming experience. With out
having a practical plan of approach, it's easy to get lost and not
provide a comprehensive review of the application.

This talk will outline a variety of strategies that help focus and guide
the reviewer through the challenges faced in source code auditing.
Specific topics will cover comprehensive code reviews, auditing for
specific vulnerabilities, design review, hybrid approaches, and the
OWASP code review guidelines.

Additionally, a new strategy for source code review will outlined to
provide a practical means of focusing a code review effort.

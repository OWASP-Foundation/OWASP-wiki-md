## Old Business

All active board proposals are listed
[here](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BxSfMVkfLvslVXdvUFV3NkxucWc&usp=sharing)

  - Item 1: Discuss and confirm Date & Time for September Board meeting
    during AppSec San Francisco, so meeting room & A/V can be scheduled
      - Recommend Friday evening, Sept.25 18:00 - 20:00 like in
        Amsterdam. Wiki currently says Saturday, July 26.

<!-- end list -->

  - Item 2: Review Bylaws Section 3.02 per Fabio email. Discuss if
    appropriate to change. Vote as needed.
      - Fabio recommendation: The election terms needs to be reviewed in
        my opinion.. at present it reads "An individual is limited to 4
        consecutive 2 year terms” \>\> I think we need to change the
        statement to the following “An individual (member?) is limited
        to be elected no more than three terms in any 7 years period”.
        By doing so we reinforce the message that you need to be an
        OWASP member to run for the Board and also are limiting the
        scope in amount of years which is quite currently long in my
        opinion.
      - (Paul still looking for current editable version of Bylaws in
        Word or Google Docs. Checked with Bil, Andrew, Jim. May need to
        use current pdf)

<!-- end list -->

  - Item 3: Carry-over from June 24 meeting.
      - Review of [Bylaws
        DRAFTv7](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RnVbx6DXX3tGcFWlrSxyn8NDKPQEYbTcACJR0oCuyaI/edit#heading=h.rye1xpr37ksy)
        as proposed by Andrew.

## New Business

All active board proposals are listed
[here](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BxSfMVkfLvslVXdvUFV3NkxucWc&usp=sharing)

  - P.Ritchie - Update & Action plan for AppSec-EU Conference 2016. [Ops
    & Planning team
    recommendation](https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/document/d/1jcHr1vMaFudtiCOue7J-ACxzYiFunLHB03yBWkszCGM/edit?usp=sharing)

      - Vote needed? Past Year's AppSec Conf. selections did not require
        Board vote. This is update based on broader Planning team and
        greater Staff engagement in decision process, due to no Chapter
        Volunteers or proposal by mid-year deadline.

  - P.Ritchie - Board Discussion and Action on Dinis Cruz recommendation
    as follows: Request for OWASP Board to approve $100K for a Project
    Summit in 2016, and then ask for a team of OWASP leaders to apply to
    lead that effort. Per June 26, 2015 email. Discussion topic - What
    actions, if any, to take on this

  -
  - P.Ritchie - Handling issues of Commercialization creeping into
    presentations, trainings, chapter meetings, etc. Paul recommends
    Staff take this on at the ED & Community Mgr level to do first level
    communication and reminder of OWASP Policy. Continued abuse or
    disagreement would be taken to Compliance officer, but first level
    communication should be in professional, collaborative manner from
    Staff.

\>\> Goal is to confirm with Board that this operating guideline is
acceptable with the 2-3 cases brought to our attention this month.

  - For Action - [Approve minutes from June 24 Board
    meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1flUHQfne84BXixhnEAozXy8OrfX8Fx2Ch73kkLwQGes/edit)

  - \[Michael\]

      - Proposal - Motion to move primary responsibility of planning and
        execution of the AppSecUSA 2016 conference to the OWASP
        Foundation. Selection of core conference themes and
        speaker/proposal would be driven by the owasp community.

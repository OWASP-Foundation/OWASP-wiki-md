## The talk

The presentation will be about the PHPIDS and how this system might be
capable solving several security dilemmas of developers and site owners.
Such as:

  - Complexity of the webapp security topic vs. time pressure
  - Diversity of attack patterns and techniques
  - Costs for nowadays security solutions
  - Obfuscated exploits vs. Blacklisting
  - Techniques to detect attacks based on algorithms
  - Massive usage of regular expressions vs. performance

The talk is potentially interesting for either security professionals,
developers and project managers since the meaning and whereabouts of the
PHPIDS will be introduced - as well as some regular expression black
magic the system uses.

An important part of the presentation will be about possibilities to
detect attacks without blacklists or other dictionary based techniques
but by the plain buildup of the string.

The presentation is based on a white-paper about the PHPIDS - which can

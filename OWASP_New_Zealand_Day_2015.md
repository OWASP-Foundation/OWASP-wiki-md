# Introduction

## Introduction

We are proud to announce the sixth OWASP New Zealand Day conference, to
be held at the University of Auckland on Friday February 27th, 2015.
OWASP New Zealand Day is a one-day conference dedicated to application
security, with an emphasis on secure architecture and development
techniques to help Kiwi developers build more secure applications.

Similar to last year:

  - We will be offering training on the day before the conference
    (Thursday, 26th of February).
  - After lunch on the conference day, we will split to two tracks - one
    focused on technical topics, the other on policy, compliance and
    risk management.

The sixth OWASP New Zealand Day will be happening thanks to the support
provided by the University of Auckland, which will kindly offer a
slightly different location from the last five years. Entry to the event
will, as in the past, be free.

For any comments, feedback or observations, please don't hesitate to
contact
[us](mailto:kim.carter@owasp.org?cc=adrian.hayes@owasp.org?cc=denis.andzakovic@owasp.org).

# Speakers List

## Speakers List

### Kirk Jackson - Xero - Applying OWASP Top 10 to ASP.NET MVC projects

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

What's the OWASP Top 10, and how do we defend against those threats?
Advances in web platforms and frameworks make it easier to defend
against common web attacks. By introducing the defences available in
ASP.NET MVC we'll see how we can make our lives easier (and more
secure\!).

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Kirk Jackson is Security Officer at Xero, and has presented at previous
OWASP, Kiwicon and other developer conferences.

### Francois Marier - Mozilla - Integrity protection for third-party JavaScript

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

Modern web applications depend on a lot of auxiliary scripts which are
often hosted on third-party CDNs. Should an attacker be able to tamper
with the files hosted on such a CDN, millions of sites could be
compromised. Web developers need a way to guarantee the integrity of
scripts hosted elsewhere.

This is the motivation behing a new addition to the web platform being
introduced by the W3C: sub-resource integrity
(http://www.w3.org/TR/SRI/). Both Firefox and Chrome have initial
implementations of this new specification and a few early adopters are
currently evaluating this feature.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Francois is a senior software engineer in the Mozilla Security & Privacy
team where he spends his time working on new ways to protect Firefox
users. By night, he contributes to Debian and other free software
projects.

### Adam Bell - Lateral Security - Defaced: An insight into methodologies, tools and motivations

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

"The internet is a hostile place, particularly if you are a charitable
organisation.

Websites are compromised and defaced on a daily basis and sometimes
their owners need a little help getting to the bottom of what happened.

So what if your website has been compromised and is getting reports of
abuse... How do you react? What can you do?

This talk will cover a recent incident response and investigation I
carried out and describe how you, as the developer-in-charge of an
all-in-one webhost can investigate and respond.

Based on a true story, this talk will describe the incident response
methodology I used, take a look at some of the tools that the defacer
had left behind and give an insight into the badguys mindset and
motives."

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Adam Bell once ate a jam sandwich. He lives in Auckland with his newly
spawned hacker progeny and fears the day she learns to pop shell. By day
he is a security consultant for a prominent boutique security company,
by night he tries to remember what sleep is.

### Pedro Worcel - Security-Assessment.com - CMS Hell

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

We all know about Wordpress and its (in)security. What about other
CMSes? What about NZ made ones?

Introducing 'droopescan', a plugin-based tool for scanning CMSs. In this
talk we will see its effectiveness in identifying versions and plugins,
and we will see how the landscape looks like for installations of two
CMSs (Drupal & SilverStripe) in New Zealand.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Pedro is a security researcher for Security-Assessment.com, with more
than five years of experience in IT. I have a strong background on web
applications, and generally enjoy building and hacking software of all
kinds.

### Nick von Dadelszen - Lateral Security - Lazily Finding Holes Without Breaking The Law

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

Why risk actively testing for security vulnerabilities in websites when
a large amount of vulnerabilities can be passively found? Based on an
event where a major security issue was found in a potential client's
site just through passive browsing during a scoping exercise, we
thought, why not always be scanning? So, enter some dodgy nickvd style
code and quick fixes, a little more polished code from feabell, and you
have a system that is continuously passively scanning everything you
browse. The vulnerabilities just come to you. This is the true lazyman's
way to find vulnerabilities, and could be used to check a large number
of sites for some common issues in a quick and painless manner.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

A regular in the NZ security industry, Nick has now clocked up his 15th
year of penetration testing. With a full security team at Lateral
Security to keep in check, his time is now more commonly spent in
meetings and reviewing reports. However, he still loves to jump in and
get his hands dirty, especially when it is something new and
interesting. Origin: New Zealand

### Benjamin Kearns - Lateral Security - Crypto 101: A "no crazy maths" guide to crypto vulnerabilities

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

While less common that other types of security vulnerabilities
encryption flaws can often have a very high impact. Some big
applications, hardware and frameworks have been vulnerable to simple
encryption flaws in recent years.

This talk with run you through a variety of crypto flaws which we've
observed in web and mobile applications over the last couple of years.

It will show you how to exploit them and discuss how to protect
yourself.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Ben works as a Security Consultant for Lateral Security. He has two and
a half years of security experience which is backed by a further five
years of IT experience, primarily spent developing web applications and
administering Linux systems.

### Chris Smith - Insomnia Security - PHP Magic Tricks: Type Juggling

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

PHP is a magical language\! Unfortunately, magic leads to unexpected
behaviour and unexpected behaviour leads to security bugs. This talk
will go over a specific magic trick that PHP performs as a loosely- and
dynamically-typed language.

The trick is type juggling, a set of rules that PHP enacts when trying
to compare different types together. Given the different possible ways
you might want to compare different data, you'd expect there to be some
unexpected behaviour in there. You'd be right. And, given the importance
of the comparison operator for enforcing security controls, you'd expect
that to lead to some tasty bugs. You'd be right.

You will be introduced to PHP's various type juggling rules and how you
might want to exploit them in security-critical areas of modern
applications. We'll also look at a few publicized bugs that exploit this
functionality and then finish off on how you can avoid exposing yourself
to these issues. It'll be as easy as 'abc' == 0, I promise.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Chris is a consultant for Insomnia Security where he breaks other
peoples stuff and writes reports about it. Previously a Linux sysadmin
and polyglot developer, he now exacts his revenge on technologies that
have wronged him.

### Andrew Kampjes and Mike Haworth - nil and Aura - Surprise Features in Your Favourite Framework

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

Modern web frameworks allow developers to be productive, however they
are feature rich and not every feature is well understood. Some of these
features can work in unexpected ways and can be leveraged by attackers.
This talk will look at some of the gotchas in popular frameworks. We'll
also look at the ways popular features such as social logins can go
wrong.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Andrew Kampjes enjoys getting under the hood of Rails and playing with
its quirks. He also gets a sick satisfaction finding security flaws in
other’s code.

Mike Haworth is a Principal Security Consultant for AuraInfoSec, he
spends his days doing everything from Red Team engagements to Code
Reviews.

### Jamie Anderson - SafeStack - Thinking Securely: Practical Advice for Developers

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

If there’s one lesson that we can learn from 2014, it’s that security
needs to become a priority for any web-based application. The challenge
for developers is that they don’t think the same way that security
professional do. They don’t see the holes until it’s too late.

As someone who has experienced both sides of the story, I have found a
few ways to help to bridge this gap. In this talk I will share my story
as well as a few tips and tricks I've learned along the way so that
developers like me can think more securely and write more secure
software.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Jamie has spent a decade and a half writing software, ranging from
desktop software to back-end services to web-based applications. He has
recently joined the information security community and is now a secure
development specialist for SafeStack.

### Andrew Kelly - Insomnia Security Group Ltd - The Fall and Rise of InfoSec

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

A talk with a beginning, a middle ... and a 'will it ever end?' at the
end. A light-hearted, albeit with a serious message somewhere, skip and
jump through three decades of collected wisdom and anecdotes on the
'fall' of InfoSec with the rise of viruses, worms, etc., in the 80's and
90's - and its subsequent 'rise' again in the 2000's due to hacking and
similar nefarious activities now being 'accepted' as mainstream.
Changing attitudes in the last 30 years - but not changes in music and
fashion - will be covered; alongside some ideas on how you can use such
changes to your advantage in your own careers and/or organisations. All
this by a man who (he claims) has done the hard yards: All nine of
them\!

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Andrew is the Operations Manager for Insomnia Security, and a man in the
twilight years of his working life. 2015 marks his 27th in Computer
Security, Data Security, IT Security, Cyber Security and/or Information
Security (and his 30th in IT), and he reckons he's fogotten more than he
ever knew about most things - including InfoSec. Andrew now spends most
of the short ime left to him now reminiscing about the old days,
wallowing in past glories ... and wondering why kids today just don't
understand.

### Aloysius Cheang - Cloud Security Alliance - Securing the Cloud to the Internet of Things

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

CSA's Software Defined Perimeter (SDP), a next generation security
architecture for virtual private clouds, hardened SaaS, BYOD and
Internet of Things (IOT), is explained. CSA is disrupting network
security by making networks dark and adapting innovations from top
secret systems. We will deep dive into the reference architecture,
review enterprise implementations and discuss the future of SDP and IOT
through the looking glass of the CSA.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Aloysius Cheang is Managing Director APAC of Cloud Security Alliance. He
also heads up the Standards Secretariat. Aloysius brings to the CSA
extensive experience gained from running business units and
multi-million enterprise security and technology programs for Global 500
organizations worldwide in his previous roles as a global CSO for a
leading Telco and as APAC practice leaders for leading management
consulting firms. He is an active community leader, having founded and
mentored various information security projects, forums, groups and
associations in Singapore and globally. He is also active in
standardization and was most recently a co-editor for ISO/IEC 27032

Master’s degrees in Computer Science from the National University of
Singapore with professional certifications such as CISA, CISSP and GCIH.
His views are valued by global media such as Times, Wall Street Journal
and CIO Magazine as a trusted independent source of specialist opinion
over the last 15 years.

### Chris Esther - Confide Ltd - Joined up PCI DSS : A systematic approach to PCI DSS v3 compliance

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

In this presentation I will eschew the list of requirements approach to
compliance and will reframe the PCI DSS using a systems approach to
provide a holistic view of its requirements. The key processes and their
linkages will be identified, including:

  - Scoping
  - Vulnerability management
  - Configuration management
  - Change management
  - Development
  - Testing

Similarly the core information required by PCI DSS will be identified
and relationships between them discussed, including:

  - Cardholder data flow diagram
  - Network diagram
  - Configuration Management Database

If you are new to PCI DSS it should provide a solid foundation for
understanding it. For those already being embraced by PCI DSS it may
provide another perspective that should help when managing the increased
evidential requirements of PCI DSS V3.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Developer background, qualified lawyer, QSA. Currently providing
advisory and compliance services to commercial and government
organisations focusing on PCI DSS and privacy.

### Carlos Cordero - Security among those who keep your secrets: comparing security in a top competitive intelligence services

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

Firm A is the Latin American equivalent of IDC, Gartner, or Forrester
but Peruvian. Firm B started as a top New Zealand market research firm
and is now part of a top 5 multinational market research corporation.
Both companies provide research services to enterprise corporations,
Firm A to practically every well know IT vendor which operates in Latin
America and Firm B to New Zealand and Australian corporation in the
Financial, FMCG, Telecom, Media, and other critical industries.
Therefore, both firms hold commercially sensitive information about the
goals, intentions, activities, and plans of their clients. Both also
have contracts with some of said clients to protect such information.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Carlos is a commercial and intelligence practitioner in the IT industry
and a full member of the IITP despite not having a computer science
degree but a business management one. Prior to New Zealand, founding
partner of an intelligence firm which counts as clients vendors such as
Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, IBM, HP, Dell, Telefonica, Telmex, AT\&T,
Siemens, to name a few. Also was an elected leader of the Peruvian
equivalent to NZ Tech.

### James Healy - Stoic Limited, apprentice at SafeStack - Handling Vulnerability Disclosure in New Zealand

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

As a security researcher, reporting security issues to businesses and
organisations can sometimes get dicey. As a company you need a
disclosure policy in place, and a plan for what happens
post-disclosure.. Especially if you've just had your private emails and
photo's from 2011's Christmas do (oh dear..) posted on Twitter. This
talk applies to companies of all sizes and addresses planning, right
through to patching and publication.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

James researched malware and packers during his teen years before moving
onto web application security and development. For the past year he's
been a C\# developer at CourierPost and recently started an
apprenticeship at SafeStack. He's also a freelance developer pretending
to be from a large company called Stoic Ltd when in fact it's just him
making websites. He enjoys beer and coffee. You should probably buy him
one of those. James is also a little weirded out writing a bio in
third-person.

### Training Abstract - Bootstrapping Agile Security

Agile development is often seen as a delicate balance of ritual and
roles allowing for rapid development, continuous deployment and the
expansion of the post-it note industry. Security is often seen as a
lumbering giant of process, governance and technology allowing for
increased control, reduced risk and the expansion of the technology
vendor industry.

What if you could merge the two?

The world of security is changing to meet the needs of agile software
development. Organisations around the world are coming up with tools,
techniques and processes to make security a continuous presence to
support developers. This hands on, fast-paced course will not only give
students a solid grounding in how to bring security into agile software
development life-cycles, but also give a range of tools, techniques and
practical skills to make it happen.

# Call For Sponsorships

## Call For Sponsorships

OWASP New Zealand Day 2015 will be held in Auckland on the 27th of
February, 2015 and is a security conference entirely dedicated to
application security. The conference is once again being hosted by the
University of Auckland with their support and assistance. OWASP New
Zealand Day 2015 is a free event, but requires sponsor support to help
be an instructive and quality event for the New Zealand community. OWASP
is strictly not for profit. The sponsorship money will be used to help
make OWASP New Zealand Day 2015 a free, compelling, and valuable
experience for all attendees.

The sponsorship funds collected are to be used for things such as:

  - Refreshments (coffee break/lunch) - we want to keep people refreshed
    during the day; while we certainly bring good and interesting
    speakers, we don't want people to go home when they become hungry.
  - Name tags - we feel that getting to know people within the New
    Zealand community is important, and name tags make that possible.
  - Promotion - up to now our events are propagating by word of mouth.
    We would like to get to a wider audience by advertising our events.
  - Printed Materials - printed materials will include brochures, tags
    and lanyards.

## Facts

In 2013, the event was supported by six sponsors and attracted more than
250 participants. Plenty of constructive (and positive\!) feedback from
the audience was received and we are using this to make the conference
more appealing to more people. For more information on the last New
Zealand Day event, please visit:
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2013>

The OWASP New Zealand community is strong, this year has Christchurch as
a new region and there are more than 360 people currently subscribed to
the mailing-list. OWASP New Zealand Day is expected to attract between
250 and 300 attendees this year.

OWASP regular attendees are IT project managers, IT security managers,
IT security consultants, web application architects and developers, QA
managers, QA testers and system administrators.

## Daily Notes

  - 2006-12-20: Added three new vulnerabilities and built new installers
    and updated links on the OSG project page.
  - 2006-12-17: Added two new vulnerabilities (hard-coded password and
    sensitive data through error messages) into OSG.
  - 2006-12-16: Finished up the web services integration and got Hacme
    all the way integrated into OSG. Checked in all code.
  - 2006-12-10: Worked on integrating OSG with Hacme so that web
    services could be used as an example.
  - 2006-12-1 thru 2006-12-5: Worked on a bug in the altova product that
    was holding up progress on SiteGenerator. I created a hack around it
    as this bug can't be fixed with out the source code.
  - 2006-11-26 - Added some documentation to the ORG project page.
  - 2006-11-24 - I fixed a few bugs related to the new version of the
    Altova component
  - 2006-11-19 - I finished up another round of bug-fixes and
    refinements for the installer. I need to get Dinis' okay and then it
    can be released.
  - 2006-11-15 - Mike realized that he keeps forgetting to update this
    page.. so whips himself with a wet doughnut. Also, created the first
    version of the ORG installer. Before this he has fixed quite a few
    bugs in ORG which can be found on the ORG project area.
  - 2006-10-03 - Finished up the communication channel for the
    SiteGenerator.
  - 2006-10-04 - Fixed a few bugs Dinis reported to me.
  - 2006-10-07 - Started work on the documentation and created initial
    screen shots. Cleaned up the code removed the global variables and
    old code that was not being used anymore. Added in a configuration
    file to use instead of some of the static values that were entered
    in the global variable class. This way users can modify it without
    having to recompile the code. Added in the ability to remove
    projects. Cleaned up the UI as well a little bit.
  - 2006-10-08 - Finished up the initial version of the new
    documentation. Fixed a few small GUI bugs and checked in all of my
    code.
  - 2006-10-10 - Created the installers for the new version of
    SiteGenerator and released them to SourceForge, updated the links on
    the SiteGenerator page.
  - 2006-10-14 - Fixed a few bugs in the installer and the SiteGenerator
    over all.
  - 2006-10-15 - Added in a prompt for saving unsaved data when closing
    a form. Added in drop downs for the short and long-term
    recommendations in the recommendations database screen.
  - 2006-10-23 - Upgraded the Altova component

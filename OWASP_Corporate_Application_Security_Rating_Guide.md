OWASP is building a directory of public application security claims from
a variety of organizations. All the information referenced must be on
the company's public website or some other reputable source of
information, such as a public interview of the company's CSO.

Note this is a survey of what companies are **claiming** not what they
actually do. The purpose is to gain insight into how the software market
is changing. In addition, we hope that this effort will encourage
organizations to disclose their application security practices.

## Characteristics

Organizations have been rated on the following five characteristics:

  - 1\. The organization has established an ongoing application security
    awareness and training program.
    The training program must ensure that software developers,
    architects, and testers have been exposed to application security
    and understand how to find and prevent the common vulnerabilities.
    Leaders and managers must also be trained in how to lead projects
    and teams to produce secure applications.

<!-- end list -->

  - 2\. The organization defines security requirements for each
    application.
    The organization must define application security requirements for
    each application based on understanding of the threat model for the
    business. These requirements are used to drive security through the
    software development process and are verified as part of the testing
    and acceptance processes.

<!-- end list -->

  - 3\. The organization verifies the security of all applications.
    All of the company's applications (including internal applications)
    receive some level of scrutiny to verify security and check for
    common vulnerabilities before they are deployed and at least yearly
    thereafter. The most critical applications must receive a detailed
    code review and penetration test, while less critical applications
    must receive at least an automated security scan.

<!-- end list -->

  - 4\. The organization has established a dedicated application
    security team.
    The organization has an application security team that provides
    expert application security support to development projects across
    the software development lifecycle. In particular, the team helps
    with security requirements, threat modeling, architecture reviews,
    code reviews, and penetration testing.

<!-- end list -->

  - 5\. The organization has established a clear process for responding
    to security issues.
    The organization will provide a working point of contact for all
    application security issues. The organization must have a defined
    process for handling issues through their conclusion, and they must
    follow the process.

## Scoring

Each organization has been rated according to the following scheme:

  - Full (2 points)
    All parts of the characteristic are specifically mentioned in the
    public materials.

<!-- end list -->

  - Partial (1 point)
    Some of parts of the characteristic are mentioned in the public
    materials.

<!-- end list -->

  - None (0 points)
    The public materials have been thoroughly researched and do not
    demonstrate that characteristic

<!-- end list -->

  - Unknown (0 points)
    The claims on this subject have not yet been investigated

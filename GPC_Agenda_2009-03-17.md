# Minutes

  - Coveras' proposal decision will be postponed until SoC. We need to
    have an understanding of the opportunity costs of investing in this
    proposal in terms of our ability to support other projects
  - Google Application will be posted to the wiki
  - Project surveys will be sent out ASAP
  - Email to leaders list will includ mentioning orphans up for adoption
  - How do we establish guidelines/rules of
    engagement/governance/criteria/etc for anything in OWASP that's not
    a project? Is that even really our jurisdiction?
  - Is there another category for OWASP Projects?
  - People will move to new mailing list global_projects_committee but
    history will remain with old list; old mailing list will remain for
    a brief time to catch any stragglers
  - When projects metadata is gathered, another piece of data will be
    whether project is mature enough to support local chapter training
  - Establishing rules for governance of OWASP will be considered for
    the future

"Fail safely" gets redirected to a page with the heading "Fail Securely"
(but still named "Fail_safely"). It seems someone thought "Fail
Securely" is a better phrase for the principle than "Fail safely", but
the change needs to be propagated to this page (and possibly on other
pages).

I'd fix it myself but there is no page named "Fail_securely" and I
don't want to make a mess of things for others -- I'm just visiting this
site for the first time and don't have a feel yet for how it's being
setup and maintained - I don't want to ruffle any feathers, but am
trying to help...

`  Thanks Chris - I updated the main principle page to list "Fail Securely"`
`  instead of "Fail Safely."  There is a page called`
`  `<http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Fail_securely>`.  MediaWiki`
`  leaves behind any pages that are renamed with a redirect`
`  to the new page, so that any old links get to the right place.`

## Application Security Principles

Why is Principles immediately limited to Application Security
Principles? Aren't other kinds of principle relevant?

## Proven principles

This page refers to "proven" principles. What counts as a proof - a
self-appointed guru wrote it somewhere, a statistician has done a
detailed meta-analysis of the literature, or what?

## Secure Coding Principles and CLASP

The Secure Coding Principles and CLASP principle duplicate principles
already listed in the table of contents. Suggest they be removed from
the ASDR and have the contents of the Secure Coding Page and CLASP page
referenced in each the corresponding ASDR principles. --Cduffey346

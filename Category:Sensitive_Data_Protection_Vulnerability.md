This category is for tagging vulnerabilities that lead to insecure
protection of sensitive data. The protection referred here includes
confidentiality and integrity of data during its whole lifecycles,
including storage and transmission.

Please note that this category is intended to be different from access
control problems, although they both fail to protect data appropriately.
Normally, the goal of access control is to grant data access to some
users but not others. In this category, we are instead concerned about
protection for sensitive data that are not intended to be revealed to or
modified by any application users. Examples of this kind of sensitive
data can be cryptographic keys, passwords, security tokens or any
information that an application relies on for critical decisions.

Examples of this vulnerability can be:

  - Information leakage results from insufficient memory clean-up
  - Inappropriate protection of cryptographic keys (This should also be
    labeled with Category:Cryptography)
  - Clear-text Passwords in configration files (This should also labeled
    with Category:Authentication if the passwords are used for
    authentication.)
  - Lack of integrity protection for stored user data

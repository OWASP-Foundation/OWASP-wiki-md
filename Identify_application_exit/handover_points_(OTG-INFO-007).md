## Summary

Some applications defer functionality to other existing applications. A
common example of this is the payment gateway. Many application owners
don't wish to incur the cost and hassle of maintaining their own
application payment gateway, so they leverage existing payment gateway
providers to handle payments for their applications.

## Test Objectives

The objectives of this test case are:

  - to clarify the scope of the test, and
  - to understand the state/circumstances of normal termination of the
    application, and
  - to observe what parameters and information is exchanged during the
    application handover.

'''Welcome the the OWASP Project Reboot Page: '''

*What is the OWASP Project ReBoot initiative?*

OWASP needs to refresh, revitalize & update its projects. We need to
make the software development community more aware of our efforts and
demonstrate the foundations library of solutions & guidance designed to
help with the secure application development lifecycle.

The proposal for this initiative is here:

**[Project Re-Boot
Proposal](https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/file/d/0B5Z9zE0hx0LNSUZvOWVKd1JRWnlVaGJMcjB3SEN3Zw/edit)**

**Project Lead**: Eoin Keary
**Proposal Approval Team**: Jim Manico, Rahim Jina, Tom Brennan,...
[Reboot_Review_Criteria](Reboot_Review_Criteria "wikilink") (For
review team)

Board Approval can be seen here:
[1](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/May_14,2012)

To that end we have a budget to fund various project related activities.
We hope putting some financial support behind projects will re-energise
our community and hopefully deliver some great high quality material
which can be used to support software developers and testers for years
to come:

**Activity types**:
**Type 1**: Update, rewrite & complete guides or tools.
This "type" is aimed at both existing and new tools or guides which
require development effort to update, augment, rewrite, develop in order
to achieve a high quality release quality product.

Examples:
\#"Mini" Project based summits: Expenses associated with getting global
workshops, with the aim of releasing a new version of a project.
\#Paying contributors for their time and effort.
\#Paying for user guides etc to be professionally developed (technical
writing etc).

**Type 2**: Market, Training, Awareness, increase adoption.
Existing, healthy robust tools and guides can utilise Type 2 activities
to help with creating awareness and increasing adoption of that
project.
Examples:
\#Assisting with expenses associated with marketing a project.
\#Costs facilitating OWASP project focused training and awareness
events

**How are we going to fund this??**
We are requesting all OWASP chapters which are in a healthy financial
position to pledge 25% of their chapters funds to pay for this
initiative.
[Pledge some chapter funds
here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/OWASP-REBOOT)

Donate $1.00 to help save a current or future software application
[Click
Here](http://www.firstgiving.com/fundraiser/projectreboot/owasp-project-reboot)

The Foundation shall also support this initiative with additional
funding.
The goal is to accumulate a budget of $100K which shall be appointed to
projects undergoing this reboot.
[- Chapter
Funds](https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/spreadsheet/pub?hl=en_US&hl=en_US&key=0Atu4kyR3ljftdEdQWTczbUxoMUFnWmlTODZ2ZFZvaXc&output=html)

**Can I apply for this Reboot?**
You certainly can, assuming you are an OWASP member.
If you feel your project is ready or has potential you can apply for the
reboot programme.

**How does funding work?**

**Type 1**: Funding can be applied for as required if travel/mini summit
etc is to be expensed as part of the reboot. Development activities;
payment to contributors shall be at 50% and 100% milestones.
Milestones are agreed prior to project reboot initiation.
Once the 50% milestone is reached the work done to date shall be
reviewed by a member of the [-
GPC](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Global_Projects_Committee)
and also another nominated OWASP reviewer (generally an OWASP leader).
**Type 2**: Funding is supplied as required. Items to be funded are
agreed prior to reboot initiation.
Invoices for the required services are sent directly to the foundation
for payment.

**How do I apply?** Send in a proposal with the following information:

1.  Project name and description. Including reboot project lead and any
    team members.
2.  Re boot type (Type 1 or Type 2)
3.  Goals of the reboot
4.  Timeline for the 50% milestone and the 100% milestone. Suggested
    milestone reviewers (Generally OWASP Leaders or other industry
    experts)

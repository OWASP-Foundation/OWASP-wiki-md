**OWASP Brand Usage Rules**

## Philosophy

OWASP stands for informed security decisions based on a solid,
comprehensive understanding of the business risk associated with an
application. OWASP's philosophy is that achieving security involves all
parts of an organization, including people, process, and technology. We
support the use of our brand consistent with this philosophy. However,
we cannot allow the use of our brand when it implies something
inconsistent with OWASP's comprehensive and balanced approach to
application security. Therefore, we have defined these brand usage rules
to clarify appropriate and inappropriate uses of the OWASP brand,
including our name, domain, logos, project names, and other trademarks.

## Rules

The following rules make reference to the OWASP Materials, meaning any
tools, documentation, or other content from OWASP. The rules also make
reference to "OWASP Published Standards" which are currently in the
process of being developed and released. Currently there are no OWASP
Published Standards.

1.  The OWASP Brand may be used to direct people to the OWASP website
    for information about application security.
2.  The OWASP Brand may be used in commentary about the materials found
    on the OWASP website.
3.  The OWASP Brand may be used by OWASP Members in good standing to
    promote a person or company's involvement in OWASP.
4.  The OWASP Brand may be used in association with an application
    security assessment only if a complete and detailed methodology,
    sufficient to reproduce the results, is disclosed.
5.  The OWASP Brand must not be used in a manner that suggests that The
    OWASP Foundation supports, advocates, or recommends any particular
    product or technology.
6.  The OWASP Brand must not be used in a manner that suggests that a
    product or technology is compliant with any OWASP Materials other
    than an OWASP Published Standard.
7.  The OWASP Brand must not be used in a manner that suggests that a
    product or technology can enable compliance with any OWASP Materials
    other than an OWASP Published Standard.
8.  The OWASP Brand must not be used in any materials that could mislead
    readers by narrowly interpreting a broad application security
    category. For example, a vendor product that can find or protect
    against forced browsing must not claim that they address all of the
    access control category.
9.  The OWASP Brand may be used by special arrangement with The OWASP
    Foundation.

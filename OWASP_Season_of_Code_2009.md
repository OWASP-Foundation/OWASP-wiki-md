\== UPDATES ==

  - **MAY 6:** DRUM ROLL\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\! **THE
    OWASP SEASON OF CODE 2009 HAS BEEN PRE LAUNCHED AT [OWASP APPSEC
    EUROPE 2009 -
    POLAND](OWASP_AppSec_Europe_2009_-_Poland "wikilink")\!**
      - **Deadline for project release applications: TBD**

## OVERVIEW

OWASP is now launching its Season of Code 2009 (OWASP SoC 09) with a
provisional budget US$90,000, following the previous [OWASP Summer of
Code 2008](:OWASP_Summer_of_Code_2008 "wikilink"), in which 33 projects
were approved and a budget of more than US$125,000 have been made
available, the [OWASP Spring of Code
2007](OWASP_Spring_Of_Code_2007 "wikilink") (SpoC 07), in which 21
projects were sponsored with a budget of US$117,500, and the [OWASP
Autumn of Code 2006](OWASP_Autumn_Of_Code_2006 "wikilink") (AoC 06), in
which 9 projects were sponsored with a budget of US$20,000. The OWASP
SoC 2009 is an OWASP grant program to encourage participants/developers
to work together on OWASP (and web security) related projects.

### Strategic Focus

OWASP SoC 2009 introduces a shift in grant structure from previous
Seasons of Code. Going forward, we would like to see Season of Code
grants used towards operating expenses. The driving idea behind this
shift is that OWASP, as an organization, has plenty of technical talent
and knowledge. As a result, our money is best spent on things that we
cannot already do right now as an organization. These expenses include
things like marketing our best projects, printing promotional samples of
our best OWASP documents, graphic design, travel expenses to hold
mini-summits, etc.

With this goal in mind, all project proposals should include a budget
detailing how much money the team is expecting (up to 20k) and how they
plan on using those funds. While all projects will be reviewed by the
SoC Jury, preference will be given to projects that use the funds for
expenses incurred outside of the OWASP community. The SoC Jury will
provide feedback on proposals whose allocations and costs are deemed to
be too high.

Although we welcome any project proposals (from improving Quality of
[existing OWASP projects](:Category:OWASP_Project "wikilink") to new
innovative research), the areas below will be preferred:

1.  **OWASP Education Pack** - ([Education
    Committee](:Global_Education_Committee "wikilink"))
2.  **Enterprise usability of OWASP projects** - ([Projects
    Committee](:Category:Global_Projects_Committee "wikilink"))
3.  **Additional Sources of Funding** -
    ([Membership](:Global_Membership_Committee "wikilink") & [Chapters
    Committee](Global_Chapter_Committee "wikilink"))
4.  **Marketing & PR** -
    ([Industry](:Global_Industry_Committee "wikilink") & [Conferences
    Committee](:Global_Conferences_Committee "wikilink"))

In particular, any projects that wishes to participate in the current
SoC with the goal of improving their project quality is welcome to
submit an application. Several project leaders have already indicated
that they would like to do this even without SoC grant funds. For
proposals that do not request SoC grant funds, we will do our best to
offer alternative rewards in the form of project promotion (recognition,
featured placement on the OWASP website, speaking slots to highlight
projects at OWASP conferences, etc).

  - On the allocated projects areas the respective committee, above
    pointed out, will be involved on the application selection and will
    act as the 2nd reviewer accordingly with the [OWASP Assessment
    Criteria V2](:Assessment_Criteria_v2.0 "wikilink").

<!-- end list -->

  - The OWASP SoC 2009 is also an opportunity for external individual or
    company sponsors to challenge the participants/developers to work in
    areas in which they are willing to invest additional funding - see
    [OWASP Season of Code
    Sponsorship](OWASP_Season_of_Code_Sponsorship "wikilink") for
    further information.

## WHO CAN APPLY?

  - The only requirement is that the candidate(s) show the potential to
    accomplish the project release's objectives/deliveries and the
    commitment to dedicate the time required to complete it within the
    SoC deadlines.
  - Current active OWASP Project Contributors (including Project
    leaders) are encouraged to apply.
  - No member of the OWASP board or OWASP Global Projects Committee is
    allowed to apply for a OWASP SoC 09 sponsorship.
  - There are no any other restrictions on who can apply for a OWASP SoC
    09 sponsorship.

## JURY

The OWASP SoC 09 jury is constituted by the OWASP Board Members ([Jeff
Williams](User:Jeff_Williams "wikilink"), [Dave
Wichers](:User:Wichers "wikilink"), [Tom
Brennan](:User:Tbrennan "wikilink"), [Sebastien
Deleersnyder](:User:Sdeleersnyder "wikilink") and [Dinis
Cruz](:User:Dinis.cruz "wikilink")) plus respective
[Committee](:Global_Committee_Pages "wikilink") representative.

## SELECTION CRITERIA

  - The participant must create a roadmap for the project release that
    includes technical requirements, functional requirements, and
    quality requirements. Preference will be given to proposals that use
    the existing [OWASP Beta and Stable
    requirements](:Assessment_Criteria_v2.0 "wikilink") for quality
    supplemented with their own technical and functional requirements.
  - If requesting SoC grant funds, the participant must include a budget
    of anticipated expenses.
  - There are two methods to select OWASP SoC 09 project releases:
      - By direct majority vote by the Jury;
      - By selection rating using the criteria defined below.
          - Each project release will receive a rating from 1 to 5 on
            the following categories by each Jury. The final result will
            be the total value.
              - On the Project Release:
                  - Complete status - What will be the final
                    Completeness State? (According with the [OWASP
                    Assessment Criteria
                    v2.0](:Assessment_Criteria_v2.0 "wikilink"))
                  - Complexity - What is the project release Complexity
                    and Size?
                  - Member Value - How big is the potential added value
                    to OWASP Members?
                  - Brand Value - How big is the potential added value
                    to the OWASP Brand?
              - On the Candidate:
                  - Past Work - Value of past contributions to OWASP
                    Projects;
                  - Deliverability - Proven capability to deliver;
                  - Quality of Proposal - Global quality of the proposal
                    submitted.

## OPERATIONAL RULES

  - Proposals are submitted using online form (with all details publicly
    posted).
  - The participant should propose one reviewer (for details on the
    proposed reviewer responsibilities, see TDB see {assessment criteria
    reviewer role link}).
  - Each and every project release should have its SoC Project Release
    page always completely updated with all information regarding the
    project release status.
  - The SoC Project Release's final deliveries will be evaluated by the
    assigned reviewers. However, the Jury will provide final oversight.
  - Invoicing of expenses can be done directly through Alison, our OWASP
    accountant. Grants amounts will be approved by the SoC Jury.
    Participants are expected to stay reasonably close to their line
    item budgets; significant deviations or re-allocations from
    individual line items will be approved by the respective Global
    Committee managing the project so long as the deviation does not
    result in the costs exceeding the original grant amount. Any costs
    above and beyond the original grant amount must be approved by the
    SoC Jury.

## GENERAL RULES

  - By taking part on OWASP SoC 09, the participant will authorize OWASP
    to host and advertise without any limitations his participation and
    all related contents including proposal and all deliveries.
  - All tools, documentation, or any other materials whatsoever, created
    by the participants within OWASP SoC 09 context must be released
    under an Open Source Initiative approved license. However, the
    participant may mirror development on her/his personal
    infrastructure at her/his option.
  - Participants and OWASP is free to use the results, including code,
    of the SoC's 09 code in any way they choose provided it is not in
    conflict with the license under which the code was developed.
  - Any situation arising not included in the above mentioned set of
    rules will be decided according to the discretionary judgement of
    OWASP Board.

## OWASP SOC 09 BUDGET

  - The initial Budget for SoC 09 will be US$90,000, and it is funded by
    OWASP.
  - In parallel with the Request for Proposals, OWASP is also launching
    a [sponsorship drive](OWASP_Season_of_Code_Sponsorship "wikilink")
    in which sponsors will have the option to choose which project
    releases they would like to support.
  - The funds available will be allocated to select project releases.
    However, strong proposals will be accepted by majority vote of the
    OWASP Board before the final application selection. Remaining budget
    will be allocated to remaining applications.
  - Note: The referred budget allocation is just a guideline and the
    final values will be adjusted based on the successful proposals.

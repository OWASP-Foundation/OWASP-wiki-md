  - *' Understanding how to prevent Sensitive Data Exposure - Simon
    Greatrix \[ [PDF](Media:Owaspsuffollk-20190319.pdf "wikilink") \] \[
    [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1nNq3wt7Bg) \]*'

<!-- end list -->

  -
    Sensitive data is often the target of any attack, and its exposure
    has the greatest risk of long-term damage. OWASP and the PCI DSS
    provide many recommendations. The internet provides even more. These
    can be hard to understand, hard to implement, and contradictory. I
    will be sharing my understanding of how the cryptographic algorithms
    work and how they should best be used.

#### Speakers

  - Dr Simon Greatrix has been writing software since the late 70s and
    has worked as a security expert for e-commerce for nearly 20 years.
    He is currently working on SETL’s block chain product. Java has been
    his preferred programming language since 1996.

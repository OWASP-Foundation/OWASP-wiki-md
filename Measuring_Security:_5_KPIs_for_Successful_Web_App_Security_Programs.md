"Raf_Official_HP_Headshot_Avatar.jpg")Modern enterprises recognize the
need to test their web applications for security vulnerabilities, but
few security organizations can quantify the success or failure of their
programs to the business. Thatâ€™s because traditional security lifecycle
metrics fail to convey whether the organization is actually reducing
risks. Attendees will learn how to develop organizational metrics that
leverage proven QA data, in addition to security data, to form a
complete picture. The session will cover five critical KPIs which
demonstrate security risks associated with web applications as a
function of overall software quality.

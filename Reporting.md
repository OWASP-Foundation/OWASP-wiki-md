Performing the technical side of the assessment is only half of the
overall assessment process. The final product is the production of a
well written and informative report. A report should be easy to
understand and should highlight all the risks found during the
assessment phase. The report should appeal to both executive management
and technical staff.

The report needs to have three major sections. It should be created in a
manner that allows each separate section to be printed and given to the
appropriate teams, such as the developers or system managers. The
recommended sections are outlined below.

**1. Executive Summary**

The executive summary sums up the overall findings of the assessment and
gives business managers and system owners a high level view of the
vulnerabilities discovered. The language used should be more suited to
people who are not technically aware and should include graphs or other
charts which show the risk level. Keep in mind that executives will
likely only have time to read this summary and will want two questions
answered in plain language: 1) *What's wrong?* 2) *How do I fix it?* You
have one page to answer these questions.

The executive summary should plainly state that the vulnerabilities and
their severity is an **input** to their organizational risk management
process, not an outcome or remediation. It is safest to explain that
tester does not understand the threats faced by the organization or
business consequences if the vulnerabilities are exploited. This is the
job of the risk professional who calculates risk levels based on this
and other information. Risk management will typically be part of the
organization's IT Security Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) regime
and this report will simply provide an input to that process.

**2. Test Parameters**

The Introduction should outline the parameters of the security testing,
the findings and remediation. Some suggested section headings include:

2.1 Project Objective: This section outlines the project objectives and
the expected outcome of the assessment.

2.2 Project Scope: This section outlines the agreed scope.

2.3 Project Schedule: This section outlines when the testing commenced
and when it was completed.

2.4 Targets: This section lists the number of applications or targeted
systems.

2.5 Limitations: This section outlines every limitation which was faced
throughout the assessment. For example, limitations of project-focused
tests, limitation in the security testing methods, performance or
technical issues that the tester come across during the course of
assessment, etc.

2.6 Findings Summary: This section outlines the vulnerabilities that
were discovered during testing.

2.7 Remediation Summary: This section outlines the action plan for
fixing the vulnerabilities that were discovered during testing.

**3. Findings**

The last section of the report includes detailed technical information
about the vulnerabilities found and the actions needed to resolve them.
This section is aimed at a technical level and should include all the
necessary information for the technical teams to understand the issue
and resolve it. Each finding should be clear and concise and give the
reader of the report a full understanding of the issue at hand.

The findings section should include:

  - Screenshots and command lines to indicate what tasks were undertaken
    during the execution of the test case
  - The affected item
  - A technical description of the issue and the affected function or
    object
  - A section on resolving the issue
  - The severity rating \[1\], with vector notation if using CVSS

The following is the list of controls that were tested during the
assessment:

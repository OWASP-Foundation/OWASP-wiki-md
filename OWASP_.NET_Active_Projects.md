### OWASP Projects

**Note:** While these projects are labeled as Active, a more accurate
label might be Available. Few of them are actively developed either
because the project has run its cource, or the tool does its job and no
further development is needed.

**Note:** The following releases are available on the [dotNET
section](https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=64424&package_id=105632)

## The presentation

![Tom_Brennan.jpg](Tom_Brennan.jpg "Tom_Brennan.jpg")There is a
difference between what is possible and what is probable, something we
often lose sight of in the world of information security. For example, a
vulnerability represents a possible way for an attacker to exploit an
asset, but remember not all vulnerabilities are created equal. Obviously
we must also keep in mind that just because a vulnerability exists does
not necessarily mean it will be exploited, or indicate by whom or to
what extent. Clearly, many vulnerabilities are very serious leaving the
door open to compromise of sensitive information, financial loss, brand
damage, violation of industry regulations, and downtime. Some
vulnerabilities are more difficult to exploit than others and therefore
attract different attackers. Autonomous worms & viruses may attack one
type of issue, while a sentient targeted attacker may prefer another
path. Better understanding of these factors enables us to make informed
business decisions about website risk management and what is probable.

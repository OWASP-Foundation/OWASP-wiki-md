Oracle Application Express (Oracle APEX), formerly called HTML DB, is a
rapid web application development tool for the Oracle database. Using
only a web browser and limited programming experience, you can develop
and deploy professional applications that are both fast and secure.
Oracle application express combines the qualities of a personal
database, productivity, ease of use, and flexibility with the qualities
of an enterprise database, security, integrity, scalability,
availability and built for the web. Application Express is a tool to
build web-based applications and the application development environment
is also conveniently web-based.

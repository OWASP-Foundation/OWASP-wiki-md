## The presentation

![Owasp_logo_normal.jpg](Owasp_logo_normal.jpg
"Owasp_logo_normal.jpg")In April 2010, the Defense Information Systems
Agency (DISA) released Version 3 of its Application Security and
Development (ASD) Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG). The
ASD STIG is a series of application security requirements that apply to
"all DoD developed, architected, and administered applications and
systems connected to DoD networks." This presentation talks about the
various that can be used to help fulfill these requirements. This
presentation is given as part of [OWASP Software Assurance
Day](OWASP_Software_Assurance_Day_DC_2010 "wikilink") at the [| 13th
Annual Software Assurance
Forum](https://buildsecurityin.us-cert.gov/bsi/events/1133-BSI.html).

## Notes

Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) provides Security
Implementation Technical Guides (STIGs) to cover the gamut of systems
dev elopement. The [Application Security and Development (ASD)
STIG](http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/downloads/zip/unclassified_application_security_development_stig_v3r1.zip)
first issued in 2006 and the most recent issuance came out in April
2010. This STIG applies to all DOD developed, architected, and
administered applications. There are a 157 different STIG rules, some
are very broad, others very specific, and some are complex. It is easy
to get lost in the weeds. Some are harder to test than others. There are
procedural, configuration, and standards requirements. OWASP is
explicitly called out as a resource in the ASD STIG checklist; see the
OWASP documentation projects and they are free. The [OWASP Top Ten
Project](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project)
lines up well with the ASP STIG; there are 33 Category One STIG flaws
most of which in the top 10.

Li reviewed the STIG requirements and related OWASP tools and methods.
There is no “[gold disk](http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/faq.html#15)” for
the ASD STIG. However, the [OWASP Live CD Education
Project](:Category:OWASP_LiveCD_Education_Project "wikilink") could be
used if some one were to contribute a mapping of the tools with the
STIG. Some of the requirements Jason reviewed include: [OWASP
DirBuster](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_DirBuster_Project)
can in part address APP3620 Information Disclosure. APP5080 Code Review
is covered by the [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard
(ASVS)](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Application_Security_Verification_Standard_Project).
APP6130 Systems Monitoring would be met by the [OWASP AppSensor
Project](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_AppSensor_Project).
APP5100 Fuzz Testing can be met by the [OWASP JBroFuzz
Project](OWASP_JBroFuzz "wikilink") and the [OWASP WSFuzzer
Project](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_WSFuzzer_Project).

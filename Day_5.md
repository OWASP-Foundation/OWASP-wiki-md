<span id="Compensating Controls"></span>

## Compensating Controls

  - Implement compensating controls to limit the likelihood of
    successful attacks; for example, deploy web application firewalls
    (WAFs) that inspect all traffic flowing to the web application for

<span id="Mitigating Controls"></span>

## Mitigating Controls

  - Implement mitigating controls to discover and prevent mistakes that
    may lead to the introduction of vulnerabilities; for example,
    Control 6 of the CSIS 20 Critical Security Controls â€“ Application
    Software Security. Build security into the development life cycle.

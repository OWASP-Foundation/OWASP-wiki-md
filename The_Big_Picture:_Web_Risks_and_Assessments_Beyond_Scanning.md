## The presentation

"Owasp_logo_normal.jpg")This talk is an unabashed look at the role and
limitations of automated technologies in a complete web risk assessment
by an industry pioneer and veteran. Whereas once a good web scanner
could be thought of at the sum total of a strong web application
security program, now it's only the beginning. We will look at a broader
picture of web risks and their associated threats, and what assessment
techniques and technologies can be applied to them.

## The speaker

Matthew Fisher was the first Security Engineer hired by an industry
leading application security company that was acquired by
Hewlett-Packard in 2007.  Shortly thereafter he left HP to form Piscis;
an emergent boutique of veterans focused squarely on the art and science
of application security.  As a pioneer and industry leader, Matt has
several original vulnerabilities, exploit and testing techniques to his
name, and is an accomplished writer and speaker, having presented at
ShmooCon, ToorCon, Gartner, CSI, ReBl, DoD Cybercrime, and many others.

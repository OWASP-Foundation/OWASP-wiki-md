# About the Talk

User generated rich content is increasingly necessary for websites to
stay relevant in today's Internet. The problem with rich content is that
it can contain malicious attacks - most commonly cross-site scripting
attacks. Websites were faced with a dilemma: incorporate user generated
rich content and potentially expose their users to malicious content
(along with the negative publicity that comes with it) or see users
migrate to other more featured sites. The [OWASP Anti-Samy
Project](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_AntiSamy_Project)
was created by Arshan Dabirsiaghi as a tool to solve this dilemma by
allowing websites to validate free form, rich user content in a positive
manner. This talk will demonstrate how Anti-Samy can be used to enable
websites to include rich user content that includes HTML and CSS while
still protecting users from malicious content with a high degree of
assurance. The talk will also update the community on improvements in
the latest release and discuss the future roadmap for the project.

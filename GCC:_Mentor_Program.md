## Goal

The mentors program will provide leadership and guidance to new or
reestablished chapter and chapter leaders. New chapter leaders are
provided little direction on how to manage/run their chapter.

The mentor program will help:

  - Ensure more active OWASP chapters.
  - Ensure consistency in chapter structure and policies.
  - Facilitate more inter-chapter communication.

## How?

A starting chapter leader will be assigned a mentor who will help the
new leader using e-mail but also telephone and potentially face to face
meetings. The mentoring process will be allocated one year after which
the new chapter will become independent.

The mentor will provide the necessary tutoring and ease the uncertainty
involved in starting a new chapter. To facilitate phone and face to face
meetings that are important especially to ease the uncertainly of a new
leader, mentors will be selected from a geographically close location to
the new chapter.

Mentors are successful chapter leaders selected and invited by the
Global Chapter Committee. The criteria for selection is based on the
mentor's chapter success, growth, structure, and stability.

Several tools are under development or planned by the Global Chapter
Committee to help mentors:

  - A mentor checklist
  - The chapter handbook itself
  - A PowerPoint version of the handbook
  - A chapters leadership podcast and video presentation
  - A certification program for OWASP leaders as a pre-requisite for
    mentoring.

OWASP will provide financial aid or facilities such a phone bridge or
travel cost.

## Description

Any company as a whole is made up of individuals. If the company
experiences a revenue reduction, this translates down to a reduction in
benefits for the employees and possibly even to a reduction of the
number of its employees.

## Risk Factors

  - The financial report is impacted when an application or network
    service level agreement is not met

<!-- end list -->

  - Reduction in benefits for the individual

<!-- end list -->

  - Reduction in headcount for the company

<!-- end list -->

  - A company's expenses will exceed its revenues

<!-- end list -->

  - Hackers invading a network or application system

<!-- end list -->

  - PCI compliancy did not occur and the company is fined

## Examples

### A Company's Expenses Exceed Its Revenues

The business looks at ways to reduce costs. Employee benefits are
re-examined and modified to support reducing company cost thus reducing
its yearly expenses.

### Domino Impact

A hacker invades a network and finds its way through an application
wall. The customerâ€™s encrypted personal data was opened and used outside
in the business market. The customer files a lawsuit against the
company. The company files bankruptcy.

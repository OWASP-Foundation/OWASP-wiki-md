With the theme 'Setting the AppSec agenda for 2009', the OWASP Summit
will be a worldwide gathering of OWASP leaders and key industry players
to present and discuss the latest OWASP tools, documentation projects,
and web application security trends. Join us in Portugal in just a few
short weeks\! This venue hosts a diverse selection of training courses
along with technical and business tracks, making it THE place to learn
about web application security and the resources OWASP has available for

OWASP is a not-for-profit organization with the purpose of supporting
the Web Application Security community around the world, and has granted
$250,000 USD for web application security research. In addition to over
40 presentations from the OWASP Leaders and grant recipients, the OWASP
Summit will host multiple Working Sessions designed to improve
collaboration, achieve specific objectives and identify roadmaps for
OWASP projects, chapters, and the OWASP community itself.

To facilitate this event, OWASP is investing $150,000 USD which will be
used to cover air travel and accommodation expenses for OWASP leaders,
active contributors, and select key industry leaders. With their
confirmed presence (see list here:

meet, discuss, influence and contribute to OWASP projects.

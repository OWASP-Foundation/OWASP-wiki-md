## Agenda:

''' 17:00
''' **Gathering, food, and drinks (KOSHER)**

''' 17:30
''' ''' Introductions and Opening Notes '''

''' 17:45 – Encrypting Data at Scale *'
*' Gleb Keselman, Intuit Data Protection Services '''
Intuit's internal key management service served, just over a month ago,
to encrypt the tax and financial history of more than 30 million
American citizens. Overall, this required 2 billion cryptographic
operations to encrypt and decrypt application data.

Scaling a key management service requires a combination of system-level
best practices along with novel cryptographic solutions. We will discuss
how we are able to achieve a high level of security, combined with ease
of use for developers and great performance. 

''' 18:30 – "... well then, we have an OWASP Top 10 opportunity" *'
*' Josh Grossman, Comsec Group '''
A couple of months ago the draft 2017 version of the OWASP Top 10 list
was released and with it came some surprises and some controversy.

Whilst the Top 10 is very widely used, many people do not realise how it
is actually produced and what it is based on. When I dug into the
process behind it, the picture became even more concerning.

In this session, I will explain the basis of the latest Top 10 list,
summarise the reaction to the recent release and give my take on what I
think should be done next. I will also suggest how we can use the Top 10
list and other OWASP projects to give better application security advice
and also how we can contribute back.

''' 19:15 - Coffee Break '''

''' 19:30 – Cloud Security for Startups - From A to E(xit) *'
*' Shahar Maor, Outbrain *'
*' Eitan Satmary, Wix '''
Founding a startup is a hard work. The daily roller coaster can exhaust
you fast. And on top of that, you need to cope with information security
challenges, compliance and tough questions from customers.

The Israeli chapter of the Cloud Security Alliance is helping the local
startup community cope with those challenges. Over the last couple of
years we have identified a gap in the InfoSec knowledge and produced a
Best Practices manual, designed for startups that rely on Cloud
infrastructure. This talk is a digest of a paper created by the Israeli
Chapter of the CSA to help Software-as-a-Service startups (SaaS-SUs)
gain and maintain client trust, by building solid security foundations.

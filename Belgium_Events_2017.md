    (by Sebastien Deleersnyder, OWASP)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *Abstract:* The [OWASP Summit 2017](https://owaspsummit.org/) is a
    5-day participant driven event, dedicated to the collaboration of
    Development and Security professionals, with a strong focus on
    DevSecOps. This session will be a debriefing of what was delivered
    by 130+ participants in 145 Working Sessions :-).
    *Bio:* Sebastien is an OWASP volunteer, Summit co-organizer and
    application security consultant at Toreon."

  - 19h45 - 20h30: **'[Threat modeling lessons from Star Wars (BruCON
    Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2zvfevLnp4)** (by Adam
    Shostack, freelance security consultant)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *Abstract:* Everyone knows you ought to threat model, but in
    practical reality it turns out to be tricky. If past efforts to
    threat model haven't panned out, perhaps part of the problem is
    confusion over what works, and how the various approaches conflict
    or align. This talk captures lessons from years of work helping
    people throughout the software industry threat model more
    effectively. It's designed to help security pros, developers and
    systems managers, all of whom will leave with both threat modeling
    lessons from Star Wars and a proven foundation, enabling them to
    threat model effectively.
    *Bio:* Adam is a consultant, entrepreneur, technologist, author and
    game designer. He's a member of the BlackHat Review Board, and
    helped found the CVE and many other things. He's currently helping a
    variety of organizations improve their security, and advising and
    mentoring startups as a Mach37 Star Mentor. While at Microsoft, he
    drove the Autorun fix into Windows Update, was the lead designer of
    the SDL Threat Modeling Tool v3 and created the "Elevation of
    Privilege" game. Adam is the author of "Threat Modeling: Designing
    for Security," and the co-author of "The New School of Information
    Security."

### PROGRAM

The agenda:

  - 18h00 - 18h50: **Welcome & sandwiches**
  - 18h50 - 19h00: **[OWASP
    Update](https://www.owasp.org/images/6/6c/Owasp_Belgium_update_2017-05-29.pdf)**
    (by Lieven Desmet)
  - 19h00 - 19h45: **[HTTP for the Good or the
    Bad](media:2017-05-29_OWASP-BE_HTTPForTheGoodOrTheBad.pdf "wikilink")**
    (by Xavier Mertens, freelance security consultant)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *Abstract:* Today, the classic infection vectors remain SMTP and
    HTTP. Many spam & phishing campaigns are delivered to the victim’s
    mailbox and usually the next step of the attack is performed on top
    of HTTP, by visiting a malicious website or downloading a piece of
    malicious code. This talk will be split in two parts. To begin, I’ll
    explain how HTTP techniques are used to make the life of security
    researchers and incident handlers more difficult (attackers use many
    techniques to prevent access to their juicy data). The next part
    will demonstrate that attackers are also humans and make mistakes
    like all of us. They also need to follow the OWASP Top-10\! I’ll
    review some example of bad code / bad configuration that I found
    during my investigations.
    *Bio:* **Xavier Mertens** is a freelance security consultant based
    in Belgium. His job focuses on protecting his customers by applying
    “offensive” (pentesting) as well as “defensive” security (incident
    handling, log management, SIEM, security visualisation, OSINT).
    Xavier is also a SANS Internet Storm Center handler
    (https://isc.sans.org). He’s also maintaining his security blog
    (https://blog.rootshell.be) and is a co-organizer of the BruCON
    security conference (http://www.brucon.org).

  - 19h45 - 20h30: **Reverse engineering with Panopticon: a Libre
    Cross-Platform Disassembler** (by Kai Michaelis)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *Abstract:* The Panopticon project aims to develop a tool to end the
    dominance of proprietary software for reverse engineering.
    Panopticon is a graphical disassembler written in Rust that runs on
    GNU/Linux, Windows and OS X, which aims to create a free replacement
    for tools like IDA Pro and BinDiff.
    What sets Panopticon apart from other free disassembler is the
    belief that an intuitive GUI is paramount to aid human analysts to
    understand as much of the binary as possible. As such Panopticon
    comes with an Qt 5 UI written in QML that allows browsing and
    annotating control flow graphs.
    *Bio:* **Kai Michaelis** studies IT-Security in Bochum, Germany and
    works part-time on Free Software. When he's not on the campus you
    can meet him at the local hackerspace. His interests are program
    analysis, reverse engineering and cryptography.

  - 20h10 - 21h00: **[Why traditional Web security technologies no
    longer
    suffice](https://www.owasp.org/images/d/db/DeRyck_OWASP_WebSecurityOverview_2017-02-28.pdf)**
    (by Philippe De Ryck, KU Leuven)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *Abstract:* Not a day goes by without a story on a Web security
    incident somewhere. A data breach disclosing millions of people’s
    details. A defacement of a major Web site. Malware served from a
    legitimate Web site to thousands of users. Contrary to popular
    belief, the people running these Web sites are generally not
    clueless about security, but getting it right is just not that easy.
    Recent evolutions, like the rise of public networks, or the strong
    dependence on third-party code, have made it easier to attack Web
    sites, and harder to defend them. Join us to get an overview of
    these threats, and to take a dive into HTTP Strict Transport
    Security (HSTS), one of the latest Web security technologies that
    really help you improve security.
    *Bio:* **Philippe De Ryck** is a professional speaker and trainer on
    software security and web security. Since he obtained his PhD at the
    imec-DistriNet research group (KU Leuven, Belgium), he has been
    running the group's Web Security Training program, which ensures a
    sustainable knowledge transfer of the group’s security expertise
    towards practitioners.

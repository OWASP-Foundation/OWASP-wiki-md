Online IIS Metabase Explorer is a tool that allows the online browsing
of the current IIS Metabase.

This tool clearly shows the current IIS Metabase ACL vulnerability which
allows the disclose of the IIS Anonymous users' details (i.e. the
username and password) by accounts that belong to the IIS_WPG security
group

## Participants

  - <b>Richard Bejtlich</b> is the director of incident response at GE.
    He is also the author of <http://taosecurity.blogspot.com>

## Questions

1.  Would you care to tell us how did you get into IT and what lead you
    into a career in information security? What keeps you busy these
    days?
2.  What's the difference between focusing on threats vs focusing on
    vulnerabilities?
3.  What is your problem with the "protect the data" mindset?
4.  What do you mean by "building visibility in"?
5.  What is your take on the Aurora/Google hack?
6.  You just tweeted that "Network Security Monitoring ideology is the
    proper mechanism to combat APT/APA". Do you think network
    IPS/IDS/WAF can help defend insecure web applications? What are the
    limits of Network Security Monitoring?
7.  How important a role do you think secure coding and secure software
    development life-cycle play in defending the enterprise?
8.  Have HIPAA, PCI, SOX and other regulations helped reduce risk in the
    average enterprise?
9.  Is seems pretty clear that attackers have a clear advantage. Why is
    that? How can we turn the tide?
10. Any thoughts on OWASP? Are we helping the cause?
11. Where are we going to be as an industry in 10 years?
12. You blogged that "The trustworthiness of a digital asset is limited
    by the owner's capability to detect incidents compromising the
    integrity of that asset." Given that we don't have any high
    integrity database, identities or application servers - how do you
    detect a breach of integrity when there is no verifiable integrity
    in the system in the first place?

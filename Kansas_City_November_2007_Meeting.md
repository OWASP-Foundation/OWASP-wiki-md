### Meeting Summary

**Chapter Business**

Current chapter priorities include the following:

  - Volunteer to give an OWASP presentation
      - Talks can anything from a short review of a whitepaper or
        presentation you've seen, to a web application security tool or
        product review, to a longer technical talk about attacks or
        countermeasures
  - Volunteer your organization to host an OWASP meeting
  - Invite other professionals or students to attend our next OWASP
    meeting

**Speaker 1: Tom Stripling, CISSP on The Dangers of Third-Party
Content**

It is now commonplace for web applications to include content from other
sites, partners, and advertisers. If this content isnâ€™t handled
correctly, applications are left vulnerable to attack. By examining a
variety of attacks that can be executed through third-party content, we
can better evaluate application risk and design countermeasures.

Session Learning Objectives

  - Determine the threat posed by third-party content, given trends in
    Internet content and specific risks associated with each form of
    third-party content inclusion
  - Demonstrate attacks against a live web application that exploit
    flawed security assumptions in the inclusion of third-party content
  - Analyze the effectiveness of various application security
    countermeasures to combat the threat
  - Enable developers and penetration testers to better identify and
    prevent the risks associated with the use of third-party content in
    web applications

Tom Stripling is a senior application security consultant with an
extensive background in web application development, penetration
testing, and risk assessment. In his role at Security PS, he helps
clients uncover application vulnerabilities and secure the software
development process. In his spare time, Tom is an avid researcher of
application security attacks, vulnerabilities, and best practices.

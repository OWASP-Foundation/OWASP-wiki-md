## Description

Sniffing application traffic simply means that the attacker is able to
view network traffic and will try to steal credentials, confidential
information, or other sensitive data.

Anyone with physical access to the network, whether it is switched or
via a hub, is likely able to sniff the traffic. (See dsniff and arpspoof
tools). Also, anyone with access to intermediate routers, firewalls,
proxies, servers, or other networking gear may be able to see the
traffic as well.

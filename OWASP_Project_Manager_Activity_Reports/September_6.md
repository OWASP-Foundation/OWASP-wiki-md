##### Other Issues

  - Supported Mark Curphey's efforts to engage OWASP community in the
    activity of producing videos to document the community's wide
    vitality and diversity;
  - Studied the [OWASP Projects
    Handbook](https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/document/d/1ilLGVEM4zWiPgMPDRHe8ARdeLSnoBTUtMq0C-Ta45tc/edit?authkey=CLTW_MUO&hl=en_US)
    so to prepare my participation in the forthcoming GPC's working
    Session at OWASP AppSecUsa;
  - Had a week out of work - vacation time.

##### Routine Tasks

  - My daily routine always includes answering a relatively wide range
    of questions regularly posed by OWASP members and mainly by OWASP
    Projects leaders; I receive such inquiries either directly or
    through the [OWASP Website Global Feedback & Inquiry
    Form](https://spreadsheets0.google.com/a/owasp.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AhtB029bdcxGdFN1R2NIMTNROXN3dml4ZEcxXzJQYXc#gid=0).
    The variety of matters that I currently deal with can be checked in
    my email tool and the tree of folders built to store, follow up and
    organize them as follows

    I would like to note that to perform this task, and all the others
    projects' related ones, I have always had relevant support and
    guidance from the OWASP Global Projects Committee.
  - I've kept all [OWASP Projects Dashboard
    2.0](OWASP_Projects_Dashboard_2.0 "wikilink")'s databases up-to-date
    as follows:
      - [OWASP Reviews Dashboard](OWASP_Reviews_Dashboard "wikilink"),
      - [OWASP Project Reviewers
        Database](OWASP_Project_Reviewers_Database "wikilink"),
      - [Projects 2.0/By Set Up Date
        Order](OWASP_Projects_Dashboard_2.0/By_Set_Up_Order "wikilink"),
      - [Projects 2.0/By Alphabetic
        Order](OWASP_Projects_Dashboard_2.0/By_Alphabetical_Order "wikilink"),
      - [OWASP Training](OWASP_Training "wikilink"),
      - [OWASP Project
        Inventory](https://spreadsheets0.google.com/a/owasp.org/spreadsheet/ccc?pli=1&key=tF9r45eprbpdY6xuSbwEuMw#gid=0).

#### Proposal of future activity

  - To continue answering all received projects' related questions.
  - To continue setting up new projects and new releases as requested.
  - To implement all GPC requests and concretely to support its plans
    to:
      - Carry out the Project Hosting initiative as a tool to provide a
        centralized repository for OWASP;
      - Build a new OWASP Projects Portal;
  - To set up all the [OWASP free training
    courses](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Training#tab=Initiatives)
    that may be requested by OWASP Chapters.
  - To work with Dinis Cruz, Carlos Serr√£o and Konstantinos
    Papapanagiotou to produce an initial/draft proposal of an OWASP
    Training Academy.

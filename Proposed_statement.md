OWASP should focus its efforts on becoming and staying THE body of
knowledge covering web application security. OWASP will however not
start its own certifications or promote other certifications. If other
organisations wish to start certifications based on OWASP material, we
welcome this: as long as this honours the current open license model of
OWASP and does not abuse the OWASP brand for commercial reasons.

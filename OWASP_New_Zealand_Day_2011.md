#### Speakers

## Blair Strang - Security-Assessment.com - Secure Development: What The OWASP Guide Didn't Tell You

OWASP has lots of useful information for developers wishing to secure
their applications. However, there are concepts which can make your life
easier which are not covered in the OWASP guide.

\+ Where in your code to apply the OWASP recommended protections
\+ Some advice on hard-to-get right protections
\+ Bonus protections: Advanced security measures not in the OWASP
guide
<b>Blair Strang</b>

Bio to come

## Andrew Evans - Kiwibank - I \<3 Reporting - Managing Effective Web Application Assessments

In a previous role as a full time penetration test manager, I often
encountered situations where the outcome of a penetration test was
affected by the preparedness of the client, the information and
resources available to the testers, and the ability of the client to
interpret the report. While there are abundant resources for penetration
testers available to teach techniques for web application hacking, there
is very little information to guide pre and post engagement activities
such as scoping, logistics, and reporting.

The complexity of modern web applications means that there is a huge
dependency on clients understanding what is required of them, and how to
provide the appropriate information and resources to testers to get the
best outcome from a penetration test.

<b>Andrew Evans</b>

Andrew Evans is an information security jack-of-all-trades at Kiwibank.
Prior to that, he managed penetration tests for a large UK bank, where
he spent his time being schmoozed by vendors, LOLing at reports,
shouting at developers, and playing havoc with go-live dates.

## Nick von Dadelszen – Lateral Security - Testing Mobile Applications

Mobile applications are the "next big thing" in application development
and it seems everyone is developing them, including banks, travel
companies, retail outlets and everyone else. Mobile application security
requires a different focus to standard web applications and this talk
discusses those differences, how to test mobile applications, and some
tips and tricks from Lateral Security's experience in penetration
testing mobile applications.

<b>Nick von Dadelszen</b>

Nick von Dadelszen is a respected security consultant with over 10 years
experience in the security industry. In that time he has worked with the
majority of New Zealand's largest organisations including leading
players in a government, financial, and telecommunications sectors.

Nick has previously managed two successful security teams and is now a
co-founder of Lateral Security, responsible for technical delivery of
projects.

## Adrian Hayes - Security-Assessment.com - Web Crypto for the Developer Who Has Better Things To Do

Crypto is easy to get wrong and can be a pain to implement. This
presentation will take you through practical examples of how to
implement solid crypto on a number of common development platforms.
We'll talk about how to store and verify passwords, how to safely
transport and store backups. What's wrong with some default SSL
configurations and maybe even random token generation among other
things. Web app crypto should be easy and secure, not just one of those.

<b>Adrian Hayes</b>

Adrian Hayes is a security consultant for Security-Assessment.com in
Wellington. Adrian comes from a web app development background but has
jumped the fence and now spends his time hacking them.

## Brett Moore - Insomnia Security - Concurrency Vulnerabilities

Concurrency vulnerabilities are not very common, as they require
specific circumstances for a vulnerable scenario to exist. However, the
consequences of such issues can be devastating and include auth bypass,
cross user account access, and purchase tampering.

This talk will discuss in detail some of the situations leading to these
vulnerabilities, and how they can be detected both at the source level
and during active testing.

<b>Brett Moore</b>

Having conducted vulnerability assessments, network reviews, and
penetration tests for the majority of the large companies in New
Zealand, Insomnia founder Brett Moore brings with him over eight years
experience in information security. During this time, Brett has also
worked with companies such as SUN Microsystems, Skype Limited and
Microsoft Corporation by reporting and helping to fix security
vulnerabilities in their products. Brett has released numerous
whitepapers and technical postings related to security issues and has
spoken at security conferences both locally and overseas, including
BlackHat, Defcon, Syscan, Kiwicon, Ruxcon, and the invitation only
Microsoft internal security conference called BlueHat.

## Sam Pickles - F5 - A Day in the Life of a WAF

Web Application Firewalls in production get to see a large volume of
malicious requests; and present a unique opportunity to discover what is
really happening out in the black hat community.

In this talk, real attack examples seen in production will be presented
which demonstrate the reality and relevance of the OWASP Top Ten. Attack
samples and reports have been gathered from a number of sites globally
and sanitised, and will be used to help understand the answers to some
common questions:

\- How often is my application being attacked? (more than you might
think)
\- What techniques are being attempted?
\- Who is doing this, and why?
Additionally, some recent headline-grabbing hacks in banking and finance
will be detailed at a practical level.

<b>Sam Pickles</b>

Sam Pickles has worked across the security industry for over ten years,
in APAC, EMEA, and USA. Sam has held senior technical responsibility
within many high profile IT and physical security projects across
banking, government and service provider customers. During this period
he has been involved in creating some of the world's largest web
application firewall gateways, designed and built IT security systems
and conducted network, application and hardware device penetration
testing.

As an architect and security specialist with F5 Networks, Sam maintains
a keen interest in web application security, is a member of OWASP and a
long time attendee of chapter meetings in London. He has degrees in
Physics from the University of Otago, and Computer Science from the
University of Oxford.

## Kirk Jackson / Mike Haworth - Aura Information Security - HTML5 Security

HTML5 brings a suite of new features to browsers these features are
enabled and the browser we use today. Some features that'll be more
interesting to application security reviewers are:

\- The loosening of the same origin policy
\- WebSockets
\- Local Storage
\- And a bunch of new XSS vectors
<b>Kirk Jackson</b>

Kirk Jackson is a Security Consultant for Aura Information Security, and
has spent a decent percentage of his waking life building websites for a
living (most recently at Xero).

<b>Mike Haworth</b>

Mike Haworth, tests pens for AuraInfoSec. Former webmonkey and
recovering Drupaholic

## Kirk Jackson - Aura Information Security - File Uploads are Evil

So your users want to upload and share files on your website? We know
how to put XSS protections in place, but how do we protect against
malicious content uploaded to our sites?

<b>Kirk Jackson</b>

Kirk Jackson is a Security Consultant for Aura Information Security, and
has spent a decent percentage of his waking life building websites for a
living (most recently at Xero).

## Mark Young - Datacom - Sleeping Easy: Architecting Web Applications Securely

Tales from a developer – practical tips on how to lead teams and design
solutions in a way that produces secure web applications. Starting off
with “why does security matter to my customers”, I’ll look at how to get
organisations and teams on board and excited about security. Then mostly
using .NET will show some common mistakes I’ve observed and specific
examples of how solution and application framework design can mitigate
some of these issues. I’ll look at difficulties in integrating a secure
development lifecycle into the daily grind of project delivery and some
of the struggles and pitfalls with implementing secure practices. If
there’s time I’ll squeeze in some exemplar exploits as well.

<b>Mark Young</b>

Mark Young is a senior developer / team lead / architect at Datacom in
Auckland, who has spent the last few years leading dev teams and
architecting enterprise web systems, particularly in banking. Mark has a
focus on web security, has been known to deliver and reproduce exploits,
and has also been stung a few times by his code (or that of his team).

## Quintin Russ - SiteHost - Real Applications, Real Vulnerabilities, Really Exploited

Websites are being compromised. Daily. Some of these attacks are
sophisticated and occur without warning, but many are not. This talk
will look at some widely exploited vulnerabilities in popular
applications, such as authentication bypass, remote code execution & SQL
injection. We will cover how they were exploited and discuss techniques
to help organisations avoid becoming another statistic.

<b>Quintin Russ</b>

Quintin has carved out his own niche in the .nz hosting industry, having
spent a large proportion of the last few years becoming an expert in
both building and defending systems. He now runs enough infrastructure
to ensure he never, ever gets a good night's sleep, and sometimes
doesn't even get to snooze through Sunday mornings. Quintin has a keen
interest in security, especially as it relates to web hosting. This has
ranged from the vicissitudes of shared hosting to code reviews of
popular blogging applications. He has previously presented at ISIG,
OWASP & Kiwicon.

The OWASP Top 10 covers many of the risks facing web applications every day. This training will explain each of the 10 risks, demonstrating the vulnerabilities and provide platform-agnostic recommendations for remediating these issues through the use of existing OWASP projects. The thorough explanation of vulnerabilities, exploits and remediations will leave you with a clear understanding of the OWASP Top 10 risks and how to avoid them.</p>
<p>This training course is a compact version of Security-Assessment.com's brand new two-day intensive secure web application development tutorial. We encourage the use of the Top 10 to get organisations started with application security so developers can learn from the mistakes of other organisations. Executives can start thinking about how to manage the risk that software applications create in their enterprise.</p></td>

#### Call For Sponsorships (CLOSED)

**The call for silver and gold sponsorships is now closed, however we
are still looking for support sponsors who can provide media
coverage/promotion for the event.**

Following the success of the previous events in 2009 and 2010, OWASP New
Zealand Day 2011 will be held in Auckland on the 7th of July, 2011.
OWASP New Zealand Day is a security conference entirely dedicated to web
application security. The conference is once again being hosted by the
University of Auckland School of Business with their support and
assistance. OWASP New Zealand Day 2011 is a free event, but requires
sponsor support to help be an instructive and quality event for the New
Zealand community. OWASP is strictly non for profit. The sponsorship
money will be used to help make OWASP New Zealand Day 2011 a free,
compelling and valuable experience for the audience.

The sponsorship funds collected are to be used for things such as:

  - Refreshments (coffee break/lunch) - we want to keep people refreshed
    during the day; while we certainly bring good and interesting
    speakers, we don't want people to go home when they become hungry.
  - Name tags - we feel that getting to know people within the New
    Zealand community is important, and name tags make that possible.
  - Promotion - up to now our events are propagating by word of mouth.
    We would like to get to a wider audience by advertising our events.
  - Printed Materials - printed materials will include brochures, tags
    and lanyards.

## Facts

Last year, the event was supported by 3 sponsors and attracted more than
150 participants. A lot of good feedback from the audience was received
and this is the reason why we are re-organising the event. For more
information on last year's event, please visit:
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2010>

The OWASP New Zealand community is strong and there are more than 160
people currently subscribed to the mailing-list. OWASP New Zealand Day
is expected to attract a number between 150 and 200 attendees during the
conference.

OWASP regular attendees are IT project managers, IT security managers,
IT security consultants, web application architects and developers, QA
managers, QA testers and system administrators.

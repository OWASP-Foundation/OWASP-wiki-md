From Jim: I brought the HTTP Response splitting page back. I am fully
deleting the CLASP and other old projects from the wiki - so I removed
those categories form the page when I brought it back.

If you see anything else that I deleted (and I deleted a lot) that needs
to be brought back, let me know via jim@owasp.org.

## Comments left on "Choosing and Using Security Questions Cheat Sheet"

Douglas,

Regarding your comment. For the most part, but unfortunately I don't see
this changing anytime soon. It is likely to be around as long as
passwords are still used, some people will forget their passwords. And
since by some accounts a call to the help desk costs as much as $5.00
USD, mechanisms involving automatic resets of forgotten passwords will
be preferred. (And besides, for companies not having questions that they
can ask about a user's transactional history, etc., how are they to
confirm the identity of a user claiming a forgotten password?) So as
long as that's the case, this a wiki cheat sheet as well as the related
"Forgot Password" cheat sheet will hopefully make this method of
resetting passwords as secure as possible. What we really need to do is
to replace passwords with stronger authentication mechanisms such as
FIDO, etc. but that is something that likely will take many years to
become mainstream.

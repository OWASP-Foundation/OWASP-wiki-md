## Review plan

The plan is:

  - 3/9: Project kickoff
  - 3/9-3/16: Perform Stage 1 review
  - 3/16: Status meeting
  - 3/16 - 3/23: Perform Stage 2 review
  - 3/23: Status meeting
  - 3/23 - 3/25: Stage 3 activities
  - 3/25: Compile comments
  - 3/26: Submit comments to NIST

Our review is being undertaken in three stages:

### Stage 1

Activities: All participants perform a high-level, document-wide review
to develop a familiarity with the document. Reviewers should note where
rev 3 has introduced changes and where OWASP has the greatest potential
for impact. Comment development is not required for this stage, but are
a welcome side-effect.

Results: By the first status meeting, each participant should have three
lists: 1) noted updates within the document 2) areas of the document
most closely related to OWASP interests 3) initial draft comments (if
appropriate).

### Stage 2

Activities: Participants will be asked to perform a focused review on
the sections of the document identified in Stage 1 as most relevant to
OWASP. These "target sections" may be divided among project participants
depending on project population and the number of target sections.

Results: By the second status meeting, each participant should develop a
refined and detailed list of comments for their assigned sections.

### Stage 3

Activities: Participants will revise comments as needed and project
management will consolidate and format comments for submission to NIST.

Results: A final list of comments for submission to NIST.

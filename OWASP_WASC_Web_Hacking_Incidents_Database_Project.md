<p>The OWASP WASC Web Hacking Incidents Database Project is a project dedicated to maintaining a list of web applications related security incidents.</p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>WHID goal is to serve as a tool for raising awareness of the web application security problem and provide information for statistical analysis of web applications security incidents. The database is unique in tracking only media reported security incidents that can be associated with a web application security vulnerability. This data is in contrast to many public statistics reports on vulnerability prevalence in that it shows what types of vulnerabilities attackers are actively exploiting.</p>

# FAQs

  - What incidents are included in the Web Hacking Incidents Database?
    The Web Hacking Incident Database only tracks media reported
    security incidents that can be associated with a web application
    security vulnerability. We also try to limit the database only to
    targeted attacks, though the distinction between targeted and
    non-targeted attacks is grey. The database does not include known
    vulnerabilities in web based applications, an area well covered by
    other databases such as CVE, OSVDB or the Bugtraq vulnerabilities
    database. Neither does the database include incidents in which web
    site were breached using operating system or network layer
    vulnerabilities. We also consider most web site defacements as non
    targeted attacks and do not include them in the database. For
    information about web site defacements refer to zone-h.
    As those criteria are somewhat subjective, we welcome comments on
    the inclusion or exclusion of publicized security breaches.

<!-- end list -->

  - Were there only few dozen web hacks last year?
    The criteria for inclusion in WHID are very strict. The goal is to
    list only incidents that are related to web application layer
    vulnerabilities/attacks. The goal is to show that application layer
    security is a risk we cannot ignore anymore.
    Keep in mind, that while there are countless website hacks and
    defacements most are not reported. Even for those reported most of
    the time it is difficult to tell how exactly they occurred.
    Specifically addressing the defacement incidents reported in zone-h,
    bear in mind that in nearly all of these incidents there is no
    public information on the way in which they were carried.
    Additionally, many defacements are not targeted and are the result
    of a wide scan for vulnerable sites and therefore we do not normally
    include defacements in WHID.

<!-- end list -->

  - Why can't I find a well known incident in the database?
    The reason is probably that the incident did not occur due to a web
    application vulnerability, or that we do not know how did it happen.
    For example probably the most well known information security breach
    ever, the CardSystems incident was added only in April 2006, nearly
    a year after it was initially publicized. While we always suspected
    that it was a web hack and industry rumors hinted that, no public
    information regarding the way in which the hack was done was
    available until April 2006. Actually the CardSystems incident was
    brought in previous versions of this FAQ as an example of an
    incident that we would like to add to WHID but cannot. For other
    hacks such information is not available and may not become available
    in the future.

<!-- end list -->

  - How reliable are the incidents reported at WHID?
    The data collected is NOT reported directly to WASC but is rather
    collected from public sources, mostly technical media, mailing list
    post and researchers advisories. As a result the reliability of the
    reported information depends on the source. Since the source (or
    sources) is included with each entry, the reader can assess its
    reliability independently. We do however assess the source before
    including an incident in the database and if for whatever reason
    something we added to the database is found to be erroneous, we
    remove it, though this has ever happened to date.
    For media reported incidents, we're trusting that the reporter or
    news outlet verified the information. For mailing list reported
    incidents and research advisories, these issues are normally quickly
    confirmed our refuted by other subscribers or by the offended
    vendor. In case of doubt evaluate the level of information provided
    in the disclosure and the publishing history of the researcher.

<!-- end list -->

  - Breach vs. Disclosure
    The database includes two types of incidents: "breach" or
    "disclosure". Breaches are incidents in which a web site was
    compromised, while disclosures are incidents in which a researcher
    published a vulnerability in a web site. In other words, breaches
    are incidents in which we know bad guys took advantage of a
    vulnerability, while disclosures are incidents in which we hope the
    good guys were first.

<!-- end list -->

  - The "Unknown" Threat Classification
    All incidents are classified according to the Web Application
    Security Consortium Threat Classification (WASC-TC). This
    classification sheds light on the nature of the security
    vulnerability in the web application.
    Some of the incidents are classified as "Unknown". You may wonder
    why were these incidents included in the list, as there is no way to
    know that the hacker exploited a web application vulnerability. In
    some cases the public information available indicates that the
    incident exploited a web application vulnerability, and in others we
    deducted from the available information.

  - How can I contribute?
    The Web Hacking Incidents Database (WHID) is a community effort. The
    information is provided under the open source Creative Common
    License, which in very simple words says that anyone can use the
    information for whatever need as long as the source is mentioned.
    You can help make WHID better. You don't need to invest a lot of
    time:

<!-- end list -->

  - If you encounter a new Web incident, please use one of the following
    methods to notify the WHID project team:
      - Send an email to - owaspwhid_at_owasp.org
      - Send a tweet to [@owaspwhid](https://twitter.com/owaspwhid)
      - Enter a link in the [WHID Submittal
        Form](https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?formkey=dHktV0FmWGMyTDZPbkZtOEJXNzhPbXc6MQ)
  - As we natively speak English we miss alot in non English speaking
    countries so we are especially looking for non English sources. As
    long as they can be translated using Google translate of a similar
    service, we can include it.
  - If you want to contribute more, become a WHID editor. Send an e-mail
    to the project leader with a few words (and preferably a link) about
    yourself and sign up to this site. We will activate your account and
    enable you to edit incidents. We need you to:
      - Classify incidents a backlog of incidents from 2nd half of 2013.
      - You can help by Proofing/editing the descriptions and
        classifications.

# Road Map and Getting Involved

  - We are always looking for new methods of identifying real-world web
    compromise data sources. If you have any ideas, please contact us.
  - We are also looking for new ways to store and analyze the data.
    Currently we utilize [Google's
    FusionTables](http://tables.googlelabs.com/) to store our raw data.
    If you have recommendations for improvements, please let us know.

Involvement in the development and promotion of WHID is actively
encouraged\! You do not have to be a security expert in order to
contribute. Some of the ways you can help:

  - If you have identified a possible WHID candidate, please use of the
    following methods to notify the WHID project team:

<!-- end list -->

1.  Send an email to - owaspwhid_at_owasp.org
2.  Send a tweet to [@owaspwhid](https://twitter.com/owaspwhid)
3.  Enter a link in the [WHID Submittal
    Form](https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?formkey=dHktV0FmWGMyTDZPbkZtOEJXNzhPbXc6MQ)

<!-- end list -->

  - If you would like to have WRITE access so you can add entries
    directly to WHID in Google FusionTables, contact the project team
    and we will add your Gmail account.

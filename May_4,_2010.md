  - **ESAPI Project Manager** vote from April postponed until June

Approval required to hire OWASP intern for summer. Would be 40 hrs/week
at $10/hr. Intern will provide technical development support to OWASP
projects, currently targeting ESAPI, but we are looking for other high
priority OWASP projects that we should support if the board has other
suggestions. Will work out of the Columbia office under the guidence of
Jeff and Dave.

  - '''Outsourcing OWASP's IT

Clarification of the scope of the RFQ for Dedicated Hosting

  - Is this just moving the 'iron' to another place or is this
    application maintenance as well?
  - Do we also need to look for a hosted Wiki service?
  - What does success look like for this project?

          - **Projects Sponsorship Model**
              - We have received a [email from Softtek that has
                triggered this
                issue](http://docs.google.com/View?id=dcn8962c_81hmcf4rgm)
              - Paulo is proposing we use a model similar to [this
                one](http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Project_Sponsorship)
              - We need to discuss whether or not the policy, that we
                have been pushing to set up but haven’t implemented
                still and under which projects leaders and contributors
                can’t be paid for their work, is to be enforced.
              - We need to discuss and find out one solution to
                acknowledge the sponsor role in those cases in which a
                project leader time is being paid by his employer for
                him to work in a OWASP project.

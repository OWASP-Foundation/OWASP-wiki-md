# Overview

Proposed new membership fees and enhanced benefits for OWASP Members.

# Project Links

Use this section for important links for projects/events that visitors
will need. For instance, if this is an event, links to CFT, CPT and
registration is handy If there is a microsite, that would be good to
link to as well

# Goals

Increase membership while providing a more desirable benefits package to
paying members.

# Milestones

  - Submit new membership fee schedule to the board for approval

  -
  - When milestones are completed, mark them as such with ??

  - A milestone isn’t everyone’s to-do list, it is the high level tasks
    of the project

  - If you have more than 20 milestones, you’re being too granular

# Leadership

  - unordered list of each leader and a hyperlink to their email
    address.

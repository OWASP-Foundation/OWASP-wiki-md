# Overview

Today our institutional name and the events we host are not protected by
copyright. The Foundation will endeavor to register the following marks
in the United States, European Union, and the United Kingdom: OWASP,
Open Web Application Security Project, Global AppSec, and AppSec Days.
Additionally the Foundation will register our figure mark (logo) in
these same three domiciles. Once completed, the Foundation will develop
and share a Trademark Guidelines document for events, chapters, and
projects along with implementing these changes on our websites and event
names. At this time, the Foundation does not expect to fund any
enforcement activities.

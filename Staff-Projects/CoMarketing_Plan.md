# Overview

Proactively identify and pursue the events the Foundation would like to
attend based on our strategy to grow our membership and support. The
plan is strategically to choose one event for each month during the
calendar year. To start all types of events will be included on the
calendar based on the currently available resources. Global AppSec,
regional/local and co-marketing

# Project Links

[Comarketing
Link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_qKVlylUutlTXNTa2p0aDNfdGFvdGhwT2YzMUZNS3ZSdGtF)
Use this section for important links for projects/events that visitors
will need. For instance, if this is an event, links to CFT, CPT and
registration is handy If there is a microsite, that would be good to
link to as well

# Goals

Include top-level goals of the project in an ordered list Give thought
to the ordering of goals. Revenue, attendance, launch date Make sure
goals are measurable from undisputed source

# Milestones

  - In an unordered list (billeted) list major milestones in
    chronological order
  - Use the syntax of 2019-01-19, Milestone name \[Name of Owner\]
  - When milestones are completed, mark them as such with ??
  - A milestone isn’t everyone’s to-do list, it is the high level tasks
    of the project
  - If you have more than 20 milestones, you’re being too granular

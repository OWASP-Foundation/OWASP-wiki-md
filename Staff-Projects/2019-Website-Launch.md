# Overview

Before June 7, the Foundation will launch a new website designed to
engage visitors and professionally convey the value of our collective
work. Rather than just reskinning our current wiki or placing a
simplified landing page in front of our site, we plan to migrate to an
entirely new platform. Website 2.0 must better connect with our
developer audience and be valuable when visited on a variety of devices.
It must be possible for elements of our site to be managed by our
communities or through automation and any platform change must retain
these attributes as well as ensuring continuity of analytics,
permissions design, and redirect of inbound links. A proof of concept
will be complete by April 1. Once Website 2.0 is launched, the wiki will
be maintained through 2020 for historical purposes.

# Goals

1.  Launch Website 2.0 on or before June 7, 2019
2.  Ensure top 500 pages are migrated before May 15, 2019
3.  Redirect for inbound search traffic ready at launch
4.  Retire Mediawiki instance before June 1, 2020

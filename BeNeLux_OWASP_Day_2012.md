<td><p><em>' Secure Web Integration Patterns in the Era of HTML5</em>'<br />
<em>Abstract:</em> Quite a few organizations are finding themselves in a legacy situation with their web applications. Over ten years have passed since the era of dynamic HTML and with the rise of HTML5 and mobile platforms there is now need to gradually move these legacy beasts into a new architecture. Additionally, more and more third party services are offered such as maps, tracking, social media tie-ins, video etc. What are the possible and suitable design patterns for bringing new web, old web, and third party web together? Can we isolate them from each other to secure the new apps from legacy and third party security vulnerabilities? We will dig into the postMessage api, the iframe sandbox directive, CORS, and the same-origin policy while comparing it to the previous generation of integration with jsonp and other hacks.</p></td>

<em>Abstract:</em> The inclusion of third-party scripts in web pages is a common practice. A recent study has shown that more than half of the Alexa top 10 000 sites include scripts from more than 5 different origins. However, such script inclusions carry risks, as the included scripts operate with the privileges of the including website.<br />
In this talk, we propose JSand, a server-driven but client-side JavaScript sandboxing framework. JSand requires no browser modifications: the sandboxing framework is implemented in JavaScript and is delivered to the browser by the websites that use it. Enforcement is done entirely at the client side: JSand enforces a server-specified policy on included scripts without requiring server-side filtering or rewriting of scripts.<br />
Most importantly, JSand is complete: access to all resources is mediated by the sandbox.<br />
We describe the design and implementation of JSand, and we show that it is secure, backwards compatible, and that it performs sufficiently well.<br />

<td><p><strong>Streamlining Application Vulnerability Management: Communication Between Development and Security Teams</strong><br />
<em>Abstract:</em> Identifying application-level vulnerabilities via scanning, penetration tests and code reviews is only the first step in actually addressing the underlying risk. Managing vulnerabilities for applications is more challenging than dealing with traditional infrastructure-level vulnerabilities because they typically require the coordination of security teams with application development teams. The process also means that security managers need to get time from developers during already-cramped development and release schedules. In addition, fixes require changes to custom application code and application-specific business logic rather than the patches and configuration changes that are often sufficient to address infrastructure-level vulnerabilities. This presentation will illustrate the communication difficulties between security and development teams, and how this usually results in unactionable reports and fewer vulnerabilities remediated. In addition, the presentation will walk through an example workflow of addressing application vulnerabilities as software defects. This will be based on freely-available tools and show specific examples of how vulnerabilities can be grouped together, false positives can be culled out, and vulnerabilities transitioned to software defects, as well as how security managers can monitor and verify progress.<br />

<em>Abstract:</em> In the past couple of years security has become a more visible topic in the media. As a result many companies are asking for security reviews in the form of a penetration test. A lot of entrepreneurs took the opportunity to form teams and/or companies that provide such services. There seems to be a lack of clear (standard) legal documentation to cover these activities both for the penetration tester and the company under review. With this panel discussion we would like to discuss this situation and to see if there is a possibility to have a standard document or framework that can be used as a starting point for companies and professionals to use as a contract. The purpose would be to end up with a (set of) documents similar to the “Testaankoop standard huurcontract”, this is a well-known Belgian contract framework for renting a house where both parties are protected and that is clear to both parties. It can be used without further legal intervention.</p></td>

### Body Armor for Binaries, by Asia Slowinska (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam)

*Abstract:*
BinArmor is a novel technique to protect existing C binaries from memory
corruption attacks on both control data and non-control data. Without
access to source code, non-control data attacks cannot be detected with
current techniques. Our approach hardens binaries against both kinds of
overflow, without requiring the pro- grams’ source or symbol tables. We
show that BinArmor is able to stop real attacks—including the recent
non- control data attack on Exim. Moreover, we did not in- cur a single
false positive in practice. On the downside, the current overhead of
BinArmor is high—although no worse than competing technologies like
taint analysis that do not catch attacks on non-control data. Specifi-
cally, we measured an overhead of 70% for gzip, 16%- 180% for lighttpd,
and 190% for the nbench suite.

*Bio:*
I am a postdoctoral researcher in the System and Network Security group
at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, under the guidance of Prof. dr. ir.
Herbert Bos.
I obtained my PhD from the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. My dissertation
Using information flow tracking to protect legacy binaries was completed
under the supervision of Prof. dr. ir. Herbert Bos, while my copromotor
was Prof. dr. ir. Henri E. Bal.
During my PhD studies, I interned twice with Microsoft Research
Cambridge, where I joined the Systems and Performance Group. I also
spent few months interning with the Systems and Security Department at
Institute for Infocomm Research in Singapore.
My research focuses on developing techniques to automatically analyze
and reverse engineer complex software that is available only in binary
form. Further, I’ve been looking into mechanisms that proactively
protect software from malicious activities. Currently, I am involved in
a project on Reverse Engineering of binaries, known as Rosetta.

### Code review for Large Companies, by Ruediger Bachmann (SAP)

*Abstract:*
Static source code analysis should be an essential part in the secure
software development life cycle (SDLC) to start to minimize the number
of potential vulnerabilities already in a very early stage in the
software development process.
The introduction of static code analysis at a large software
manufacturer is a big challenge. In addition to the technical
difficulties – based on the sheer number and size of the software
projects or the number of different programing languages – there are
also non-technical issues like creating new security awareness,
trainings to use the provided tools efficiently and integration of
analysis processes into the software development and maintenance life
cycle.
This talk gives an overview of the company-wide introduction of static
code analysis at SAP AG.
*Bio:*
After graduating with a degree in mathematics and computer science at
the University of Giessen in 1997, Ruediger Bachmann worked at various
software companies and IT service providers mainly in software
development. Currently he is employed at SAP AG in Germany as a
Development Architect in the central code analysis team. There he is
focusing on application security and security code scans.

### OWASP Top 10 vs Drupal, by Erwin Geirnaert (Zion Security)

*Abstract:*
Drupal is the most used and well-known open source content management
system in the world. Created by Dries Buytaert years ago it has grown
with the support of a big community. Drupal 7 is already released and
there is an entire ecosystem for Drupal and Drupal web agencies.
During this presentation we will discuss the findings of an automated
static code analysis of Drupal 6 and Drupal 7 and how Drupal protects
against the OWASP Top 10 Application Security Risks. We will explain the
security weaknesses that remain when you use Drupal and what you can
implement to have a secure cloud server running Drupal.

*Bio:*
Erwin founded ZION SECURITY in 2005 to help companies to protect against
the latest threats, attacks against web applications. ZION SECURITY is

### Secure Web Integration Patterns in the Era of HTML5, by John Wilander (Svenska Handelbanken)

*Abstract:*
Quite a few organizations are finding themselves in a legacy situation
with their web applications. Over ten years have passed since the era of
dynamic HTML and with the rise of HTML5 and mobile platforms there is
now need to gradually move these legacy beasts into a new architecture.
Additionally, more and more third party services are offered such as
maps, tracking, social media tie-ins, video etc. What are the possible
and suitable design patterns for bringing new web, old web, and third
party web together? Can we isolate them from each other to secure the
new apps from legacy and third party security vulnerabilities? We will
dig into the postMessage api, the iframe sandbox directive, CORS, and
the same-origin policy while comparing it to the previous generation of
integration with jsonp and other hacks.
*Bio:*
John Wilander is a frontend software developer at Svenska Handelbanken,
the second strongest bank in the world according to Bloomberg Markets.
He has been researching and working in application security for ten
years and is an active leader in OWASP, the Open Web Application
Security Project. In 2011 he organized the OWASP Summit Browser Security
sessions in Portugal, with participants from the security teams behind

### Streamlining Application Vulnerability Management: Communication Between Development and Security Teams, by Dan Cornell (Denim Group)

*Abstract:*
Identifying application-level vulnerabilities via scanning, penetration
tests and code reviews is only the first step in actually addressing the
underlying risk. Managing vulnerabilities for applications is more
challenging than dealing with traditional infrastructure-level
vulnerabilities because they typically require the coordination of
security teams with application development teams. The process also
means that security managers need to get time from developers during
already-cramped development and release schedules. In addition, fixes
require changes to custom application code and application-specific
business logic rather than the patches and configuration changes that
are often sufficient to address infrastructure-level vulnerabilities.
This presentation will illustrate the communication difficulties between
security and development teams, and how this usually results in
unactionable reports and fewer vulnerabilities remediated. In addition,
the presentation will walk through an example workflow of addressing
application vulnerabilities as software defects. This will be based on
freely-available tools and show specific examples of how vulnerabilities
can be grouped together, false positives can be culled out, and
vulnerabilities transitioned to software defects, as well as how
security managers can monitor and verify progress.

*Bio:*
*Dan Cornell has over fifteen years of experience architecting and
developing web-based software systems. He leads Denim Group’s security
research team in investigating the application of secure coding and
development techniques to improve web-based software development
methodologies.
Dan was the founding coordinator and chairman for the Java Users Group
of San Antonio (JUGSA) and currently serves as the OWASP San Antonio
chapter leader, member of the OWASP Global Membership Committee and
co-lead of the OWASP Open Review Project. Dan has spoken at such
international conferences as RSA, OWASP AppSec USA, and OWASP EU
Research in Greece.*

### Panel discussion about the legal aspects of penetration testing

*with Steven Wierckx, Luc Beirens, Jos Dumortier, Dieter Sarrazyn,
...*

*Abstract:*
In the past couple of years security has become a more visible topic in
the media. As a result many companies are asking for security reviews in
the form of a penetration test. A lot of entrepreneurs took the
opportunity to form teams and/or companies that provide such services.
There seems to be a lack of clear (standard) legal documentation to
cover these activities both for the penetration tester and the company
under review. With this panel discussion we would like to discuss this
situation and to see if there is a possibility to have a standard
document or framework that can be used as a starting point for companies
and professionals to use as a contract. The purpose would be to end up
with a (set of) documents similar to the “Testaankoop standard
huurcontract”, this is a well-known Belgian contract framework for
renting a house where both parties are protected and that is clear to
both parties. It can be used without further legal intervention.

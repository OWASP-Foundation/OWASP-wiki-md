## **Join OWASP ATL via our Meetup Group**

From Jan 2012, we have moved to a [Meetup
group](http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Atlanta/). MeetUp.com will replace
the traditional subscriber email list eventually (referenced above in
the top of this page). It allows us to better communicate with members,
RSVP for events, and announce meetings - all in one place. Click on the
following link to visit our meetup page and signup.

## Latest News

So we have hit a bit of a lull over the past two months as you can
probably tell. August meeting was really low attendance and September
was a non-event since I largely have been out of town and so have a lot
of the other co-leads. Nonetheless, get ready to resume meetings. Next
one is Dec 15th at the Tilted Kilt @ Cumberland. Make a note and check
out details in the Chapter Meetings page above.

FYI - We are trying to reach out to more developers, quality assurance
engineers, and software architects so if you have colleagues in those
areas, please invite them to come. For next meeting information, please
visit the Chapter Meetings tab and RSVP in the link provided.

## Staying in Touch

There is an OWASP Atlanta Linkedin Group. For those addicted to
LinkedIn, we have a group you can further feed your addiction. The OWASP
Atlanta Chapter.
<http://www.linkedin.com/groups?home=&gid=1811960&trk=anet_ug_hm>

The Atlanta mailing list provides a low volume update to monthly events
and also allows for members to post questions related to challenges in
using and adopting OWASP related material/ tools. To join the Atlanta
Mailing List, please sign up here:

## Application Security How-To Articles

This category is for articles describing how to perform a specific
activity that contributes to application security. For example, "How to
test session identifier strength using
[WebScarab](WebScarab "wikilink")." Articles should be titled with a
specific title starting with "How To." Articles can focus in on a
specific topic or be an overview article that references lots of smaller
steps. Long articles should be broken into a set of smaller steps with
an overview article.

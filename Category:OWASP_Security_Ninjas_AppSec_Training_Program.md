# FAQs

'''1. What is special about this project? ''' - This is one of the very
few projects which offers systematic, guided hands-on AppSec training to
folks with very minimal AppSec or Penetration Testing knowledge. This
would not only teach you how to find and exploit vulnerabilities but
also hot to fix them and not have them in the first place\! In today's
world of advancing web attacks and seeing how complicated web
applications are becoming, this training is something that every
software engineer should take.

'''2. How much time does it take to set up the hands on lab? ''' - If
you use the docker build, it takes only a few seconds to setup the lab\!

'''3. Is it hard to setup and destroy the hands-on lab container? ''' -
It is super simple to set up and destroy the container. If use docker,
there are no dependency issues as well, no matter what platform you are
using\!

'''4. Why did I chose Docker? ''' - Setting up and destroying the
environment would be super easy and quick. - The docker container would
be sandboxed which means that the vulnerable application wouldnâ€™t be
able to harm the host OS.

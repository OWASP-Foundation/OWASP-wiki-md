\= Call For Presentations = --\>==Important dates==

  - CFP submission deadline: 15 th august 2017
  - Conference Registration deadline: 5th september 2017
  - Conference Day date: 09th september 2017

For those of you booking flights, ensure you can be at the venue at
9:00am, the conference will end by 6:00pm however we will have post
conference drinks at a local drinking establishment for those
interested.

OWASP Indonesia Day conferences attract a high quality of speakers from
a variety of security disciplines including architects, web developers
and engineers, system administrators, penetration testers, policy
specialists and more.

We would like a variety of technical levels in the presentations
submitted, corresponding to the three sections of the conference:

  - Introductions to various Web Application Security topics, and the
    OWASP projects
  - Technical topics
  - Policy, Compliance and Risk Management

The introductory talks should appeal to an intermediate to experienced
web developer, without a solid grounding in web application security or
knowledge of the OWASP projects. These talks should be engaging,
encourage developers to learn more about web application security, and
give them techniques that they can immediately return to work and apply
to their jobs.

Technical topics are running all day and should appeal to two audiences
- experienced web application security testers or researchers, and web
developers who have a “OWASP Top Ten” level of understanding of web
attacks and defenses. You could present a lightning, short or long talk
on something you have researched, developed yourself, or learnt in your
travels. Ideally the topics will have technical depth or novelty so that
the majority of attendees learn something new.

We would also like to invite talks that will appeal to those interested
in the various non-technical topics that are important in our industry.
These talks could focus on the development of policies, dealing with
compliance obligations, managing risks within an enterprise, or other
issues that could appeal to those in management roles.

We encourage presentations to have a strong component on fixing and
prevention of security issues. We are looking for presentations on a
wide variety of security topics, including but not limited to:

  - Web application security
  - Mobile security
  - Secure development
  - Vulnerability analysis
  - Threat modelling
  - Application exploitation
  - Exploitation techniques
  - Threat and vulnerability countermeasures
  - Platform or language security (JavaScript, NodeJS, .NET, Java, RoR,
    etc)
  - Penetration Testing
  - Browser and client security
  - Application and solution architecture security
  - PCI DSS
  - Risk management
  - Security concepts for C\*Os, project managers and other
    non-technical attendees
  - Privacy controls

\-- The email subject must be "OWASP ID Day CFP" and the email body must
contain the following information/sections:

  - Name and Surname
  - Affiliation
  - Telephone number
  - Email address
  - Short presenter bio
  - Title of the contribution
  - Type of contribution: Technical, Informative, Management
  - Suggested length for the talk
  - Short abstract (up to 500 words)
  - List of the author's previous papers/articles/speeches on the
    same/similar topic (if any)
  - If you are not from Indonesia will your company support your
    travel/accommodation costs? - Yes/No

\--\>

The submission will be reviewed by the OWASP Indonesia Day conference
committee and the highest voted talks will be selected and invited for
presentation.

PLEASE NOTE:

  - Due to limited budget available, expenses for international speakers
    cannot be covered.
  - If your company is willing to cover travel and accommodation costs,
    the company will become "Support Sponsor" of the event.

**Thank you to all those who have submitted talks. The call for
presentations is opening now.**

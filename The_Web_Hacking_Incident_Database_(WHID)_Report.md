"Ryan_Barnett-headshot.jpg")The web hacking incident database (WHID) is
a Web Application Security Consortium project dedicated to maintaining a
list of web applications related security incidents. WHID goal is to
serve as a tool for raising awareness of the web application security
problem and provide information for statistical analysis of web
applications security incidents. The database is unique in tracking only
media reported security incidents that can be associated with a web
application security vulnerability. This presentation will highlight the
statistics gathered from 2010 thus far and provide insight into
categories such as:

1.  Top Attack Methods
2.  Top Compromise Outcomes
3.  Top Target Geographic Region
4.  Top Vertical Markets Hit.

The presenter will also provide some in-depth analysis for specific WHID
entries.

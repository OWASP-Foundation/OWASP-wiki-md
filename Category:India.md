## OWASP AppSec India Latest News

Many thanks to Dhruv Soi and Nitin Saxena who have served as OWASP India
regional coordinators for many years. We welcome a new team in 2016 led
by Milan Singh Thakur. The global foundation would like to note that the
OWASP India chapter and advisory board was dissolved after 2013,
following the tremendous growth in the number of OWASP chapters
throughout India. Dhruv Soi and Nitin Saxena continued in an advisory
role as regional coordinators, but this role should not be construed as
a regional leadership. In other words they are here to advise and
facilitate activity in the region, primarily as organizers for the
upcoming AppSec India conference.

Please feel free to contact any of the Co-Leaders

[Milan](mailto:milan@owasp.org) or

[Deep](mailto:deep.yadav@owasp.org) or

[Mayur](mailto:mayur.agnihotri@owasp.org) to assist with [AppSec
India](https://appsecindia.org) planning.

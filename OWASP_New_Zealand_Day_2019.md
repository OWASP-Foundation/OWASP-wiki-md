## General

The tenth OWASP New Zealand Day will be happening thanks to the support
provided by the University of Auckland, which will kindly offer the same
facilities as those we used in 2018. Entry to the event will, as in the
past, be free.

For any comments, feedback or observations, please don't hesitate to
contact [us](mailto:john.dileo@owasp.org).

## Registration

Registration is now open. Visit
[EventBrite](https://owaspnz2019.eventbrite.com) to register.

Please join our low volume [mailing
list](https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-newzealand) to be
notified as further schedule information becomes available, and/or
follow us on Twitter [@owaspnz](https://twitter.com/owaspnz).

There is no cost for the main conference day. Currently, we are planning
to provide morning and afternoon tea; however, this is subject to
meeting our sponsorship goals for the event. Spaces are limited, so we
do ask that, if at any point you realise you will not be able to attend,
you cancel your registration (i.e., "request a refund" in EventBrite) to
make room for others.

## Places to eat & drink on the day

The University published a handy map (in 2018), to help you find places
to eat around campus: [frame Campus dining
map](File:Retail_Map_City_Campus_2018_v2.pdf "wikilink")

Some of the options available:

  - The Deli - Located on Level 1 of the Owen G. Glenn Building - This
    is closest, but will probably have long lines
  - Mojo Symonds - also on campus
  - Shakey Isles - coffee and food across the road on the corner of
    Symonds & Alfred St
  - The CBD - walk up and over Albert Park to get to the CBD with many
    great food options

<!-- end list -->

  - Fort Street has burgers, kebabs, and KFC
  - High Street & Lorne Street have lots of little cafes and restaurants

<li>

Subway, Starbucks, St. Pierre's Sushi & Pita Pit - walk up Symonds
Street

</li>

<li>

Vulture’s Lane is a popular pub with the InfoSec crowd, there are more
seats downstairs

</li>

<li>

The Bluestone Room - also a popular pub just across Queen St

</li>

</ul>

#### <i>Presentation Video not available, at presenter's request</i>

#### Abstract

Have you ever hired Web developers to make a Web site for you, but then
find out that you don’t actually own the domain name when you checked on
Whois? Find out why this is the case and how we (maybe) should be doing
domain name registrations, by taking a leaf from the law of agency’s
book.

  - For lanyards and tote bags (including Platinum/Gold/Silver
    Sponsors), a single-colour version of the logo should also be
    provided, in a separate file. If a single-colour version of the logo
    is not provided by the sponsor, the OWASP New Zealand Day Committee
    reserves the right to electronically convert the full-colour logo to
    a single-colour version, or omit the sponsor's logo from the
    imprinted items if that proves infeasible.

**Sponsor Banners:**

  - Lobby and stage-side banners are to be provided by the respective
    sponsors, must be free-standing, and their size is subject to
    approval by the OWASP New Zealand Day Committee.
  - The conference venue includes two tracks, conducted in separate
    auditoriums; Platinum Sponsors may display one banner to the side of
    each auditorium's stage; Gold Sponsors may display a banner to the
    side of the stage in one auditorium. Gold Sponsors may express an
    auditorium preference, but final locations are at the discretion of
    the OWASP New Zealand Day Committee.
  - There will be a maximum of four (4) sponsor banners displayed in
    each auditorium, with placement priority given to Platinum Sponsors.

    keys, fidget spinners, etc.

# Diversity Fund

## Diversity and Financial Aid fund

Thanks to the generous support of our lovely sponsors, we have some
funding available to help people from around New Zealand attend the
OWASP NZ Day, who would otherwise find it hard to attend. In particular,
we welcome applications from women, people of colour, LGBTIQ, and all
others. You all deserve to be able to learn more about security, and
we’ll do our best to help make that happen\!

Our funds are limited, and we’ll be reviewing applications every week,
starting at the end of January. Submit your application soon, so we can
approve them promptly, and you’ll be in several review cycles\!

Process:

  - Fill out our [Application
    Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfl4I38Z3ke5H8gYL7KmG9pVY8qIZe3kO5YH_ykALJyvq894w/viewform)
  - We will review and approve applications each week. The first reviews
    will be completed by 29 January.
  - We will contact all applicants and let them know the result of the
    review.
  - Successful applicants will be contacted to help sort things out.

We use the following criteria to help us decide who gets approved:

  - We are biased towards (but not exclusively for) diverse applicants.
  - We do attempt to maximise cost efficiency and will aim to get as
    many people to OWASP as possible, with our limited funds.

Each successful recipient can choose whether to be kept anonymous (in
which case only the OWASP NZ committee will know the details of your
funding), or to be put in touch with the supporting company whose
sponsorship is going towards your attendance. We think some of our
sponsors may enjoy the opportunity to chat with you on the day talk
about your experiences and plans for the future, but that’s totally
optional and up to you.

If you have any questions, feel free to drop us an email:
john.dileo@owasp.org

# Code of Conduct

## Code of Conduct

We want to make the OWASP NZ Day a welcoming environment for all
attendees. To that end, we would like to remind you that all activities
associated with this event are subject to OWASP's [Conference
Policies](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Governance/Conference_Policies).
At their core, these policies are intended to promote and maintain an
inclusive, welcoming environment for all participants - actions
detrimental to that environment are unwelcome.

Speakers, trainers and sponsors have all been reminded of these
policies, and are expected to abide by them like all attendees.

If you have any concerns during the day, please seek out John, Austin,
or Brendan. We will make ourselves visible at the start of the day, so
you know what we look like.

# Call for Presentations - CLOSED

## Call for Presentations

**UPDATE: The Call for Presentations is now CLOSED.** The committee is
reviewing the proposals received, and will be notifying submitters of
their selection status shortly.

OWASP New Zealand Day conferences attract a high quality of speakers
from a variety of security disciplines, including architects, Web
developers and engineers, system administrators, penetration testers,
policy specialists and more.

We would like a variety of technical levels in the presentations
submitted, corresponding to the three focus areas of the conference:

Track One:

  - Introductions to various Information Security topics, and the OWASP
    projects
  - Policy, Compliance and Risk Management

Track Two:

  - Technical topics

Introductory talks should appeal to an intermediate to experienced
software developer, without requiring a solid grounding in application
security or knowledge of OWASP projects. These talks should be engaging,
encourage developers to learn more about information security, and give
them techniques that they can immediately return to work and apply to
their jobs.

This being an OWASP conference, the selection process for talks in Track
One will give priority to those related to OWASP's Projects, Tools, and
Guidance (check out the current \[OWASP Project
Inventory\](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Project\#tab=Project_Inventory)
for more information). If multiple submissions are received related to
the same OWASP Project/Tool, preference will be given to speakers
actively involved as leaders or members of the respective project teams.

Technical topics are running all day and should appeal to two audiences
- experienced software security testers or researchers, and software
developers who have a “OWASP Top Ten” level of understanding of web
attacks and defences. You could present a lightning, short or long talk
on something you have researched, developed yourself, or learnt in your
travels. Ideally the topics will have technical depth or novelty so that
the majority of attendees learn something new.

We would also like to invite talks that will appeal to those interested
in the various non-technical topics that are important in our industry.
These talks could focus on the development of policies, dealing with
compliance obligations, managing risks within an enterprise, or other
issues that could appeal to those in management roles.

We encourage presentations to have a strong component on fixing and
prevention of security issues. We are looking for presentations on a
wide variety of security topics, including but not limited to:

  - Web application security
  - Mobile security
  - Cloud security
  - Secure development
  - Vulnerability analysis
  - Threat modelling
  - Application exploitation
  - Exploitation techniques
  - Threat and vulnerability countermeasures
  - Platform or language security (JavaScript, NodeJS, .NET, Java, RoR,
    Python, etc)
  - Penetration Testing
  - Browser and client security
  - Application and solution architecture security
  - PCI DSS
  - Risk management
  - Security concepts for C\*Os, project managers and other
    non-technical attendees
  - Privacy controls

The submission will be reviewed by the OWASP New Zealand Day conference
committee and the highest voted talks will be selected and invited for
presentation.

PLEASE NOTE:

  - Due to limited funds availability, the conference budget does not
    include a plan to cover expenses for international speakers.
    However, if sponsorship funds are received for this purpose, we will
    issue a call for support applications from those outside New Zealand
    who have submitted proposals. Please indicate in the "additional
    information" section, whether you would be able to present without
    such support.
  - If you are selected as a speaker, and your company is willing to
    cover travel and accommodation costs, the company will be recognised
    as a "Supporting Sponsor" of the event.

Please submit your presentation on
[PaperCall](https://www.papercall.io/owaspnz2019).

<b>Submission Deadline: Friday, 11th January 2019 (NOW CLOSED)</b>

Applicants will be notified in the following week after the deadline,
whether they were successful or not.

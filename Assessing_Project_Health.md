`This is a DRAFT page still under review by the `[`Global``

This page is maintained by the [Global Projects
Committee](Global_Projects_Committee "wikilink") to help assist Project
Leaders with information about successfully running an OWASP Project. It
will be updated from time to time, and changes will be discussed and
announced on the OWASP-Leaders list.

### Project Health Level

Projects almost have a life of their own - beyond the releases they
make. Regrettably the life, and health, of a project cannot be easily
categorized by a single metric. Multiple measures in combination make up
a project's health. Before discussing the method used to rate project
health, lets first cover the levels of health.

  - Level 0 - a project that exists or is just beginning. It is either a
    project with no releases or all releases are no more then Alpha
    quality.
  - Level 1 - a project that has a release at Beta quality. It is a
    project with a release that has been reviewed by at least one
    project leader since Beta quality level is the minimum.
  - Level 2 - a project with at least some of the ratings of health. In
    general, it should have roughly half. It is difficult to be precise
    since the exact number and type of these ratings has not yet been
    determined. As soon as those are solidified, the number for level 2
    will be specified.
  - Level 3 - a project which has all the ratings of health. This level
    represents the most healthy state for an OWASP project.

Notes on Project Health Levels:

1.  The site will be reviewed based on the Project wiki page minimal
    contents below during any level change to ensure minimal project
    information is present on the project site. See below for details.
2.  Maintenance of the project wiki page can be handled by either the
    Project Lead or the Project Maintainer if the project has one.
3.  The ratings of health will be determined shortly. Some general
    information is below. Various logistic and practical aspects need to
    be determined. --[Mtesauro](User:Mtesauro "wikilink") 17:44, 4 May

### Project Health Ratings

The exact meta-data used to determine project health has not yet been
fully determined. Some of the sources of data for the health rating are
listed below. Some, all or none of these may be used in the final
version. This list is to server as a public brainstorming exercise:

  - Number of releases
  - Size of the project's community
  - Industry participation
  - Usability
  - Number of participants
  - Number of "stars" - the idea here is to have a rating system similar
    to what Amazon uses for books, etc.
  - Creation and quality of training/tutorial material for the project.
    The Global Education Committee is a key driver of this potential
    metric.

It is likely and should be expected for this list to change between now
and its final version. Note also that the exact method of gather the
above data is not yet specified.

### Project Wiki Page Minimal Content

The following questions will be answered by the project lead or project
maintainer and be reviewed by the Global Projects Committee whenever a
project changes health levels:

  - Does the project wiki page...

<!-- end list -->

1.  have an up to date project template with current project
    information?
2.  [have a conference style presentation that describes the
    tool/document in at least 3
    slides?](http://globalprojectscommittee.wordpress.com/2009/07/27/what-is-the-3x-slide-presentation-thing/)
3.  [have a one sheet overview document about the
    project?](http://globalprojectscommittee.wordpress.com/2009/07/21/what-is-this-project-flyerpamphlet-thing/)
4.  [have a link to a working mail
    list?](https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo)
5.  have a statement of the application security issue the project
    addresses?
6.  have a project roadmap?
7.  project leaders and main contributors have a wiki account (with its
    user page containing contact details about the user and if possible
    his CV)

For OWASP project wiki pages, please see the Project Wiki Pages section
of the [Guidelines for OWASP
Projects](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Guidelines_for_OWASP_Projects)
for additional suggestions/recommendations.

### Example of the Process

As a example of this process, the story below demonstrates a project
from inception to optimal health:

  - A security professional has an idea to address an issue in
    application security and proposes a new project to the Global
    Projects Committee (GPC).
  - The GPC agrees with the proposal, gathers some initial data from the
    security professional and creates a new project page. The project
    starts at health level 0.
  - The security professional, now the project lead, works on the
    project and creates a release which reaches Alpha quality.
  - The project lead continues to work on the project, it gets reviewed
    and reaches Beta quality. The project has reached level 1. The
    project is generating health metrics.
  - The project lead continues to work on the project release and
    reaches a Stable release.
  - Additional metrics are collected (the exact nature and method of
    collection is to be determined). After reaching approximately half
    of the project health ratings, the project moves to level 2. Note
    this could have happened before creating a stable release.
  - The project lead starts a new sub-project which is Alpha quality.
    The new release does not negatively impact the projects health.
    Likely, it will help it grow and become more healthy.
  - The project grows in activity and prominence to the point that it
    reaches all the project health ratings. The project is now a level 3
    project.

### Archiving Project Sites

The exact criteria for archiving project sites has not yet been
determined. However, the Global Projects Committee sees that an archive
of projects that are kept for historical purposes will be needed. This
page or subsequent pages will determine the situation under which
project pages are archived.

### Pre-existing OWASP projects

The Global Projects Committee realizes that there are many current
project sites which pre-existed the above assessment of project health.
Those project sites will be migrated into the new criteria in the near
future. The exact timing and methodology for addressing existing sites
has not yet been determined. The Global Projects Committee will first
fully specify the new framework before working on mapping existing
projects into the new framework.

### Methodology Follow - Up

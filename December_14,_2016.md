      - Motion: All accounts belonging to active chapters and projects,
        as defined in the Chapter and Project Handbooks respectively,
        with balances less than $500, will be brought to $500 beginning
        January 1, 2017 as long as there are at least two active leaders
        at that time. \[Josh\]
      - Motion: Chapters and projects meeting minimum requirements (two
        leaders, flagship or lab projects) needing funds to host local
        chapter meetings, outreach, or run a local event, such as an
        OWASP Day, can apply for an operating grant of up to $2500 per
        year through the Community Manager, or for larger one off grants
        of up to $10k per year with Board approval. A pool of $100k will
        be allocated for this purpose on an annual basis, with quarterly
        reporting to the Board on its use. Chapter and project leaders
        will be informed of the funds presence every month, and will
        have to supply a written report of their use of funds (such as a
        blog post, meetup page update, or social media post) within 90
        days of using the funds. Grant pool funds not allocated within
        each financial year are not accrued, but topped up to $100k at
        the start of each calendar year. \[AJV\]

<p>OWASP Security Catalyst project is a collection of dummy applications (fully secure and fully vulnerable versions) in various programming languages and platforms including .NET, JAVA, PHP, Android, iPhone, etc, demonstrating implementation of OWASP's secure design and development guidelines.</p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>Vision of this project is to demonstrate the implementation of OWASP's secure design and development guidelines as working applications in all leading programming languages and platforms including .NET, JAVA, PHP, Android, iPhone, etc. All the dummy applications will be available as Fully Vulnerable and Fully Secure versions.</p>
<p>Vulnerable version will highlight the application security vulnerabilities, and can be used for Hands-on practice for application VAPT. At the same time, Secure version of the same application will map OWASP's security development guidelines in the code files, demonstrating secure coding.</p>
<p>User's can not only use the vulnerable apps for VAPT practice, but they will very easily be able to compare the vulnerable code with the secure code, from the secure version of the same application.</p>
<ol>
<li>Security hobbyist, enthusiasts, analysts and testers can use the vulnerable versions of the applications for Hand-on practice.</li>
<li>Developers will also be able to pick up security libraries from our secure version of the applications, to use them in their own applications and projects.</li>
<li>raining organizations can use this project's applications for VAPT and Secure Coding training programs.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is going to be a unique project where ready made secure code/libraries are available in the secure versions of the applications, including all leading programming languages, and will make it very easy and quick for developers to pick and duplicate security implementation in their own applications.</p>

# Road Map

## Q4 2015

1.  Developing "Training Management System" in **JAVA/ORACLE** as
    Vulnerable and Secure versions.
2.  Walk-through/User-guide (preferably videos) for practicing
    vulnerabilities in "Training Management System - Vulnerable"
3.  Walk-through/User-guide (preferably videos) for exploring security
    libraries in "Training Management System - Secure"

## Q1 2016

1.  Developing "Training Management System" in **PHP/MySQL** as
    Vulnerable and Secure versions.
2.  Walk-through/User-guide (preferably videos) for practicing
    vulnerabilities in "Training Management System - Vulnerable"
3.  Walk-through/User-guide (preferably videos) for exploring security
    libraries in "Training Management System - Secure"

## Q2 2016

1.  Developing "Training Management System" in **ASP.NET/C\#/SQL** as
    Vulnerable and Secure versions.
2.  Walk-through/User-guide (preferably videos) for practicing
    vulnerabilities in "Training Management System - Vulnerable"

# FAQs

## How can I participate in your project?

All you have to do is make the Project Leader's aware of your available
time to contribute to the project. It is also important to let the
Leader's know how you would like to contribute and pitch in to help the
project meet it's goals and milestones. There are many different ways
you can contribute to an OWASP Project, but communication with the leads
is key.

## If I am not a programmer can I participate in your project?

Yes, you can certainly participate in the project if you are not a
programmer or technical. The project needs different skills and
expertise and different times during its development. Currently, we are
looking for researchers, writers, graphic designers, and a project
administrator.

# Getting Involved

Involvement in the development and promotion of <strong>OWASP Security
Catalyst Project</strong> is actively encouraged\! You do not have to be
a security expert or a programmer to contribute. Some of the ways you
can help are as follows:

### Coding

We could implement some of the later items on the roadmap sooner if
someone wanted to help out with unit or automated regression tests

### Localization

Are you fluent in another language? Can you help translate the text
strings in the <strong>Code Project Template</strong> into that
language?

### Testing

Do you have a flair for finding bugs in software? We want to product a
high quality product, so any help with Quality Assurance would be
greatly appreciated. Let us know if you can offer your help.

### Feedback

Please use the [Code Project Template project mailing
list](https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/OWASP_Code_Project_Template)
for feedback about:

  - What do like?
  - What don't you like?
  - What features would you like to see prioritized on the roadmap?

"Owasp_logo_normal.jpg")Zeus botnets are trojans accountable for a large
percentage of all trojan infections. Zeusâ€™s availability and ease of use
make it popular amongst malicious individuals with low technical
sophistication. Better social engineering scams, coupled with consistent
levels of victim unawareness and carelessness on the part of software
vendors, have created a need for greater web security. Using a standard
LAMP stack and web programming techniques, a guideline was developed to
mitigate and reduce the exposure of sensitive information from
compromised clients. Because of the resultant confusion, attackers have
either given up and moved on to an easier target, or have spent
significant amounts of resources undoing damage to harvested POST data.
The immediate objective of implementing these new techniques is to
reduce the efficacy of Zeus and its counterparts and ebb cybercrime and
identity fraud. Future use of these techniques will provide better
chances against the compromising of users and web applications.

**AGENDA**

**Title:** **OWASP Limerick - introduction, objectives, meeting
agenda**


19:00 - 19:50
**Title:** **HTML5 - A Whole New Attack Vector** - presented by Robert
McArdle
**Abstract:** HTML5 opens up a wide and wonderful new world for Web
Designers to explore - bringing fantastic new features that were
previously only possible via Flash or horribly over-complicated
Javascript. And HTML5 is not a future technology - chances are your
favourite browser already has excellent support built in (unless you are
still using IE).
In this talk we will look at HTML5 from an attackers view-point. Because
not only does HTML5 bring us Semantic web, editable content, inbuilt
form validation, local storage, awesome video support and the long
overdue death of

<div>

\- it also opens up a host of new opportunities for attackers. We'll
look at some of the troublesome new attacks that this new HTML5 standard
introduces, how attackers can leverage these attacks to cause untold
havoc on your machine, and how - with a little bit of help from some not
so over-complicated Javascript - we can build Botnets in your
Browser\!
**Presenter:** Robert is currently working as the manager of Trend
Micro's Advanced Threat Research team in Europe, where he is involved in
analyzing the latest malware threats, specializing in researching the
future threat landscape and criminal underground. Robert is a regular
presenter for the press and at security conferences. He has also written
and lectures an MSc module in Malware Analysis at Cork IT and UCD, and
is a trainer for several SANS qualifications. A graduate of Trinity and
DCU he holds several qualifications from SANS and serves on the SANS
advisory board.

  - I think this category should be called 'OWASP Tools'
    ([Dinis.cruz](User:Dinis.cruz "wikilink") 17:02, 26 July 2006 (EDT))
      - for now I added a redirect to it (see
        [:Category:OWASP_Tools](:Category:OWASP_Tools "wikilink"))

<!-- end list -->

  -   - Many of the categories are singular so that they can be used as
        tags. If a page describes a vulnerability, you tag it with
        Category:Vulnerability. I think the redirect approach is
        appropriate though. Jeff Williams

# Executive Summary

People often ask us which results of the CISO survey report, we as a
fellow CISOs would find particularly interesting and useful. There are
many good insights and learning points from this report. And the
benefits of it will depend a lot on your own organizationâ€™s maturity and
security status. For some the overall strategic picture of application
security risks and threats is useful to set their security priorities
and strategies for next year, for others the list of best practices and
recommendations from other CISO peers is particularly useful and others
find most valuable to understand which best practices and tools work
best for their peers.

Some of the findings we found interesting to highlight were:

1.  Application security risks are clearly on the rise, in absolute
    numbers and also relative to infrastructure security risks.
2.  Risks from external threats are clearly increasing for
    organizations.
3.  Security awareness and training is the biggest challenge and most
    important priority for CISOs going forward into 2014 (more critical
    than tools, testing or budget).
4.  As we hear from a number of CISOs about difficulties acquiring an
    adequate budget, it appears that having a 2-year security strategy
    improves your chances for getting or increasing your security
    budget/investments.
5.  Only about one fourth of organizations currently have some form of
    application security management system or maturity model. But over
    40% are looking at this for the coming 12 months. So there might be
    a lot of activity in this area in the near future, and we hope one
    of our OWASP projects, openSAMM (Open Software Assurance Maturity
    Model), can help executives with that.

Beyond these points, you will find this report contains many more
interesting facts and findings and we hope that you will find many of
them interesting and helpful for your daily work as a CISO, giving you
the right data for defining your security strategies and priorities for
the future. We are confident that like 2013, the coming year 2014 will
be an interesting year with many challenges in web and application
security and hope that we as OWASP can provide you and your
organizations with good intelligence and help you with many of our free
documentation and tools to manage your security programs better and
overall improve application security around the world.

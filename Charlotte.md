## Local News

  - One of our projects,
    [AppSensor](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSensor_Project)
    headed by lead developer and local member John Melton, was selected
    as a GSOC project. This is a very exciting new feature that will
    pave the way for a server/client model of
    [AppSensor](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSensor_Project).

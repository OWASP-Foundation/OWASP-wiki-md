## Active tasks (with owner)

  - Contact all OWASP Corporate members and invite them to Summit (with
    OWASP covering accommodation and training cost of 1 person (we call
    this the VIP pass)) - Eoin
  - Support the Key Working Session:
    [ISWG:_Browser_Security](OWASP_EU_Summit_2008_Working_Sessions#ISWG:_Browser_Security "wikilink")
    . The first step is to get Arshan to complete the action plan so
    that we start contacting all major Browser developers (Kuai Hinojosa
    - I will work with Arshan on this)
  - Support the key Working Session:
    [ISWG:_Web_Application_Framework_Security](OWASP_EU_Summit_2008_Working_Sessions#ISWG:_Web_Application_Framework_Security "wikilink")
    . The first step is to get Arshan to complete the action plan so
    that we start contacting all major Web Framework developers (Kuai
    Hinojosa - I will work with Arshan on this)
  - Sort out a solution for remote dial-in for contributors that are not
    able to go to the Summit. There needs to be a technological solution
    (Skype?, equipment required on the day?) together with a process
    (where will people dial-in?) and people (who will participate? (I
    like the idea that people have to pre-register before the event, so
    that we keep track on who is going where (maybe we can even dial out
    (Skype) from the Summit, or only give the name of the Skype account
    used to the remote people who participate) (Seba)
  - Liase with Lulu in order to prepare a store at the event (Being
    worked by Eduardo Neves)

## To Do List (no owner)

    might still be interested in the conference (following Brandi's
    comments)

`"I am interested in application security BUT I am not a technical developer--I am a manager of a team inside the security group who now has to think about appsec.`
`"... I have run into a few folks like this in my travels around ... and I see very clearly how this peripheral audience has great interest in what we offer but looks at the listing `
`of talks and does not see a good path of how to be involved.  We even see this at chapter meetings here in ...--execs and managers come out when there is a wider net around the talk. ...`

  - Support the Key Working Session:
    [OWASP_Advisory_Board](OWASP_Advisory_Board "wikilink") . The

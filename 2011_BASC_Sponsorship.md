BASC 2011 has three levels of sponsorship: Platinum, Gold and Silver,
and it's simple to become a sponsor (to pay by credit card register at

and the digital and printed presence below:

  - a 6 or 8 foot table in the main hallway with access to power
  - logo placement on the conference web site (the site will be
    permanent and have links to the presentations, podcasts, images and
    videos from the conference)
  - logo placement on the conference program provided to each attendee

<!-- end list -->

  - lunch, breakfast and two drink tickets for each sponsor exhibitor

    web site,

BASC 2010 had 210 registered and about 110 actual attendees. We expect
significantly more attendees in 2011 due to conference reputation,
earlier publicity, and a conference date not near Thanksgiving.

Sponsorship is completely independent of and unrelated to speaking
slots. OWASP does not allow distribution of attendee lists, or use of
them for anything other than conference updates. OWASP is a 501c3
not-for-profit worldwide charitable organization.

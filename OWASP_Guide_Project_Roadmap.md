The project team is setting out to make the Development Guide useful as
a list of appropriate controls for the creation of web applications,
SOAP and REST web services and Ajax front ends.

## Current status

The current draft has a great deal of material ready to be donated to
the ADSR and other Guides. These will be shifted by Kirsten Sitnick, our
technical editor.

The remaining material needs to be re-written to be consistent in form
throughout, and concentrate solely on controls. If there are issues with
a particular control, these should be highlighted in the Testing or Code
Review Guide, with only a short explanation in the Development Guide.

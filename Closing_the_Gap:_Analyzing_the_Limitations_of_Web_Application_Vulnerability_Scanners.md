"Owasp_logo_normal.jpg")The threat of cyber attacks due to improper
security is a real and evolving danger. Corporate and personal data is
breached and lost because of web application vulnerabilities thousands
of times every year. Web application vulnerability scanners are tools
that can be used by network administrators and security experts to help
prevent and detect vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site
scripting, and session hijacking. However, these tools have been found
to have flaws and limitations. Research has shown that web application
vulnerability scanners are not capable of always detecting
vulnerabilities and attack vectors, and do not give effective
measurements of web application security. This paper presents a method
to analyze the flaws and limitations of several of the most popular
commercial and free/open-source web application scanners by using a
secure and insecure version of a custom-built web application. Our
described method allows us to recommend improvements to web application
scanner techniques that reduce the number of false-positive and
false-negative results.

<p>The Tool Project Template is simply a sample project that was developed for instructional purposes that can be used to create default project pages for a Tool project. After copying this template to your new project, all you have to do is follow the instructions in red, replace the sample text with text suited for your project, and then delete the sections in red. Doing so should make it clearer to both consumers of this project, as well as OWASP reviewers who are trying to determine if the project can be promoted to the next category. The information requested is also intended to help Project Leaders think about the roadmap and feature priorities, and give guidance to the reviews as a result of that effort.</p>
<p>Creating a new set of project pages from scratch can be a challenging task. By providing a sample layout, with instructional text and examples, the OWASP Tool Project Template makes it easier for Project Leaders to create effective security projects and hence helps promote security.</p>

# FAQs

## How can I participate in your project?

All you have to do is make the Project Leader's aware of your available
time to contribute to the project. It is also important to let the
Leader's know how you would like to contribute and pitch in to help the
project meet it's goals and milestones. There are many different ways
you can contribute to an OWASP Project, but communication with the leads
is key.

## If I am not a programmer can I participate in your project?

Yes, you can certainly participate in the project if you are not a
programmer or technical. The project needs different skills and
expertise and different times during its development. Currently, we are
looking for researchers, writers, graphic designers, and a project
administrator. See the Road Map and Getting Involved tab for more
details.

## Contributors

The OWASP Tool Project Template is developed by a worldwide team of
volunteers. A live update of project [contributors is found
here](https://github.com/OWASP/Security-Principles/graphs/contributors).

The first contributors to the project were:

  - [Colin Watson](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/User:Clerkendweller)
    who created the OWASP Cornucopia project that the template was
    derived from
  - [Chuck Cooper](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/User:Chuck_Cooper)
    who edited the template to convert it from a documentation project
    to a Tool Project Template
  - **YOUR NAME BELONGS HERE AND YOU SHOULD REMOVE THE PRIOR 3 NAMES**

## Roadmap

As of <strong>November, 2013, the highest priorities for the next 6
months</strong> are: <strong></strong>For now the Road Map will be :

Handle Exeception, Add banner, Add more modules from MSF, Optimize Code.

  - Complete the first draft of the Tool Project Template
  - Get other people to review the Tool Project Template and provide
    feedback
  - Incorporate feedback into changes in the Tool Project Template
  - Finalize the Tool Project template and have it reviewed to be
    promoted from an Incubator Project to a Lab Project

Subsequent Releases will add <strong>

  - Internationalization Support
  - Additional Unit Tests
  - Automated Regression tests

</strong>

## Getting Involved

Involvement in the development and promotion of <strong>Tool Project
Template</strong> is actively encouraged\! You do not have to be a
security expert or a programmer to contribute. Some of the ways you can
help are as follows:

### Coding

We could implement some of the later items on the roadmap sooner if
someone wanted to help out with unit or automated regression tests

### Localization

Are you fluent in another language? Can you help translate the text
strings in the <strong>Tool Project Template</strong> into that
language?

### Testing

Do you have a flair for finding bugs in software? We want to product a
high quality product, so any help with Quality Assurance would be
greatly appreciated. Let us know if you can offer your help.

### Feedback

Please use the [Tool Project Template project mailing
list](https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/OWASP_Tool_Project_Template)
for feedback about:

  - What do like?
  - What don't you like?
  - What features would you like to see prioritized on the roadmap?

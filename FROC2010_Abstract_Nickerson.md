## The Presentation: "YOU are the WEAKEST link"

Had enough SQLi,CSRF,XSS, and other code talk today? There is an EASIER
and FASTER way. Throw away the fuzzers, drop the massive toolset and
hours of beating your head against the wall. Ignore the scanners and let
your whitehat/greyhat methodology have a rest. In this talk, we will
talk about the path of least resistance, the people. Do you REALLY think
that attackers are gonna send a TON of traffic at your app and fuzz it
al day long? NOPE\! They are gonna go after the source. Not the source
code, the DEVELOPERS. We will go through how to profile developers,
track them, and find out what REALLY goes on behind the curtain.

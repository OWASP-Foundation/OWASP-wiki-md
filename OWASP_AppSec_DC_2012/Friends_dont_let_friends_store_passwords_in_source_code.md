## The Presentation

Passw3rd is a encryption library intended to encrypt and store passwords
outside of source code. This is a problem that has been solved in
hundreds of half-baked ways, or it is a problem that is often
overlooked.
Some advantages of keeping credentials out of source code are:
Credentials are not passed around when source code is shared.
Unintentional exposure of source code does not reveal credentials.
Read-access to source code can be much more permissive. Source code can
be checked into version control systems without concern for exposure of
credentials. It is easier to change credentials without having to worry
about changing all instances. Leaving credentials in source code leads
to poor password management in general. If changing a credential
requires you to change code, you are less likely to want to do it.

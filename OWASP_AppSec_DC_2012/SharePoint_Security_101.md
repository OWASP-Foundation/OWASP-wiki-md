## The Presentation

SharePoint is big, very big. In fact, it is one of the fastest growing
products in Microsoft's history, achieving more than a billion in
revenue in 2009. This represents a 30% year-over-year growth. As one
analyst ominously described, _SharePoint is like a virus growing inside
the organization.' But the real question is this: How did Microsoft take
into account security when building SharePoint? Given Microsoft's spotty
record in security, when it comes to SharePoint, Britney may have
summarized it best: _Ooops, I did it again.' This talk will: -
Highlight common SharePoint use cases and their key security issues. -
Prescribe the mitigation steps every enterprise should take minimize the
odds of a breach.

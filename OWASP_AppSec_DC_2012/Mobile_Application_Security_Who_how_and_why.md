## The Presentation

This will be a continuation and expansion of the Android Security talk
and presentation from AppsecUSA in September 2011. It will include new
material on the mobile threat-scape, new material on iOS and additional
examples from real life mobile penetration tests conducted by SpiderLabs
Application Security Services.
The talk start with a general review of the security landscape by
Charles Henderson, with reference to our latest Global Security report
and how it applies to the mobile application space. This will include
who is doing the attacking and why. It will touch on the target rich
environment in mobile applications as well the types of applications
targeted
The talk will then move on to concrete examples of how and why mobile
applications and platforms are susceptible to the kind hacking and
attacking just presented.
Stating with an overview of iOS, the iPhone\\iPad platform and they ways
it is attacked will be presented, including why data is leaked and how
developers can defend against it.
The presentation will then continue into explaining how Android is
different - not better or worse, but merely different. Again, touching
on how Android is attacked, how data is leaked and how developers can
defend on this platform.
The talk will wrap up the talk by speculating about the future of mobile
security and mobile application penetration testing.
Throughout the presentation, real-world (though, obviously, sanitized)
examples from real penetration tests conducted over the past few years
at SpiderLabs will be used as illustrations. Where appropriate, there
will be demonstrations of some of points with live or recorded demos of
the issues and techniques discussed.
As usual, there to be a lively discussion and tough questions following
the talk.

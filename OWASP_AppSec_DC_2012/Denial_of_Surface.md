## The Presentation

Are industrial systems airgapped?
Some are, some aren't. Unfortunately, enough of them aren't...to suggest
bigger questions. Shodan has provided us with over 10,000 proofs of ICS
connectivty, and visualization is the key to this story. More
importantly, this data was provided to ICS-CERT to help mitigate such
exposure. That data was in turn shared globally with other CERTS and
CSIRTS, and the lessons are still being learned.
It's time to re-examine the fantasy of the airgap, and think of ways to
do vulnerability and exposure management in vendor and owner agnostic
ways. More importantly, how do you do vulnerability management at a
national or international scale?
This is not a story of 'I found a couple scary things in SHODAN'. This
is a theory of the underlying cause for being able to find THOUSANDS of
ICS devices and logins on the open internet. Complete with open source
eye-candy\!

### Eireann Leverett

![AppSecDC12-leverett.jpg](AppSecDC12-leverett.jpg
"AppSecDC12-leverett.jpg")Eireann Leverett is NOT a PhD student at
Cambridge, despite recent propaganda to the contrary. He did grow up in
DC though, and is looking forward to coming back in style.

He started academic life studying Philosophy and Psychology, and then
moved on to Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering. His most
recent project comes from his MPhil in Advanced Computer Science which
apparently he survived.

He's been an OWASP, circus, and hackerspace activist for a few years,
and likes security projects in the real world. His fans include his mom,
her dog, the deuteragonist Jiminy Cricket, and a couple Amish mimes
living in Norway.

He currently scrapes out a living inventing ridiculous bios in the third
person, because he hasn't really done anything yet.

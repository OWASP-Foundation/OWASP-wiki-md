## The Presentation

I will cover the current state of web based attacks as we see them
monitored on our network. In total somwhere around 1 million+ domains
are attacked and monitored on our network, so the sample of data
provided should be acceptably accurate.
The data will be provided in the presentation using statistical data of
logged attacks against our network and customer's sites (and can be
provided to security researchers in a raw formet). This will provide the
audience with a knowledge of how severe a new exploit can become once
attackers utilize it, as well as details on what types of attacks are
popular with malicious parties.
Time allowing, we will discuss a detailed dissection of a handful of
common backdoors we see on our network (of course choosing the most
unique and interesting backdoors we encounter.) This is not to help the
audience on how to design backdoors, but instead provides a basic
overview of these attacker's knowledge and intent (why the bad guys do
the things they do.)

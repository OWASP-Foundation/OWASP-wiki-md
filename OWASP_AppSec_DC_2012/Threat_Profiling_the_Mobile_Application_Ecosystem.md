"Owasp_logo_normal.jpg")The flood gates of the mobile age have swung
wide open, and whether your organization is prepared or not - mobile
applications utilizing cloud resources are the future. As organizations
race to release Çmobile versions of applications that do everything
from home automation to managing your medications and health history,
software security assurance is paramount from both regulatory and risk
management perspectives. This requires an entirely different approach
than simply running scans or handing off your source code to be
Çaudited. Analyzing the source code, the mobile application, remote
application interfaces and the communication protocols between them are
critical to understanding the complete threat profile of the mobile
application. Simply looking at one of these components can provide a
dangerously misleading representation and lead to increased risk
exposure. The speaker will discuss the full threat profile of mobile
applications, including their real attack surface and provide thoughts
on the future of mobile applications as enterprises migrate further into
cloud computing.

## The Presentation

OWASP Enterprise Security API (ESAPI) for C Plus Plus
ESAPI is a free, open source, application security control library that
makes it easier for programmers to write lower-risk applications. This
presentation will give background on the ESAPI project as a whole, and
focus on the C++ specific version. The initial ESAPI for C++ release is
planned to happen in April 2012 and will be cross-platform, and compiler
agnostic.
Key points:
\-ESAPI Project Overview -ESAPI for C Plus Plus -Integrating Security
Controls (DEMO) -ESAPI Future (3.0)
The ESAPI Project Overview will summarize what an Enterprise Security
API is, why it is needed, and how it is meant to be incorporated into an
application architecture.
Why is building an ESAPI for C++ necessary and relevent to developers?
What approach has been taken to building the C++ API, and how does this
relate to other ESAPI projects? Lots of thought has been put into the
architecture and libraries that are being used in the ESAPI for C++.
This presentation will provide details on the project and it's current
state, as well as future plans, and how to get involved.
Integrating Security Controls will be a short demonstration on how to
use the ESAPI for C++ to add security to a vulnerable application.
The ESAPI project is continuing to evolve and there are exciting plans
for the 3.0 specification. This will include an ESAPI Community, a
Pluggable Architecture, and lots of Documentation and Tutorials.

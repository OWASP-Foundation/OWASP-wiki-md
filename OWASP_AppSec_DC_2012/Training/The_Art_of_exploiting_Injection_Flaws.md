## Description

**Course Length: 2 Day**

OWASP rates injection flaws as the most critical vulnerability within
the Top 10 most Critical Web Application Security Risks under the OWASP
Top 10 project. <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2010-A1>



This hands-on session will only focus on the injection flaws and the
attendees will get an "in-depth" understanding of the flaws arising from
this vulnerability. The topics covered in the class are:



SQL Injection
XPATH Injection
LDAP Injection
Hibernate Query Language Injection
Direct OS Code Injection
XML Entity Injection
The workshop covers classical issues such as SQL Injection, which is an
oldie yet very relevant in today's scenario as well as some lesser known
injection flaws such as LDAP, XPATH and XML Injection.

During the 2 days course, the attendees will have access to a number of
challenges for each flaw and they will learn a variety of exploitation
techniques used by the attackers in the wild. Identify, extract,
escalate, execute; we have got it all covered.

## Description

**Course Length: 1 Day**

Web applications continue to be the frontier of wide-spread security
breaches. This tutorial will guide through development practices to
ensure the security and integrity of web applications, in turn
protecting user data and the infrastructure the application runs on.
Several attack types and risks will be reviewed (including OWASP?s Top
10), along with how the proper development practices can mitigate their
damage. Although examples covered are PHP-based, much of the content is
also applicable to other languages.

## Objectives

Audience: Technical, Operations, Enthusiast
Skill Level: Intermediate

Attendees will gain the knowledge required to develop secure web
applications, along with an understanding of various attack types
against web apps and how they are mitigated by the proper coding
techniques. The main learning objectives are:
1\. Developing the skills for securely coding web applications
2\. Reviewing existing web vulnerabilities and their impact
3\. Understanding how the proper development techniques mitigates known

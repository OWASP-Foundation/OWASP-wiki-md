## The Presentation

The OWASP Broken Web Applications (OWASP BWA) Project produces a free
and open source virtual machine (VM) containing more than twenty web
applications with a variety of security vulnerabilities. The project VM
is well suited for use as a learning environment and as a standard
target for testing tools and techniques. After two years of betas, the
project is proud to announce its first major release. This talk will
provide an overview of the project, the features in the 1.0 release, and
the vision for the project's future.

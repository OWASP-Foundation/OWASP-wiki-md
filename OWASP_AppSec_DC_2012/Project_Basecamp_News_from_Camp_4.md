## The Presentation

For over a decade the control systems security community has been
quietly saying that controllers are fragile devices that should not be
scanned or fuzzed. The community debated for years about proper
disclosure methods, yet the control systems themselves have seen little
improvement. Project Basecamp rocked the community by releasing detailed
vulnerability reports about the systems used in critical infrastructure,
as well as tools needed to exploit those vulnerabilities.
Like the climbers in Yosemite, the Project Basecamp team is not going
away. In Camp 4, Reid covers new industrial controller vulnerabilities,
exploits, and vendor responses to the disclosures.

"AppSecDC12-wightman.jpg")Reid Wightman has worked offensive and
defensive security for the Department of Defense and the private sector.
He cut his teeth in the ICS space working for Schweitzer Engineering
Laboratories, where he demonstrated reverse engineering techniques
against industrial controllers to drive production of more secure
products. Since joining Digital Bond, Reid has been actively reverse
engineering industrial control systems to find their design flaws,
backdoors, and other security limitations

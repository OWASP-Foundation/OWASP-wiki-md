## The Presentation

Bayesian text classifiers have long been been successful in the fight
against email SPAM. Why can't these same methods be used to help prevent
against web-based attack payloads? This talk will demonstrate a working
bayesian analysis system within the ModSecurity open source web
application firewall which uses the Lua API to both classify and test
payloads to identify attacks.

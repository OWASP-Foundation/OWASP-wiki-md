## The Presentation

Mobile devices and the security risks introduced by the software that
runs them are proliferating, especially with the open and fragmented
Android ecosystem. This talk scrutinizes challenges faced in securing
mobile apps, and contrasts them with legacy and more mature software
security initiatives. We discuss how consumerization confounds security
efforts, how the mobile app lifecycle makes risk a hot potato, and
finish with the top mobile threats and how to avoid them.
Jacob West is Director, Software Security Research for the Enterprise
Security Products division of Hewlett-Packard. West is a
world-recognized expert on software security and brings a technical
understanding of the languages and frameworks used to build software
together with extensive knowledge about how real-world systems fail. In
2007, he co-authored the book "Secure Programming with Static Analysis"
with colleague and Fortify founder Brian Chess. Today, the book remains
the only comprehensive guide to static analysis and how developers can
use it to avoid the most prevalent and dangerous vulnerabilities in
code. West is a frequent speaker at industry events, including RSA
Conference, Black Hat, Defcon, OWASP, and many others. A graduate of the
University of California, Berkeley, West holds dual-degrees in Computer
Science and French and resides in San Francisco, California.

## The Presentation

The ICS security, or the lack of, has been hogging the titles during the
last months. The underlying issue behind this fact is that, in a
post-stuxnet era, the industrial control systems are facing a totally
new scenario, they are not a safe place anymore but a potential and
valuable target. A lot of questions arise, but maybe the most important
one is: are they prepared to face this threat? This presentation details
the whole process of analyzing industrial devices, including methods
such as reverse engineering and open source intelligence.
The results of this approach are also elaborated, showing real cases of
backdoors found on widely deployed PLCs and SmartMeters

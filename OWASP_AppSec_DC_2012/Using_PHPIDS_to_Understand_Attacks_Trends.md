## The Presentation

Abstract: As described by it's author, PHPIDS "is a simple to use, well
structured, fast and state-of-the-art security layer for your PHP based
web application." As an open source project it provides web site owners
unfamiliar with traditional log analysis an easy way to learn of attacks
against their site. This presentation will provide an overview of PHPIDS
as well as instructions for incorporating it into your web
infrastructure. Specifically, the talk will start with a detailed
description of PHPIDS, including it's architecture and operational flow.
Next, the discussion will turn to the basics of installing, configuring,
and testing it for any PHP web application. Finally, the presenter will
provide insight into operations and maintenance of PHPIDS from over two
years of use, including calibration, signature updates, incident
response, and attack trends.

Bio: Salvador Grec has over 16 years experience, undergraduate and
graduate degrees in Electrical Engineering, and a really well known
security certification. Even though his training was in Electrical
Engineering, Sal has always been more of a Computer Science person at
heart going back to his VIC-20, Commodore 64, and high school computer
club days. After doing the IT grind for 5 years, he discovered his love
of infosec and has been pursuing this career ever since. Currently, he
spends his days doing cyber security paperwork drills in building and
maintaining multi-billion dollar government systems. At night he runs a
local infosec website and tries to get some hands-on skillz.
Note: I am open to other talk formats as well (e.g., Turbo Talk).

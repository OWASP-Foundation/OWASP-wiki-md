## The Presentation

Government leaders are operating on reduced budgets and uncertain
futures. In this session, we will discuss the costs associated with
current software assurance practices and present new research on how a
software security assurance (SSA) program, supported by policy and
contracting, translates into reduced risk and development costs.
In this joint session, John Keane, title, Military Health Services, (the
largest hospital system in the U.S.), and Rob Roy, Federal CTO, HP
Enterprise Security Group, will share the secrets for obtaining
consensus among senior management for a high profile and successful SSA
project. They will also discuss bridging the gap between government
contractors and vendors when it comes to software quality: learn what
requirements MHS has set for its vendors, the tools it requires they use
to eliminate security defects and how this process ensures that the
organization is purchasing only the cleanest, most secure software.

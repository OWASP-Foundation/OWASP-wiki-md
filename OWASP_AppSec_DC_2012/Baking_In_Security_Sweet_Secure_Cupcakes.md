## The Presentation

This talk demonstrates the lessons learned while implementing
application security into an already highly successful and talented
development process moving at the speed of light and with infinite
energy. Matt and Ken will discuss everything from the psychology to the
economics involved in bringing an application security program into a
start-up-rich environment full of creativity and intelligence, all while
finding the balance between security and culture, a time honored
_AppSec-Crusade'.
This 45 minute presentation will share some of LivingSocial's recipes
for success in building an application security program. Matt and Ken
will discuss what changes were successful and what changes resulted in
confection sugar explosions as they worked to spice up LivingSocial's
incredibly talented engineering team and show them the way to security.
Matt and Ken will disclose the ingredients, which comprise their secret
recipes, and how you can bake application security into your development
program. From the 3-person development shop to the 300-strong, we're
sure you'll find the right flavor.

<p>The Lazarus, Silent Chollima, Group 123, Hidden Cobra, DarkSeoul, Blockbuster, Operation Troy and 10 Days of Rain attacks are all believed to originate from North Korea. But how can they be attributed with certainty? And what connection does a DDoS and disk-wiping attack from 4 July 2009 have with WannaCry, one of the largest cyber attacks in the history of the cyber sphere?</p>
<p>From the Mydoom variant Brambul, to the more recent FallChill, WannaCry, and targeting of cryptocurrency exchanges, there is a distinct timeline of attacks beginning from the moment North Korea entered the world stage as a significant threat actor. Bad actors have a tendency to unwittingly leave fingerprints on their attacks, allowing researchers to connect the dots between them. North Korean actors have left many of these clues in their wake and throughout the evolution of their malware arsenal. In this session, attendees will view code analysis illustrating key similarities between samples attributed to North Korea, a shared networking infrastructure, and other revealing data hidden within the binaries. All of these puzzle pieces will be put together and using a VR demo to illustrate the connections between the many attacks attributed to North Korea and to categorize different tools used by specific teams of their cyber army.</p>

<p><strong>Talk 1: Gavin O’Gorman</strong></p>
<p>Gavin has been working in Symantec for the past nine years, Gavin is an intelligence analyst on the attack investigations team. Before moving to the attack investigations team in 2013, he worked as a reverse engineer, and as an incident handler. Gavin's primary role is to gather together information from both Symantec data sources, and open sources, to build a comprehensive picture of an attack, or attackers. Another aspect of the job is to work with law enforcement to assist in the investigation of e-crime where possible. Prior to working in Symantec, Gavin spent several years researching network security in Dublin City University, and currently lectures part-time for the DCU Masters in Security &amp; Forensics course</p>
<p><em>Talk Description - "Exploring the Digital Underworld"</em><br />
Gavin will be talking about how over the past year, researchers in Symantec have been tracking a group they refer to as Hayworm. From what appeared to be a disparate set of unrelated victims, Symantec researchers have been able to identify the operators behind these attacks, and their motivation. Gavin will describe the investigation, including how the attackers work, and how researchers managed to identify them.</p>
<p><strong>Talk 2: Eamonn Ryan</strong></p>
<p>Eamonn has been working with McAfee for 2.5 years and has been working within the security realm for 5 years. He has worked in a blue team environment and also in a more red team focused role so can see both sides of the equation!</p>
<p><em>Talk Description - "Mitre Att&amp;ck Technique Automation"</em></p>
<p>If you are following security news recently, you may have heard about the Mitre Att&amp;ck Framework. Mitre describe it as follows: "MITRE ATT&amp;CK™ is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. The ATT&amp;CK knowledge base is used as a foundation for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in the private sector, in government, and in the cybersecurity product and service community.". Eamonn has been utilizing this framework and automating the respective techniques. This talk will describe and demonstrate these automations, with a focus on some of the hacking techniques mentioned during Gavin's talk.</p>

<p>This chapter meeting will be delivered by Gabriel Lawrence who will be speaking about object deserialization bugs within some of the most popular programming languages, web servers and sites. This is a major application security vulnerability which he and Chris Frohoff advanced the research and released generalized exploit tools at AppSec Cali 2015. It was almost a year later, when specific working exploits were released across many major Java services, that the world realized how much of a big deal the findings from their research into deserialization were. Sites including PayPal and a number of Java based systems including WebLogic, Websphere, JBoss and Jenkins were found to be remotely exploitable to provide the attacker with full remote access to the associated server. To this day, and without a doubt well into the future, desearialization vulnerabilities will continue to be discovered as a result of this work.</p>

<td style="text-align: center;"><p>On Thursday November 12th we have two great speakers lined up for our next chapter meeting. Both posses great experience in their respective areas, so can get across the information and answer your questions that might not be so easy to find in the books. Stephen O'Boyle will talk about PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry - Data Security Standard), the set of compliance guidelines that you must adhere to if you store, transmit or process credit card information. This will be followed up with Barry Mulcahy's valuable information on management of identity and access to data across systems.</p>
<p>Also, thanks to the kind sponsorship from Espion on the night there will be some food and drinks provided too. No doubt, this should be a great night :)</p>
<p><strong>Talk #1 - PCI DSS v3.1 Scanning and Penetration Testing</strong></p>
<p>Stephen will discuss the key changes in PCI DSS Version 3.1, examine penetration testing methodology from the auditor’s point of view, and how you can maintain compliance.</p>
<p>Key Takeaways will include</p>
<p>∙ PCI DSS Pentest / Scanning overview</p>
<p>∙ Migrating from V2 to V3.1</p>
<p>∙ Changes to penetration testing requirement 11.3</p>
<p>∙ Scanning vs pen testing</p>
<p>∙ What the auditor expects from pen testing</p>
<p>∙ Example methodology</p>
<p><strong>Speaker Bio: Stephen O'Boyle</strong></p>

Stephen has worked across a wide range of industry verticals, including government, financial, education and technology.</p>
<p><strong>Talk #2 - Identity and Access Management (IAM)</strong></p>
<p>This talk will focus on Identity and Access Management (IAM), what it is and how it fits into the security landscape. It will outline the lifecycle of an identity (Hello new hire Alice!). How we move from having an identity to having access. Some of the common pitfalls encountered during IAM integration projects. Analytics techniques for IAM that smooth the integration path, validate controls and provide valuable Business Intelligence (BI) that are useful for process improvement and security auditing. The talk will conclude by looking at some of the recent trends in IAM and some pointers for the future.</p>
<p><strong>Speaker Bio: Barry P. Mulcahy</strong></p>
<p>Barry received a B.Sc. in computer science from UCC in 2001 and a Ph.D. in distributed security systems from UCC in 2008.

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>On Thursday, October 15th, we are holding the last of our free series of workshops based on OWASP's most well known flagship project, the OWASP Top 10 (2013) <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top10">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top10</a>. The goal of these workshops is to learn by doing, which is usually the best approach to learning anything. In that light, we will speak a little about each of the areas from the Top 10, then take that learning to the next level by attacking vulnerable sites and investigating vulnerable code and configurations.</p>
<p>Note: During the previous workshops we set up our machines to be ready for web penetration testing. Anyone who has done this can continue as such, but if you have not, no problem, we can help you set up the one or two main tools that we will need for that night. That should only take a couple of minutes. If you would like some assistance in getting set-up then we will be there from 18:45 to help. Alternatively, you can contact one of the organisers (Fiona or Darren) in advance and we will let you know what you need.</p>
<p>If you would like to have ZAP installed on your machine you can get it here: ZAP Install. Having a machine isn't a requirement for attending, there will be talks and demos as well as the practical elements.</p>
<p>This month's workshop will be divided into three phases:</p>
<p><strong>1. Top 10 2013 - A5 - Security Misconfiguration</strong></p>
<p><em>Delivered by: Fiona Collins</em></p>
<p>Security misconfiguration can happen at any level of an application stack, including the platform, web server, application server, database, framework, and custom code. Developers and system administrators need to work together to ensure that the entire stack is configured properly. Automated scanners are useful for detecting missing patches, misconfigurations, use of default accounts, unnecessary services, etc., however these should not be relied upon.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A5-Security_Misconfiguration">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A5-Security_Misconfiguration</a></p>
<p><strong>2. Top 10 2013 - A2 - Broken Authentication and Session Management</strong></p>
<p><em>Delivered by: Darren Fitzpatrick</em></p>
<p>Developers frequently build custom authentication and session management schemes, but building these correctly is hard. As a result, these custom schemes frequently have flaws in areas such as logout, password management, timeouts, remember me, secret question, account update, etc. Finding such flaws can sometimes be difficult, as each implementation is unique.</p>

<p><strong>3. Top 10 2013 - A6 - Sensitive Data Exposure</strong></p>
<p><em>Delivered by: Fiona Collins</em></p>
<p>The most common flaw is simply not encrypting sensitive data. When crypto is employed, weak key generation and management, and weak algorithm usage is common, particularly weak password hashing techniques. Browser weaknesses are very common and easy to detect, but hard to exploit on a large scale. External attackers have difficulty detecting server side flaws due to limited access and they are also usually hard to exploit.</p>

<p><strong>4. Practical Hands On Workshop</strong></p>
<p>This section of the night will invoke our learning from the first phase and put it to practical use. We take our testing environment and use it to exploit some of both types of vulnerabilities on a safe, intentionally vulnerable website.</p>
<p>After giving some time for individually attempting to carry out the exploitation, a walk-through of the exploit technique will be given for each of the examples outlined. The OWASP team will be at hand to help with any issues that might arise through this phase.</p>
<p>The practical elements will allow you attack a vulnerable site from a malicious attacker or software tester's perspective. You will leave with not only an understanding of the issues but also having had hands on practice.</p>
<p>Chapter meetings are provided free of charge although OWASP membership is encouraged and besides supporting the organisation, will provide the holder with benefits in other areas such as free/discounted entry to conferences, etc.</p>

<td style="text-align: center;"><p><strong>Detecting and Preventing XSS, the Most Common Web App Security Flaw.</strong></p>
<p>On Thursday, September 10th, we are having the fourth of our free series of workshops based on OWASP's most well known flagship project, the OWASP Top 10 (2013) <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top10">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top10</a>. The goal of these workshops is to learn by doing, which is usually the best approach to learning anything. In that light, we will speak a little about each of the areas from the Top 10, then take that learning to the next level by attacking vulnerable sites and investigating vulnerable code and configurations.</p>
<p>This month our guest speaker, Damilare Fagbemi, will mainly be investigating Cross Site Scripting (XSS) which claims the third highest spot (A3) in the top 10 and will also touch on A10 - Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards.</p>
<p>Damilare is a software engineer and information security professional with expertise in Software Security and Data Analytics. He is a software security engineer in the Partner team at Intel Security Group where is responsible for developing strategies to improve security in the software development process while ensuring that software products built and shipped for Intel Security's partners are secure.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/damilarefagbemi">@damilarefagbemi</a></p>
<p>Note: During the previous workshops we set up our machines to be ready for web penetration testing. Anyone who has done this can continue as such, but if you have not, no problem, we can help you set up the one or two main tools that we will need for that night. That should only take a couple of minutes. If you would like some assistance in getting set-up then we will be there from 18:45 to help. Alternatively, you can contact one of the organisers (Fiona or Darren) in advance and we will let you know what you need.</p>
<p>If you would like to have ZAP installed on your machine you can get it here: ZAP Install. Having a machine isn't a requirement for attending, there will be talks and demos as well as the practical elements.</p>
<p>This month's workshop will be divided into three phases:</p>
<p><strong>1. Top 10 2013 - A3 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</strong></p>
<p>This important vulnerability can result in your application allowing arbitrary code to be run in the unsuspecting browsers of your users, putting those users at risk.</p>
<p>We will discuss how to identify XSS vulnerabilities in your application, highlight the risks associated with injection flaws, provide some mitigation techniques and demonstrate how this all works.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A3-Cross-Site_Scripting_(XSS)">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A3-Cross-Site_Scripting_(XSS)</a></p>
<p><strong>2. Top 10 2013 - A10 - Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards</strong></p>
<p>An open redirect is a parameter which is accepted and used by the application to redirect a user to a URL of their choosing without any validation. This vulnerability is often used to facilitate phishing attacks.</p>
<p>We will discuss how to identify these vulnerabilities in your application, highlight the associated risks , provide some mitigation techniques and demonstrate how this all works.</p>

<p>We will also be having our summer social event, with some free food and beer, after the talks - see below for more details.</p>
<p>This month we will be looking at Injection flaws which are #1 in the top 10. This is the top item as successful exploitation can lead to complete control of your systems by a malicious user.</p>
<p>Note: During the previous workshops we set up our machines.</p>
<p>Anyone who has set up their machines during the last workshop can continue to use that and will have all tools in place, but if you have not, no problem, we can just set up the one or two main tools that we will need for that night. If you would like some assistance in getting set-up then we will be there from 18:45 to help.

<p>This month's workshop will be divided into two phases with a networking event after the talks:</p>
<p><strong>1. Top 10 2013 - A1 - Injection</strong></p>
<p>Fiona Collins</p>
<p>Injection flaws, such as SQL, OS, and LDAP injection occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attacker’s hostile data can trick the interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing data without proper authorization. The result of this being that an attacker can by-pass any application level controls in place and gain full remote control of the application or database server which can in turn be used to access other systems on your network.</p>
<p>We will discuss how to identify injection vulnerabilities in your application, highlight the risks associated with injection flaws, provide some mitigation techniques and demonstrate how this all works.</p>

<p>'''1. Top 10 2013 - A8 - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) '''</p>
<p>Vincent Ryan</p>
<p>A CSRF attack forces a logged-on victim’s browser to send a forged HTTP request, including the victim’s session cookie and any other automatically included authentication information, to a vulnerable web application. This allows the attacker to force the victim’s browser to generate requests the vulnerable application thinks are legitimate requests from the victim.</p>
<p>We will discuss what this issue is, a number of varieties of this issue along with methods for avoiding it in your application code and a demo of how you would examine a defence using burp.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A8-Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A8-Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)</a></p>
<p>'''2. Top 10 2013 - A9 - Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities '''</p>
<p>Darren Fitzpatrick</p>
<p>Components, such as libraries, frameworks, and other software modules, almost always run with full privileges. If a vulnerable component is exploited, such an attack can facilitate serious data loss or server takeover. Applications using components with known vulnerabilities may undermine application defenses and enable a range of possible attacks and impacts.</p>
<p>We will discuss how know vulnerabilities can be identified in a system and used to get access to other systems and data in your network. Mitigation techniques will also be discussed.</p>

<td style="text-align: center;"><p>Thursday 28 May will see the first of our free series of workshops based on OWASP's most well known flagship project, the OWASP Top 10 (2013) <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top10">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top10</a>. The goal of these workshops is to learn by doing, which is usually the best approach to learning anything. In that light, we will speak a little about each of the areas from the Top 10, then take that learning to the next level by attacking vulnerable sites and investigating vulnerable code and configurations.</p>
<p>Note: To get the most out of these workshops, it would be best to bring your own laptop. This should have &gt;1 GB of RAM, &gt;5 GB of free storage and a reasonably fast processor. Failing these laptop requirements we could probably work around it, but this would be best for following the standard approach that will be taken by most.</p>
<p>This month's workshop will be divided into three phases:</p>
<p><strong>1. Setting Up Your Test Environment</strong></p>
<p>To start the night we will define test environments at a high level and then help you to configure VirtualBox with a hacking / penetration testing specific virtual machine, namely Kali Linux. Kali will provide a tailored, pre-configured environment for testing and comes pre-populated with a vast array of tools for all your hacking needs! If you just bring your laptop, we will have the files ready for you to install, or if you are a paranoid security person ;) you can download in advance from here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.kali.org/downloads/">https://www.kali.org/downloads/</a> (32 bit iso)</p>
<p><strong>2. Top 10 2013 - A4 - Insecure Direct Object References</strong></p>
<p>Insecure direct object reference occurs when a web application allows the user to choose the target data for their transaction without correctly restricting to the data to which they should be privy. In a secure configuration, the target data for retrieval would be based on the particular user session, however often the data retrieval decisions are based on parameters which the user can access. E.g. you access your on-line bank account details, but manipulate the incorrectly implemented request to have the application think that you are another user, and return that other user's details.</p>
<p>We will discuss a number of varieties of this issue along with methods for avoiding it in your application code.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A4-Insecure_Direct_Object_References">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A4-Insecure_Direct_Object_References</a></p>
<p><strong>3. Practical Hands On Workshop</strong></p>
<p>This section of the night will invoke our learning from the first two phases and put it to practical use. We take our new testing environment and use it to exploit some direct object reference vulnerabilities on a safe, intentionally vulnerable website.</p>
<p>After giving some time for individually attempting to carry out the exploitation, a walk-through of the exploit technique will be given for each of the examples outlined. The OWASP team will be at hand to help with any issues that might arise through this phase.</p>
<p>Practical elements will cover the following two perspectives so that you leave with not only an understanding of the issues but also having had hands on practice in these areas:</p>
<p>1. Defensive - Seeing vulnerable code / configurations and investigating how the issues could be rectified.</p>
<p>2. Offensive - Attacking vulnerable sites from a malicious attacker or software tester's perspective.</p></td>

<td style="text-align: center;"><p>The next OWASP Cork Chapter meeting is taking place on Monday September 22nd in UCC (WGB G.14) at 7PM.</p>
<p>We would like to treat all attendees to some beer and pizza after the talks in the Woolshed bar (Mardyke - <a href="http://www.woolshedbaa.com/cork/">http://www.woolshedbaa.com/cork/</a>)</p>
<p>Hope to see you there.</p>
<p>There are two talks lined up:</p>
<p>Talk 1: Introduction to OWASP ZAP</p>
<p>Overview of the OWASP ZAP tool.</p>
<p>The Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is an easy to use integrated penetration testing tool for finding vulnerabilities in web applications.</p>
<p>It is designed to be used by people with a wide range of security experience and as such is ideal for developers and functional testers who are new to penetration testing.</p>
<p>ZAP provides automated scanners as well as a set of tools that allow you to find security vulnerabilities manually.</p>
<p>Talk 2: Mark Denihan - OWASP Security Shepherd</p>
<p>The OWASP Security Shepherd project has been designed and implemented with the aim of fostering and improving security awareness among a varied skill set demographic. Shepherd covers the OWASP Top Ten web app risks and has recently been injected with totally new content to cover the OWASP Top Ten Mobile risks as well. Many of these levels include insufficient mitigations and protections to these risks, such as blacklist filters, atrocious encoding schemes, barbaric security mechanisms and poor security configuration. The modules have been crafted to provide not only a challenge for a security novice, but security professionals as well. In this presentation we're going to look at the Shepherd platform itself from both a learning and teaching perspective. Some of Shepherd's lessons and challenges will be demonstrated and we'll also walkthrough how easy it is to stand up a Security Shepherd instance and how it can be tailored to suit any web/mobile app sec teaching environments.</p>

<td style="text-align: center;"><p>The first OWASP Cork Chapter meeting is taking place on Tuesday September 1st upstairs in SoHo bar on Grand Parade. This meeting is a joint event with the CorkSec group (http://www.meetup.com/CorkSec/). We would love if you could stay around after for a chat and some networking.</p>
<p>There are two talks lined up:</p>
<p>Talk 1: Web to Shell by Darren Fitzpatrick</p>
<p>Darren will introduce the concept of getting a shell through a website. This basically means remotely taking over the server on which a web application is installed. After a little theory, he will go about delivering demonstrations of this in action. Demos will include common attack vectors of this type and one recent and quite common ruby on rails specific remote exploit.</p>
<p>Talk 2: How I got into Security by Jack Baylor</p>
<p>In this short talk I'll be covering:</p>
<ul>
<li>my education and previous work experience</li>
<li>what courses I wish I'd covered but didn't</li>
<li>how I got interested initially</li>
<li>how I started researching and networking</li>
<li>how I came about working in Qualcomm</li>
<li>how some others broke into security (through polling others here and through talking to people on LinkedIn etc...),</li>
<li>what courses I intend to take in the next 1, 2 and 5 years</li>
</ul></td>

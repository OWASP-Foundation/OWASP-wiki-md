## Description

Part of OWASP’s main purpose is to “Be the thriving global community
that drives visibility and evolution in the safety and security of the
world’s software”. A key part of that mission is to educate not just the
current generation of developers or information security professionals,
but also the next generation, particularly in the context of the
acknowledged skills shortage in the security sector.

A common problem with many security education programmes (whether cyber
or InfoSec) or even traditional computer science programmes is that they
do not address application security adequately, if at all. In some
regions, attempts have been made to address this deficit.

In the UK for example, ISC2 and the BCS are working on an initiative to
embed security firmly within the Computer Science curriculum, with an
emphasis on secure coding techniques. OWASP, through my involvement,
also champions this initiative.

There is an opportunity for OWASP to pull together its wide-ranging
expertise, projects, and dedicated volunteers to engage in these types
of education programmes and initiatives by developing an educational
strategy for undergraduate and postgraduate students. This could take
the form of an open “Standard” curriculum template which can be adopted
and adapted by diverse educational partners and organisations. Such a
template would also give a useful starting point or reference document
for when we engage with other professional bodies.

### Aims & Objectives

`* What aspects of Application Security knowledge and skills does industry need?`
`* What problems relating to application security does the next generation of graduate software developers, computer scientists and security analysts need to solve?`
`* Establish a core set of learning objectives for BSC/MSc level Application Security curricula`
`* Establish which OWASP Projects are useful to help shape and support curricula in Application Security`
`* Determine a mechanism by which regional/local deliveries of the curriculum could be supported by the OWASP community (for example, OWASP supporters on validation panels, critical friend on module design, guest lectures and training academics).`

### Project Outputs & Roadmap

  - Produce a wider survey of OWASP trainers and educational supporters
    to canvas opinions on a wider range of generic Application Security
    Skills and knowledge which would be required from a curriculum and
    determining suitable learning objectives to be able to produce an
    “open” curriculum for any educational institution or trainer to
    use.

<!-- end list -->

  - A second and larger part of the work is then to map the knowledge,
    skills & learning objectives to OWASP Project materials to help
    deliver quality educational experiences to those study Application
    Security

## Description

A logic bomb is a piece of malicious code that executes when specific
trigger conditions are met. A typical example would be a program that
monitors a company's payroll system, and attacks the company if a
specific employee is terminated. A time bomb is a type of logic bomb
that uses a date and time as its trigger condition. They are
differentiated from software "easter eggs" by their malicious nature.

## Risk Factors

A logic bomb can affect any systems that were accessible to the
attacker. Depending on the motivation of the attacker, the bomb itself
could modify payroll systems, steal corporate databases, or crash
critical infrastructure.

  - [Computer Viruses](Computer_Viruses "wikilink") occasionally use
    logic bombs as their payloads. This allows the virus time to spread
    before alerting infected users with its attack.
  - [Internal developers](internal_software_developer "wikilink") or [IT
    contractors](Contractors "wikilink") are the typical threat agents
    capable of delivering logic bombs.

## Examples

### Medco Health Solutions

  -
    A unix systems administrator recieved 30 months in federal prison
    for inserting a logic bomb in Medco Health Solutions servers.

    An IT contractor for Fannie Mae inserted a time bomb to attack
    corporate servers.

### Siberian Pipeline Sabotage

  -
    It is alleged (and disputed) that a 1982 explosion of a Soviet
    natural gas pipeline was caused by a logic bomb.

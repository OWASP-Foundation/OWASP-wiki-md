## Description

A category of attacks in which an attacker compromises a single state of
the PRNG and penetrates past or future outputs of the PRNG using this
information [1](http://www.schneier.com/paper-prngs.pdf). Usually this
attack is executed using the seed state or a vulnerable state in which
insufficient entropy is available.

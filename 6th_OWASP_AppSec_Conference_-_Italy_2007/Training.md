## Conference Training Day - One Day Training Courses - May 15th, 2007

OWASP has arranged to have three one day Application Security training
courses the day prior to the conference.

The first course will be provided by a long time contributor to OWASP,
Aspect Security. The second course will be provided by another active
OWASP member, the Arctec Group. Both of these courses were offered at
both OWASP AppSec 2006 conferences and were well received. The third
course is being taught by Dinis Cruz, the OWASP Evangelist and one of
the longest active members at OWASP. This course was also taught at the
OWASP AppSec Seattle 2006 conference. These courses are being offered to
attendees of the OWASP conference at a significant discount to their
standard commercial price. Most of the course fee will go to OWASP to
support the OWASP Foundation's efforts.

## T1. Foundations of Web Application Security - One Day Course - May 15th, 2007

**Course Overview**

Most developers, IT professionals, and auditors learn what they know
about application security on the job, usually by making mistakes.
Application security is just not a part of many computer science
curricula today and most organizations have not focused on instituting a
culture that includes application security as a core part of their IT
security efforts.

This powerful one day course focuses on the most common web application
security problems, including the OWASP Top Ten. The course will
introduce and demonstrate hacking techniques, illustrating how
application vulnerabilities can be exploited so students really
understand how to avoid introducing such vulnerabilities into their
code.

**Details**

This course starts with a module designed to raise awareness of just how
insecure most web applications are. We demonstrate how easily hackers
are able to attack web applications, and what some of the most common
and most significant vulnerabilities are. The course then provides an
overview of how web applications work from a security perspective.

The next modules detail a number of specific security areas. We describe
common vulnerabilities, present best practices, and discuss recommended
approaches for avoiding such vulnerabilities. This course includes
coverage of the following common vulnerability areas:

  - Unvalidated Parameters \*
  - Broken Access Control \*
  - Broken Account and Session Management \*
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Flaws \*
  - Buffer Overflows \*
  - Command Injection Flaws \*
  - Error Handling Problems \*
  - Insecure Use of Cryptography \*
  - Denial of Service \*
  - Web and Application Server Misconfiguration \*
  - Poor Logging Practices
  - Caching, Pooling, and Reuse Errors
  - Code Quality

\* The OWASP Top Ten Most Critical Web Application Vulnerabilities

For each area, the course covers the following:

  - Theoretical foundations
  - Recommended security policies
  - Common pitfalls when implementing
  - Details on historical exploits
  - Best practices for implementation

**Hands on Exercises**

To cement the principles delivered via the lecture portion of the
course, students can participate in a number of hands-on security
testing exercises. During the hands-on exercises students will attack a
live web application (i.e., WebGoat) that has been seeded with common
web application vulnerabilities. The students will use proxy tools
commonly used by the hacker community to complete the exercises.

**Requirements**

If you are interested in participating in the hands on portion of the
course, please bring a Windows based laptop that supports Java.

## T2. Web Services and XML Security - One Day Course - May 15th, 2007

**Course Overview**

The movement towards Web Services and Service Oriented architecture
(SOA) paradigms requires new security paradigms to deal with new risks
posed by these architectures. This session takes a pragmatic approach
towards identifying Web Services security risks and selecting and
applying countermeasures to the application, code, web servers,
databases, application, and identity servers and related software.

Many enterprises are currently developing new Web Services and/or adding
and acquiring Web Services functionality into existing applications --
now is the time to build security into the system\!

**Details**

Topics covered include understanding how web application risks (such as
those in OWASP Guide and OWASP Top Ten) apply in a Web Services world,
and Web Services security topics including:

  - Web Services attack patterns
  - Common XML attack patterns
  - Data and XML security using WS-Security, SAML, XML Encryption and
    XML Digital Signature
  - Identity services and federation with SAML and Liberty
  - Hardening Web Services servers
  - Input validation for Web Services
  - Integrating Web Services securely with backend resources and
    applications using WS-Trust
  - Secure Exception handling in Web Services

## T3. Advanced ASP.NET Exploits and Countermeasures - One Day Course - May 15th, 2007

**Course Overview**

In this one day course you will push ASP.NET to the limit and will be
shown how ASP.NET applications and environments can be exploited by
skilled attackers. Advanced exploitation techniques will be presented
together with low-level technical analysis of the .NET Framework. You
will also learn advanced defense techniques such as: Building an ASP.NET
Security Protection layer (also called a Web Application Firewall) and
Real time patching of vulnerabilities in the target application, the
.NET Framework or the CLR.

**Details**

The Course is made of 2 modules (one in the morning and one in the
afternoon)

**Module 1: Security principles and .NET Framework Architecture;
Guerrilla Threat Modeling; Exploiting ASP.NET Applications**

  - Analysis of the .NET Framework and its core components (CLR, Garbage
    Collector, Verifier, Security Manager)
  - Using quick-and-dirty threat models to discover vulnerabilities in
    the target application
  - Exploiting vulnerabilities in ASP.NET applications: Data Validation,
    Authorization, Authentication, SessionState, XSS, Cookies, AJAX, Web
    Services, Remoting, etc. (using basic and advanced techniques)
  - Exploiting Buffer Overflows and Windows vulnerabilities via ASP.NET
    Applications

**Module 2: Exploiting Full Trust and Partial Trust ASP.NET
Environments; Advanced ASP.NET Countermeasures**

  - Practical demonstrations of the power of Full Trust ASP.NET:
  - Rooting the CLR (e.g. patching the .Net Framework and CLR),
    Reflection, IIS Metabase, Shellcode injection, Launching internal
    attacks to compromise the server and the data center
  - Full Trust non-verification and Type Safety attacks (via MSIL
    manipulation)
  - Exploiting Insecure Partial Trust ASP.NET Environments
  - Applying real-time security patches in the target application, .NET
    Framework and CLR
  - Solutions to create secure Data Validation and Authorization
    architectures
  - Creating secure ASP.NET hosting environments
  - Building an ASP.NET Security Protection layer (also called Web
    Application Firewall);

You will walk away from this class with a much better understanding of
some of the weaknesses of .NET applications, particularly the internals
of the .NET framework. You will also get the chance to put your skills
to the test against a target application over the course of the class.

**Requirements**

A laptop with VMWare Player pre-installed. A VMWare image containing all
necessary lab tools will be provided.

**Prerequisites**

This is an advanced course targeted at industry professionals who want
to understand the weaknesses and the power of the .Net Framework.

To get the most of this course and to be able to do the extensive
practice material provided (using a VMWare image), the participants
must:

  - Have a good understanding of a .NET Language (Ideally C\#)
  - Be familiar with MSIL/Assembly
  - Have some experience with debugging user-land applications
  - Have commercial experience on either application development or
    security auditing.

The material is presented at a pace adjusted for experienced developers
and/or security consultants.

**Trainer**

Dinis Cruz is the OWASP Evangelist, current OWASP .NET Project leader
and the main developer of several of OWASP .NET tools (SAM'SHE, ANBS,
SiteGenerator, PenTest Reporter, Asp.Net Reflector, Online IIS Metabase
Explorer).

Since the 1.1 release of the .NET Framework, Dinis has been one of the
strongest proponents of the need to write .NET applications that can be
executed in secure Partially Trusted .NET environments, and has done
extensive research on: Rooting the CLR, exposing the dangers of Full
Trust ASP.NET Code, Type Confusion vulnerabilities in Full Trust (i.e.
non verifiable) code, creating .Net Security Protection Layers and using
Reflection to dynamically manipulate .Net Client applications.

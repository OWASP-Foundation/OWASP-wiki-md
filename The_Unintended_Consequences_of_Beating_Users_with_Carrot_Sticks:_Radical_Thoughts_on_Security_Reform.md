![Tomhave.jpg](Tomhave.jpg "Tomhave.jpg")What we're doing today is not
working and isn't sustainable. The fundamental culture of the average
business does not encourage making good security decisions. Software
shops continue to focus on functionality and timelines, neglecting
information security. In spite of regulations like PCI and HIPAA+HITECH,
which are levying fines against organizations for their security
failures, the tipping point has clearly not been reached to cause
meaningful change. Much of this problem can be attributed to the
excessive use of negative incentives (sticks) instead of providing
positive incentives (carrots) that inspire better decision making and
motivate true change. Fortunately, it's not too late to change tactics
and start achieving demonstrable success.

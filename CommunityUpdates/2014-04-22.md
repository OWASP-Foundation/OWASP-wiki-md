  - [OWASP Portal](https://myowasp.force.com/) is now live and community
    in beta
      - We now are using the portal for all membership and event
        registrations (there are also public links (similar to guest
        checkout) to both so logging into the portal isn't required to
        purchase or attend. The portal is a central place to manage
        contact information, preferences such as chapter allocation,
        membership, event registration and coming soon donations.
      - Questios? See <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Portal> - Page is
        a work in progress, but it should outline where to go to log in
        as well as FAQs.
      - "Community portal" also added an item in the left hand
        navigation menu on the wiki
      - Any and all comments are appreciated - the community
        functionality is obviously in beta and we will need to decide
        whether to leave that feature "turned on".

<!-- end list -->

        related, Hugo can help them and we will bill the according
        (chapter/project/conference budget). If community members have

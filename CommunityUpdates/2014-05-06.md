# Notable Project Activity

## New Activity

  - [OWASP Media
    Project](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project) - Want
    to broadcast to the world or your chapter? This project has all the
    resources and info to get you moving. See the list of items already
    on the [OWASP Global Youtube
    Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/OWASPGLOBAL) and instructions
    [here](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Media_Project#tab=Help)
      - Did you also knew that these subscribers would have received
        notice of the live event when they go to YouTube, thus giving
        you more view? Same goes for the recorded version.
      - Did you know that we can easily feature it on owasp.org front
        page using the channel?
      - And more importantly, did you knew that using OWASP official
        channel is the same as having your own channel, only that you
        have to switch account to page in Google? The only difference it
        would make is the name next to the video, it would be "OWASP".

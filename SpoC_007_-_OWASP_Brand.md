## Paulo Coimbra - OWASP Brand

### Executive Summary

I propose to give a contribution to the OWASP Branding Project, by
working on the following issues:

1\. Accordingly to the established rules now in place for the
utilization of the OWASP Brand, I intend:

  - To identify the users of the Brand and their pattern of utilization;
  - To identify cases where misusing occurs: which rules are mostly
    broken and what processes are used to break them;
  - To create a typified profile of inadequate utilization of the OWASP
    Brand;

2\. Based on the previous survey, I intend:

  - To contribute for the enhancement and stabilization of a political
    and economical concept for the Brand and for what it represents in
    terms of market positioning;
  - Having as a base the Brandâ€™s enhanced concept, to establish a set of
    rules whereby the circumstances of use of the Brand are objectively
    controlled and measured.

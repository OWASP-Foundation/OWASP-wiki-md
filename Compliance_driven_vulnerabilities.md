## The presentation

Fingerprinting and enumeration techniques help plan security
assessments, but knowledge of the compliance requirements can also
provide an insight into the application. If the compliance requirements
are fully considered at earlier stages in the software development
lifecycle, the implications for security can be addressed reducing
design changes later on. These topics are explored with reference to
legislative, regulatory and other mandates including the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 which covers a wide range of
recommendations for making Web content more accessible.

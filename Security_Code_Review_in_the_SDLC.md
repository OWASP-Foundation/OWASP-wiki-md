Security code reviews vary widely in their level of formality. Reviews
can be as informal as inviting a friend to help look for a hard-to-find
vulnerability, and they can be as formal as a software inspection
process with trained teams, assigned roles and responsibilities, and a
formal metric and quality tracking program.

In *Peer Reviews in Software,* Karl Wiegers lists seven review processes
from least to most formal:

1.  Ad hoc review
2.  Passaround
3.  Pair programming
4.  Walkthrough
5.  Team review
6.  Inspection

Throughout the SDLC there are points at which an application security
consultant should get involved. Performing security activities across
the lifecycle has proven to be far more cost-effective than either a
“big design up front” security effort or a single pre-production
security review. The reason for intervening at regular intervals is that
potential issues can be detected early on in the development life cycle
where they are less costly to address.

Integration of security code review into the System Development Life
Cycle (SDLC) can yield dramatic results to the overall quality of the
code developed. Security code review is not a silver bullet, but is part
of a healthy application development diet. Consider it as one of the
layers in a defense-in-depth approach to application security. Security
code review is also a cornerstone of the approach to developing secure
software. The idea of integrating a phase into your SLDC may sound
daunting, yet another layer of complexity or an additional cost, but in
the long term and in today's cyber landscape it is cost effective,
reputation building, and in the best interest of any business to do so.

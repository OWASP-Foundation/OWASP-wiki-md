The goals of March/April included:

  - Publishing the Open Letter to Browsers
  - Finish and publish the Web Application Framework Security Matrix
  - Begin work on Struts2 security gap analysis

The framework security matrix has not been released due to increased
contact with vendors looking to make sure the information in the
document is accurate. Because of the utmost desire for accuracy, we will
continue to delay as long as useful updates come in from vendors within
reason. The Open Letter to Browsers is still being reviewed by committee
and the document is becoming outdated and will almost definitely need to
be scrapped without re-testing. The draft of the Struts2 security gap
analysis has been sent to the OWASP Leaders list and we are awaiting
feedback.

The goals of May-June include:

  - Publish the Web Application Framework Security Matrix
  - Publish the Struts2 security gap analysis
  - Continue outreach with Adobe, Spring, Sun, and Struts2 team

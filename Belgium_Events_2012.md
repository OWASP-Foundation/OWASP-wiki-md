### PROGRAM

The agenda:

  - 18h00 - 18h30: *Welcome*
  - 18h30 - 19h30: **Introducing the Smartphone Penetration Testing
    Framework** (by Georgia Weidman, Bulb Security LLC)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    As smartphones enter the workplace, sharing the network and
    accessing sensitive data, it is crucial to be able to assess the
    security posture of these devices in much the same way we perform
    penetration tests on workstations and servers. However, smartphones
    have unique attack vectors that are not currently covered by
    available industry tools. The smartphone penetration testing
    framework, the result of a DARPA Cyber Fast Track project, aims to
    provide an open source toolkit that addresses the many facets of
    assessing the security posture of these devices. We will look at the
    functionality of the framework including information gathering,
    exploitation, social engineering, and post exploitation through both
    a traditional IP network and through the mobile modem, showing how
    this framework can be leveraged by security teams and penetration
    testers to gain an understanding of the security posture of the
    smartphones in an organization. We will also show how to use the
    framework through a command line console, a graphical user
    interface, and a smartphone based app. Demonstrations of the
    framework assessing multiple smartphone platforms will be shown.
    Georgia Weidman is a penetration tester, security researcher, and
    trainer. She holds a Master of Science degree in computer science,
    secure software engineering, and information security as well as
    holding CISSP, CEH, NIST 4011, and OSCP certifications. Her work in
    the field of smartphone exploitation has been featured in print and
    on television internationally. She has presented her research at
    conferences around the world including Shmoocon, Hacker Halted,
    Security Zone, and Bsides. Georgia has delivered highly technical
    security training for conferences, schools, and corporate clients to
    excellent reviews. Building on her experience, Georgia recently
    founded Bulb Security LLC a security consulting firm specializing in
    security assessments/penetration testing, security training, and
    research/development. She was awarded a DARPA Cyber Fast Track grant
    to continue her work in mobile device security.

  - 19h00 - 19h15: **OWASP Update** (by Sebastien Deleersnyder, SAIT
    Zenitel, OWASP Board)
  - 19h15 - 20h00: **You Are What You Include: Remote JavaScript
    Inclusions** (by Steven Van Acker, DistriNet, KU Leuven)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    JavaScript is used by web developers to enhance the interactivity of
    their sites, offload work to the users' browsers and improve their
    sites' responsiveness and user-friendliness, making web pages feel
    and behave like traditional desktop applications. An important
    feature of JavaScript, is the ability to combine multiple libraries
    from local and remote sources into the same page, under the same
    namespace. While this enables the creation of more advanced web
    applications, it also allows for a malicious JavaScript provider to
    steal data from other scripts and from the page itself. Today, when
    developers include remote JavaScript libraries, they trust that the
    remote providers will not abuse the power bestowed upon them.
    In this talk, we report on a large-scale crawl of more than three
    million pages of the top 10,000 Alexa sites, and identify the trust
    relationships of these sites with their library providers. We also
    identify four, previously unknown, types of vulnerabilities that
    attackers could use to attack popular web sites. Lastly, we review
    some proposed ways of protecting a web application from malicious
    remote scripts and show that some of them may not be as effective as
    previously thought.
    **Steven Van Acker** is PhD student at DistriNet (KU Leuven). As web
    application security researcher, he studies among others secure
    containment solutions for untrusted JavaScript, and conducts large
    scale security assessments across the Internet. He also actively
    creates and maintains wargames at OverTheWire.org and
    HackitoErgoSum.org CTFs.

  - 20h00 - 20h15: Break
  - 20h15 - 21h00: **Modern Information Gathering** (by Dave van Stein,
    KZA bv)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    Nowadays sharing information is becoming normal and hackers use this
    to their advantage. This talk will try to provide insight in the
    amount of information that anonymous attackers can retrieve about
    your systems (and users) by showing some of the possibilities of
    tools freely available.
    **Dave van Stein** is a security consultant at KZA bv. He has more
    than 11 years of experience in software and acceptance testing and
    started specializing in Web Application Security in the beginning of
    2008. Over the years Dave has gained experience with many open
    source and commercial testing tools. Dave is active in the Dutch
    OWASP chapter and he is both ISEB/ISTQB-certified and EC-Council
    'Certified Ethical Hacker'.

  - 20h15 - 21h15: **Access Control Design Best Practices
    ([PPT](https://www.owasp.org/images/8/84/Be_chapter_presentation_by_jim_manico_Access_Control_Pitfalls_v1.1.pptx))**
    (by Jim Manico, WhiteHat Security)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    Access Control is a necessary security control at almost every layer
    within a web application. This talk will discuss several of the key
    access control anti-patterns commonly found during website security
    audits. These access control anti-patterns include hard-coded
    security policies, lack of horizontal access control, and "fail
    open" access control mechanisms. In reviewing these and other access
    control problems, we will discuss and design a positive access
    control mechanism that is data contextual, activity based,
    configurable, flexible, and deny-by-default - among other positive
    design attributes that make up a robust web-based access-control
    mechanism.
    **Jim Manico** is the VP of Security Architecture for WhiteHat
    Security, a web security firm. Jim is a participant and project
    manager of the OWASP Developer Cheatsheet series. He is also the
    producer and host of the OWASP Podcast Series.

    (by Kris Buytaert, Inuits)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    This talk will summarize the different ideas behind devops, and will
    show that this goes beyond tooling and becomes a way of thinking,
    where ultimately everybody will stand together to support the
    business.
    Some call this phenomenon devops, others hate the word and want to
    call it \*ops or ops\* , truth is that agile techniques used in
    development have an impact on the way operations organizes it work.
    Similar, operations and sysadmins are becoming programmers because
    of the virtualization and automation trend where everything is
    managed through an API. And security is imvolved everywhere.
    **[Kris Buytaert](http://www.krisbuytaert.be/bio.shtml)** is a long
    time Linux and Open Source Consultant. He's one of instigators of
    the devops movement, currently working for Inuits. Kris is the

    frequently speaking at, or organizing different international
    conferences. He spends most of his time working on Linux Clustering
    (both High Availability, Scalability and HPC), Virtualisation and
    Large Infrastructure Management projects hence trying to build
    infrastructures that can survive the 10th floor test, better known

    ([ppt](https://www.owasp.org/images/6/62/OWASP_Presentation_January2012_Erwin_Geirnaert.ppt))**
    (by Erwin Geirnaert, Zion Security)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    During this presentation we give an overview of how we can harden
    web applications against different types of attacks used by malware
    to bypass the existing security controls in the web application. We
    discuss the OWASP Top 10 and how malware can abuse these attacks and
    how the developer must implement a different strategy. We explain
    why (mobile) browser security is an important aspect of web
    application hardening and most importantly that the battle against
    malware is an ongoing battle. For every countermeasure the security
    industry develops to protect web applications and is used by a lot
    of companies today we will show how malware is being developed to
    bypass these solutions. To finalize we give some advice on how to
    protect against these malware attacks, using pro-active and
    detective controls.

Some thoughts and the things I would like to do/achieve in the GCC:

I have been a passive member as part of the Belgian OWASP chapter since
2007 and picked up the role of chapter leader in Japan end of 2011 after
encouragement of some other OWASP leaders. I'm a founding member and was
co-organizer of the not-for-profit BruCON conference which was well
received and today with 400+ attendees has a fairly good and positive
reputation in the community. I believe I can leverage this experience
and advise other people organizing any OWASP conference and event. I
want to especially focus on supporting events in the APAC region as well
as within Japan. I want to improve collaboration between the different
chapters and organizers.

Please be aware that for an application to be considered by the board,
**you MUST have 5 recommendations**. An incomplete application will not
be considered for vote.

We are pleased to announce that this year we will be adding on two
different training classes the day before the Lonestar Application

LASCON, you will have the ability to add the training of your choice on
the "Agenda" screen of registration. The trainings are as follows:
**<u>TRAINING 1 ($250):</u>**
**Title: Advanced Threat Tactics with Armitage and Metasploit**
Metasploit is a powerful exploit framework and a must-have tool for
penetration testers. Armitage builds a workflow on top of the Metasploit
framework and exposes its most advanced capabilities. This demonstration
and lab oriented session will teach you Metasploit and Armitage for the
purpose of emulating adversary tactics. This course will start with the
basics and quickly take you into the workflow of modern threats. You'll
learn how to create trojan files, manage covert HTTP and HTTPS
communications, set up social engineering attacks, and use pivoting to
take over a network.
To participate in the labs, you must have VMWare Player, VMWare Fusion,
or VMWare Workstation installed.
Raphael has put up some additional information on this class on his
website at <http://www.fastandeasyhacking.com/threats>.

Previously, Raphael worked as a security researcher, software engineer,
penetration tester, and system administrator.
**<u>TRAINING 2 ($250):</u>**
**Title: Bootstrapping Your Application Security Program**
This training class is for new managers & leads accountable for
integrating Application Security into their enterprise. The course will
walk through various success factors, including a mixture of strategy,
policy, and technology considerations. The course will help attendees
develop incremental plans they can employ to make both short-term and

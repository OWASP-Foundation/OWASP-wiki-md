### CISO Guide project

    the draft finished in good working order for November of 2012
  - there is approved funding for socialising the CISO Guide in the
    range of USD5000 for presenting etc from the "project reboot"
  - Tobias will assist in writing some chapters based on the CISO
    training workshops he gives at the AppSecs

### CISO Survey

  - there is still some uncertainty around the execution of the CISO
    Survey.
      - how do we get a sufficient number and quality of feedback
        submissions of CISO/CISO-like people
      - how to analyse the data + build a report
      - some ideas is to collect answers at AppSec meetings and
        integrate the results into the CISO Guide
  - what questions did we use before (Rex will send round the previous
    survey questions and question categories)

### Plans for AppSec EU and other AppSecs

  - there was some good experience with an "industry table" at the
    AppSec APAC 2012 in Sydney (by Tobias).
  - we should consider repeating this initiative at other AppSec
    conferences
  - AppSec EU: Colin will organise the industry (e.g. "Industry Leader")
    table / dinner / evening for AppSec EU

**Remo presentation (Positive ModSecurity rulesets / Input validation)**

The most widespread approach to rulesets for ModSecurity and Web
Application Firewall in general is to use negative rulesets. That is to
defend against patterns of known attacks.

Such a "default permit" strategy is inadequate for network firewalls and
it will also be inadequate for application layer defense in the long
run.

[Remo](http://remo.netnea.com) is a simple rule editor, that writes
ModSecurity rules which in turn can be used inside a WAF running
ModSecurity.

The speech will introduce black- and whitelist approaches and give a
brief overview on Remo and the status of the project.

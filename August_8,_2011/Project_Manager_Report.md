    led by Psiinon

##### Projects Mailing List

  - Jason Li populated the owasp-projects mailing list with all known
    projects leaders so the Projects Committee could easily send
    announcements regarding OWASP projects news. I have supported this
    activity by gathering all email addresses and filling in projects
    inventory spreadsheet. By GPC decision, the list is
    owasp-projects@lists.owasp.org and it is announce-only by the GPC
    committee members (similar to how OWASP-all is announce-only by
    Board/staff members) and should be reserved for project
    announcements only.

##### OWASP Newsletter

  - I've prepared GPC's data for the next issue of the OWASP Newsletter.

##### Routine Tasks

  - My daily routine always includes answering a relatively wide range
    of questions regularly posed by OWASP members and mainly by OWASP
    Projects leaders; I receive such inquiries either directly or
    through the [OWASP Website Global Feedback & Inquiry
    Form](https://spreadsheets0.google.com/a/owasp.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AhtB029bdcxGdFN1R2NIMTNROXN3dml4ZEcxXzJQYXc#gid=0).
    The variety of matters that I currently deal with can be checked in
    my email tool and the tree of folders built to store, follow up and
    organize them as follows
    [1](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/13817486/Screen%20Shots%20copy/1_Screen%20shot.png),[2](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/13817486/Screen%20Shots%20copy/2_Screen%20shot.png),[3](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/13817486/Screen%20Shots%20copy/3_Screen%20shot.png),[4](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/13817486/Screen%20Shots%20copy/4_Screen%20shot.png),[5](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/13817486/Screen%20Shots%20copy/5_Screen%20shot.png),[6](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/13817486/Screen%20Shots%20copy/6_Screen%20shot.png),[7](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/13817486/Screen%20Shots%20copy/7_Screen%20shot.png),[8](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/13817486/Screen%20Shots%20copy/8_Screen%20shot.png),[9](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/13817486/Screen%20Shots%20copy/9_Screen%20shot.png).
    I would like to note that to perform this task, and all the others
    projects' related ones, I have always had relevant support and
    guidance from the OWASP Global Projects Committee.
  - I've kept all [OWASP Projects Dashboard
    2.0](OWASP_Projects_Dashboard_2.0 "wikilink")'s databases up-to-date
    as follows:
      - [OWASP Reviews Dashboard](OWASP_Reviews_Dashboard "wikilink"),
      - [OWASP Project Reviewers
        Database](OWASP_Project_Reviewers_Database "wikilink"),
      - [Projects 2.0/By Set Up Date
        Order](OWASP_Projects_Dashboard_2.0/By_Set_Up_Order "wikilink"),
      - [Projects 2.0/By Alphabetic
        Order](OWASP_Projects_Dashboard_2.0/By_Alphabetical_Order "wikilink"),
      - [OWASP Training](OWASP_Training "wikilink"),
      - [OWASP Project
        Inventory](https://spreadsheets0.google.com/a/owasp.org/spreadsheet/ccc?pli=1&key=tF9r45eprbpdY6xuSbwEuMw#gid=0).

#### Proposal of future activity

  - To continue answering all received projects' related questions.
  - To continue setting up new projects and new releases as requested.
  - To continue spreading the [GPC
    templates](:Category:GPC_Templates "wikilink") through all OWASP
    projects.
  - To implement all GPC requests and concretely to support its plans
    to:
      - Carry out the Project Hosting initiative as a tool to provide a
        centralized repository for OWASP;
      - Build a new OWASP Projects Portal;
      - Design the second leg of the assessment criteria 2.0, i.e., its
        Project Health component.
  - As soon as the above referred assessment's second leg is designed
    and approved, to begin a process to evaluate as much Projects as
    possible.
  - To set up all the [OWASP free training
    courses](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Training#tab=Initiatives)
    that may be requested by OWASP Chapters.
  - To work with Dinis Cruz, Carlos Serrão and Konstantinos
    Papapanagiotou to produce an initial/draft proposal of an OWASP
    Training Academy.

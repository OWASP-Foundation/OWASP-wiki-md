This category should be used to mark articles about application security
activities.

## What is an application security activity?

Application security activities are key practices that are performed
during the software development lifecycle in order to reduce risk or
increase assurance in an application. Note that these are just
independent steps, and that they may be integrated into a number of
different software development approaches.

Given that these activities must support many different development
lifecycles, they should not be too tightly coupled. To the extent
possible, they should be written to augment common software development
practices. Differences applying the activity in different lifecycles
should be noted.

## Examples of application security activities

For an overview, please see the [OWASP CLASP
Project](OWASP_CLASP_Project "wikilink"), which is focused on developing
and enhancing application security activities.

Each article about an activity should document the following:

  - the name of the activity
  - the goal or expected outcome of the activity
  - when in the overall software development lifecycle the activity is
    typically performed
  - dependencies with other activities
  - the inputs required to perform the activity
  - the deliverables from the activity
  - the skills and tools necessary to perform the activity
  - the set of steps that comprise the activity
  - notes on applying the activity in common software development
    processes

The [OWASP CLASP Project](OWASP_CLASP_Project "wikilink") is focused on
developing and enhancing these activities. Check there to look for tasks
or see if your idea is already part of our plan.

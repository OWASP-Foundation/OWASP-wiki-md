## Interview with Jeff Williams (OWASP Podcast 67)

Jim Manico

  -
    You are listening to the Open Web Application Security Project. This
    is an OWASP Top Ten 2010 podcast. We have with us today Jeff
    Williams. Jeff Williams is the CEO of Aspect Security. He is the
    volunteer chair of the OWASP Foundation, and he is also the primary
    author of the OWASP XSS Cheat Sheet. So Jeff, can you start by
    telling us what you think about the many changes in the OWASP Top
    Ten for 2010?

Jeff Williams

  -
    Well, let’s see. Technically the changes aren’t that significant.
    There is only a couple of real new areas in the Top Ten. Security
    misconfiguration, which we used to have in the Top Ten a long time
    ago, but we took it out and now it is back in because based on our
    new model, which I will talk about in a second, it deserved to be
    back in, and the other thing that we added in was invalidated
    redirects and forwards, and that has been a problem for awhile out
    there. We see it quite a bit, but with the rise of malware as one of
    the massive threats to people using the Internet, we felt this one
    really deserved to be one of the Top Ten, and the data supports it,
    so we added it in there. Now the big change to this year is that in
    previous years we called it the Top Ten Vulnerabilities, and that
    was fine. It did a lot of good in helping get aware of the
    vulnerabilities they should be protecting against, but we feel like
    the market has moved past that a little bit, and in some cases they
    were more interested in really understanding the risk associated
    with some of these bad programming practices, and so we have changed
    the OWASP Top Ten. It is now the OWASP Top Ten Application Security
    Risks, and we focus on not just the vulnerability, but also sort of
    the whole chain of the threat, from the threat agent who might
    attack something to the attack vector they might use to the security
    weakness, which is what we used to call the vulnerability, we talk
    about the security controls, and then we talk about the impact a
    little bit, like the technical impact of a problem and the business
    impact of the problem, and by putting that whole chain together,
    we’re hoping that people get an even better understanding of what
    this problem means to their business, and hopefully that will drive
    more people to fix these things instead of continuing to sort of
    ignore them.

Jim Manico

  -
    Jeff, the OWASP Top Ten team is on track to create a cheat sheet for
    every OWASP Top Ten category. You’re the author of the first one,
    the XSS, the cross-site scripting prevention cheat sheet. Jeff, why
    do we even need this cheat sheet? You only authored this last year
    but there is nothing else out there that provides this level of
    defensive description. Why do you think that is? Why do we need
    this?

Jeff Williams

  -
    Well, let’s see. There has been a huge amount of study into XSS
    attacks, so you’ve got…cheat sheet, on all the ways, all the
    different XSS attack vectors, there are tools that scan for XSS.
    There has been this ton of research on the attack side, and
    basically, until I tried to put together this sheet, the guidance
    for developers was really pretty thin. Even at OWASP and in the
    previous versions of the Top Ten, the guidance has basically been do
    the HTML into the encoding on your untrusted input and then you’re
    fine. That guidance wasn’t good enough. It’s not good enough to stop
    a large number of XSS attacks, and it really represented, I think, a
    fairly poor understanding of the problem for developers and it makes
    us look like we don’t know what we’re talking about. It makes us
    look irrelevant, so I try to put this together to explain how XSS
    works a little better from the programmer’s perspective and really
    what they have to do and the underlying theme of the OWASP Top Ten
    Prevention Cheat Sheet is that you have to encode based on the
    context that you are putting untrusted data into, so there is
    different rules. If you’re putting untrusted data into regular,
    standard HTML, you can use HTML into the escaping and there is
    different rules there, but if you’re putting it into an attribute or
    into JavaScript or into CSS or into a URL you need to use different
    escaping formats, I mean completely different. Like instead of using
    ampersand-LT-semicolon, you need to use percent-two-F, and you need
    to, if it’s a URL, if you’re in CSS you need to use backslash-27. If
    you need to use a JavaScript segment, then you need to use
    backslash-X, so different rules for different places in the HTML
    document.

Jim Manico

  -
    Let’s talk about untrusted data for a moment. What is your vision of
    what untrusted data really is? Is that just data that we get from
    the browser from a user, or is there more?

Jeff Williams

  -
    Well, certainly a lot of untrusted data does come from the browser,
    and hopefully developers are treating everything that comes from the
    browser in the HTTP request as untrusted data, but I don’t think we
    should stop there. There is a lot of different types of untrusted
    data. If you are using back-end services, like you’ve got a database
    or you’re connecting to a web service or you’re pulling data out of
    documents, you have to consider where all that data came from and
    what you should do is think, am I guaranteed that this data doesn’t
    have scripts in it, and if you can’t guarantee that then you really
    should follow the simple rules in the prevention cheat sheet.

Jim Manico

  -
    So Jeff, would you care to tell us how you think input validation
    relates to cross-site scripting? To this day, when you go Google
    around and look for information on XSS defense, more often than not,
    folks say that XSS can be solved at the boundary through input
    validation routines. What do you think of that, Jeff?

Jeff Williams

  -
    Well, I mean, the straight up fact is that input validation can’t
    prevent all XSS. There are lots of situations where you need the
    characters that can be used to cause cross-site scripting problems
    in your application, so you might need less-thans and semicolons and
    single-ticks and those sorts of characters. You might need those in
    your input, so straight input validation really shouldn’t be used to
    provide complete protection against XSS. Now that said, I am a huge
    advocate of input validation. I have talked about it several times
    at conferences. It is very important, and so I think of it as an
    important defense in depth-factor, but it’s really not the perfect
    way to eliminate all cross-site scripting from the organization.

Jim Manico

  -
    So Jeff, before we go too deep into defensive theory, can we talk a
    little bit about injection attack theory? Would you care to tell us
    about injecting up and injecting down and how that relates to XSS?

Jeff Williams

  -
    When I started looking at cross-site scripting and trying to put
    this cheat sheet together, I came up with some theory about how this
    kind of injection really works, and cross-site scripting really is
    just a kind of injection. Now when I say injection, I mean something
    kind of specific. I mean that the attacker’s data is breaking out of
    the data context and entering a code context. Typically, that is
    used, they do that through the use of some special characters that
    are significant in whatever interpreter happens to be interpreting
    that data, so in HTML, those are interpreters like the HTML parser
    or the XML parser that underlies that, the CSS parser, the
    JavaScript parser, the URL parser all have different special
    characters that are relevant in those contexts, and what I noticed
    was that there is a couple of different types of injection within
    XSS that are happening here, so frequently what happens is that you
    are closing the data context and you are starting a new code
    context, so this is what happens when like if you are injecting into
    an attribute value, you are going to close that attribute with a
    quote. You might close the whole HTML element with a greater-than or
    a backslash-greater-than and then you are going to start a new
    context where you might put in a script, so if you think about it in
    terms of the XML hierarchy, you are really going up a level and then
    back down a level when you are creating a new HTML element to
    contain the script, so that is the most common way. Most of the
    examples that are out there are injecting up, but there is also
    examples of what I call injecting down, and that is when you don’t
    go up first, you don’t have to escape the current context.
    Essentially, you create a code context within your current context,
    and you do this, for example when you’re in a URL context and you
    can control the URL. If you go into a JavaScript URL context, you
    are really creating another level down from the URL context, so this
    is useful because, from an attacker’s point of view, when you are
    thinking about the possibilities for injecting cross-site script
    into a particular place in HTML, you can think about, well are there
    any ways to go up, meaning close the current context and create
    another context outside that , or you can think about are there ways
    to inject down, like can I create a code context within the current
    context that I’m in without closing the current context, so that’s
    what injecting up and injecting down are about, and it has a big
    effect on which characters you need to be very careful about
    escaping.

Jim Manico

  -
    Jeff, as you mentioned earlier, the real solution to XSS, the real
    defense, is outbound coding. I hear a lot of different terms used. I
    hear outbounding coding, I hear outbound escaping, I see some folks
    who say just do HTML entity encoding and you’re all set.

Jeff Williams

  -
    Essentially, what they mean is changing some of the characters so
    that they no longer are the special characters that are significant
    in the interpreter to something that is safe, something that the
    interpreter will treat just as data. The problem is every different
    interpreter has a different syntax for escaping, so HTML has its own
    form, CSS has its own form, JavaScript has its own type of escaping.
    You can read about some of these in the actual cheat sheet page, but
    it doesn’t really even stop there. Operating systems all have their
    own escape format. Every database vendor has their own escaping
    rules. It’s really kind of ridiculous how many different forms of
    output escaping there are, and it makes it virtually impossible for
    the developer to keep all that in their head. That’s why I have said
    numerous times that you need a security encoding or escaping library
    that knows how to escape for the different interpreters that you’re
    dealing with. That way we can get it right once and everyone can use
    those same things, and I’ll probably mention that that’s exactly
    what we’re building as one part of the ESAPI project, also at OWASP.

Jim Manico

  -
    So Jeff, again, I see I a lot of folks who even today are still
    writing just HTML entity encode everything on output and you’re all
    set. Why is this terribly wrong?

Jeff Williams

  -
    Well, HTML entity encoding is pretty powerful. It disables the
    simple kinds of scripts if your untrusted data is just ending up in
    regular HTML, or even in HTML attributes in most cases, like if it’s
    a quoted attribute. We might talk a little more about that later,
    but it’s not good enough to stop cross-site scripting in other
    contexts like in CSS or inside a JavaScript block or in an on
    mouse-over event. HTML entity escaping doesn’t work in those
    contexts, so you can have all of the HTML entity encoding you want
    and the script will still run, it’s just not good enough. I wish
    there was an easier way to do this. We’ve tried very hard to make
    the Cross-Site Scripting Prevention Cheat Sheet as absolutely simple
    as possible and still work.

Jim Manico

  -
    So speaking of which, let’s start marching through these rules. I’m
    looking at your cheat sheet now and rule number zero says never
    insert untrusted data except in allowed locations. What are some of
    these illegal locations that data can never be displayed in a safe
    way?

Jeff Williams

  -
    I think probably, if you thought hard enough about it, you could
    come up with a way to escape data in almost any location, untrusted
    data, in almost any location in an HTML document, but some of them
    are really tricky edge-cases where I can’t think of a really good
    use case for doing it. It would be like inside a Meta Tag, using a
    JavaScript. I mean, there are these nested contexts where the
    encoding gets pretty tricky, and we just didn’t think that met the
    sort of 80-20 rule on what most developers ought to be doing. If you
    need to put untrusted data in some crazy place in your HTML, then
    this is your heads up. Really think hard about how it needs to be
    escaped. You probably need to do some testing to make sure that
    untrusted data can’t possibly introduce a script in that context, so
    rule number zero is basically saying deny all. It says don’t put
    untrusted data in your document unless you are putting it in one of
    the five contexts that we talk about in the rest of the document.
    One of the biggest places where you really shouldn’t put untrusted
    data is in a script tag, like right in the middle of a JavaScript.
    It’s very difficult to escape data if it’s right in the middle of a
    JavaScript block, and we do see this. I’ve seen a number of apps
    that have something like a URL parameter called call-back, and it
    actually contains JavaScript code, and then when the app renders
    that page it takes that JavaScript code and sticks it into the web
    page. Well, you’re never going to be able to escape that properly.
    Just don’t do that anymore. Please don’t pass around JavaScript in
    URL parameters or form parameters or hidden fields or anything or
    cookies. That’s crazy. Stick to some other approach for handling
    your call-backs.

Jim Manico

  -
    Yeah, that sounds like XSS as a feature.

Jeff Williams

  -
    It really is, but you’d be surprised how many apps actually do that.

Jim Manico

  -
    So the next rule, rule number one is HTML-escape before inserting
    untrusted data into the HTML element context.

Jeff Williams

  -
    Exactly, so this is the normal use case for building a web page.
    You’re taking untrusted data like the users name from a form field
    or something and you’re going to end up rendering that in the HTML
    body somewhere, like, Hi, Jeff. In that case you want to take that
    untrusted data and you just want to HTML-entity encode it. We’ve
    provided a list of six characters that are really important to
    escape in that context. We included the slash because it is part of
    the XML browser, the XML documents parser, so we’re trying to be
    better safe than sorry here and over-encode just a little bit. In
    general, I think you’ll see that the cheat sheet is conservative
    that way. It instructs you to over-encode a little bit because,
    frankly, nobody knows exactly how all of the corner cases in the
    browser work, except for Garreth Hayes and he’s ridiculous.

Jim Manico

  -
    Now Jeff, I’m of the mind to encode every single character other
    than alpha-numerics. Why do you think we’ve moved away from that and
    are encoding less characters?

Jeff Williams

  -
    Well, we did get a lot of push-back on encoding everything because,
    well, it’s a couple of reasons. One, I think it makes your HTML look
    a little messy, and when we sat down and analyzed it we couldn’t
    think of a good reason why this would cause a problem in the HTML
    element context. Now when we get to the attribute context the rules
    are going to be different and so, I think if you want to have one
    method that does HTML entity encoding or escaping, then you better
    encode a lot more than just these big six, but if you’re willing to
    bite off the difficulty of having two different methods that
    developers can keep track of, then it’s okay to only encode the big
    six in the regular HTML element context, but when we get to
    attributes, you’ve got to encode a little bit more. Now it’s
    interesting, some environments have escape method already in there,
    PHP has one and dot net has one. Interestingly, Java does not have
    an HTML entity encoding method and I have gone to great lengths to
    work with the Servlet spec team to try to get one built in there and
    I haven’t made much progress, unfortunately, but I don’t see how you
    can field a platform today without providing support for these kind
    of escaping formats.

Jim Manico

  -
    So Jeff, can you just quickly explain to us what you mean for this
    rule one by the HTML element context real quick?

Jeff Williams

  -
    Yeah, the HTML element context is the data that goes between tags
    like body or div. It’s your normal HTML body content.

Jim Manico

  -
    So moving onto rule two, it’s saying attribute escape before
    inserting untrusted data into HTML common attributes.

Jeff Williams

  -
    So here we’re looking at a different context within the HTML
    document. We’re looking at attributes. Attributes are things like if
    you have a name or a value, it might be a form input value, so
    you’ll have a tag that says input, name equals something and value
    equals something. If you’re taking untrusted data and putting it
    into those attributes, this is the rule that you’ll want to apply,
    and you’ll notice it says common attributes, so here we’re not
    talking about the more complex attributes like on blur and on
    mouse-click and all of those different things. We’re talking about
    the simple attributes that aren’t sort of scripting or style
    related.

Jim Manico

  -
    So Jeff, why is this method encoding more characters than normal
    HTML entity encoding?

Jeff Williams

  -
    Well, the reason is that so many web applications don’t properly
    quote their attributes. The HTML browsers are fairly forgiving
    parsers and they don’t always require you to quote, even though the
    XML spec says you should and HTML Tidy says you should. It doesn’t
    really matter. The browsers render stuff unquoted just fine and the
    problem with that is that unquoted attributes can be terminated by a
    whole bunch of different characters like space and tab and vertical
    tab and all sorts of weird characters can terminate. Even things
    like plus and percent and equals and less-than and so on can
    terminate attributes. Now if you did guarantee that all your
    attributes were properly quoted either with single quotes or double
    quotes, then really the only thing you’d need to make sure you
    escape is the corresponding quote, but I think that is a very
    dangerous practice, so we’re recommending that if you are putting
    untrusted data in the attributes, just go ahead and escape
    everything, because in there are all the special characters. You
    don’t have to escape characters like alpha-numerics, but escape
    all of the other stuff and make sure that even if a developer
    accidentally puts in an untrusted attribute it won’t allow an
    attacker to break out and introduce a script.

Jim Manico

  -
    Rule number three, JavaScript escape before inserting untrusted data
    into HTML JavaScript data values.

Jeff Williams

  -
    Okay, there is a lot of little words there, so this is for when
    you’re taking untrusted data and you’re putting it inside a
    JavaScript, and more specifically you’re putting it inside a data
    value inside a JavaScript. I want to be really clear. I don’t want
    people to be taking data and just putting it straight inside a
    JavaScript context. We’re talking about a very narrow use case, like
    when you need to set a variable to the value of some untrusted data
    like X equals five, and you happen to have gotten that five from the
    HTTP request. That’s when you need to use JavaScript escaping to
    make sure that the attacker can’t break out of that value, and
    JavaScript escaping is considerably different than HTML entity
    escaping. If you use HTML entity escaping it won’t work. It won’t do
    what you want and, in fact, the attack might still work. JavaScript
    escaping is the backslash-X-hex-hex format, and you need an output
    encoder that supports that if you want to generate data in that
    format, so again I will point to the…reference implementation. We’ve
    got encoders for all of these different schemes.

Jim Manico

  -
    You mentioned Garreth Hayes, well, Garreth Hayes says I’m sure I can
    break your encoder, so he sent me a string, I encoded it, sent it
    back to him and he was like, well, what do you know, you’re doing it
    right, so we got the Garreth Hayes thumbs-up on this encoder as well
    by the way.

Jeff Williams

  -
    If you’ve got a Garreth Hayes…then you’re doing pretty good.

Jim Manico

  -
    So next we have rule number four. CSS escape before inserting
    untrusted data into HTML style property values.

Jeff Williams

  -
    Yeah, so this is another interesting context within HTML. This is a
    CSS context and it can either be an embedded style sheet or it might
    be a style tag that is associated with one of the divs or something.
    We’re saying you are allowed to use untrusted data in here but only
    if in a certain context, in a style property, and so you will see a
    couple of examples in the sheet of just where you are allowed to put
    it, but it’s basically in the definition of a property, so in the
    place where you would put a color or a font style or something. You
    are allowed to put some data there, but you’ve got to escape it to
    make sure that the attacker can’t break out of the context or
    introduce a sub context, so to break out of one of these contexts,
    there are some special characters that somebody might use, things
    like space and tab and percent and some of the attribute kinds of
    special characters, but there are also sub contexts to be considered
    here, like -moz-binding or some of the, in IE there is the
    expression context that can create a sub context here, so you need
    to be really careful, and there is a note in here about that, but
    you need to be really careful about how you deal with untrusted data
    in CSS and certainly use the escaping format. Now CSS escaping is
    another different format. It’s backslash-hex-hex, so you can’t just
    use HTML encoding or JavaScript encoding. There is a separate
    escaping format for this.

Jim Manico

  -
    Next we have rule number five. URL escape before inserting untrusted
    data into HTML URL attributes.

Jeff Williams

  -
    Alright, so you may have heard of URL encoding or possibly percent
    encoding. We’re calling it URL escaping here, but it is all the same
    thing. It means, in this case, the format is percent-hex-hex and
    when you’re inserting untrusted data into a URL, you need to make
    sure it’s escaped. Now you want to be careful here to make sure
    you’re inserting this untrusted data within the right spot in the
    URL. You shouldn’t let an attacker control the entire URL because
    then they could provide, and this is a URL, it might be used in an
    image tag, it might be used in an image or a link or a script source
    or an iFrame, any of those HREFs are URLs that need to be escaped in
    this way, and you don’t want to let the attacker provide the whole
    URL because then they might provide a JavaScript URL. That would be
    an example of injecting down, so you want to be careful to make sure
    you put the untrusted data somewhere on the tail end of the URL, and
    then you want to make sure you escape it right using the percent
    escaping, and the last thing you need to be sure you don’t do is you
    want to make sure you don’t escape things like ampersands and
    question marks and equals. You are intending to allow this URL to
    actually work because you will override the query string and the
    parameters within it, so you need to decide are you passing the
    entire URL as a parameter and so you want to escape those things or
    are you intending for someone to be able to click on this thing and
    you want to escape the data values within it. That’s something where
    we’ve got one method available in this API to do this and we’ll
    probably extend that to provide a slightly different method if you
    want to escape the parts of a URL.

Jim Manico

  -
    Speaking of that, what do you think is the future for this XSS Cheat
    Sheet? Where do you go now?

Jeff Williams

  -
    Well, we’ve gotten a lot of great feedback from developers that find
    this really useful. This finally explains it, what they are actually
    supposed to do to stop cross-site scripting in a good way and we
    have taking it and we’re building it into a…so we’ve got actually
    the code to back this up, but really what we need to do is make sure
    that we get this into the hands of the developers that need it and
    what I would like to see is I would like to see more web apps move
    to a more templated kind of system where they are using components
    to generate their HTML and then the component designers will have to
    know these rules, but most developers won’t have to use these rules
    anymore, so I’d like to see JSF and the other templating systems or
    component systems start to build these rules into their frameworks
    so that most developers don’t need to know about this. Currently,
    unfortunately, it’s really spotty. OWASP did a project where we
    looked at all the different JSF components and unfortunately, it’s
    not clear which parts of the components do escaping properly and
    which don’t, and there are certainly some places that don’t do it
    properly, so there is still a lot of work here to do to get the
    world to a place where we can reasonably think about stamping out
    cross-site scripting. This is just one piece of the foundation.
    There is an awful lot of work that we’ve got left to do. That said,
    I’ve done a lot of work with companies that are actively stamping
    out cross-site scripting. They’ve taking these rules, they’ve built
    them into their own frameworks and libraries, and they’re making a
    big deal about it and it’s starting to work. They are seeing
    significant reductions in the amount of cross-site scripting flaws
    that they have. It just requires some diligence and you can stamp it
    out. It’s an important thing to do because XSS represents a
    significant risk, particularly to the users of your system, but also
    to your system itself, so it’s a worthwhile goal. Certainly from a
    risk perspective, we think it absolutely deserves to be right up
    there at the top of the OWASP Top Ten.

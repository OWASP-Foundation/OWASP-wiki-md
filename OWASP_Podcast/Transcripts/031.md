    We have with us today Mark Curphey. Mark is the original founder of
    the OWASP foundation. He is currently the Director of Information
    Security Tools at Microsoft and recently contributed to the
    collaborative security book for O’Reilly called Beautiful Security.
    Mark, you are the founder of OWASP. Can you give us some back story
    as to why you started the Open Web Application Security Project and
    who were some of the other players who started the foundation with
    you?

Mark Curphey

  -
    Sure, so in reality, I was just one of a bunch of people. I guess
    technically, I came up with the idea first, so the way it happened,
    I used to moderate a…security focus called WebAppSec. I think it is
    still running. It is not as popular as it used to be. I had just
    left a job. I actually was running a consulting team for ISS,
    Internet Security Systems, where we were predominately focused on
    network security. We had built an Internet scanner and real secure
    and other sort of network systems. I was running a consulting team.
    The majority of the guys that were working for me were breaking into
    clients through penetration testing, through the application there.
    It became intriguing to me how this was happening. It just so
    happened that two of the guys who were working for me actually were
    Caleb Seymour and Brian Christian who went off and founded
    Spikonomics, but kind of a side story, I guess, so I kind of come
    from this arena. Cut a long story short, my wife got pregnant. We
    were living in Atlanta and decided we didn't want to bring up
    children in the south, so I took a job at Charles Schwab, running
    network security. What I quickly discovered was that back in 2000,
    there were very few people talking about software security. There
    were a bunch of startups, a bunch of people really talking about
    technologies that they were already trying to sell, but it was
    heavily focused on marketing, real sort of… being pushed, so I
    punted out an idea amongst a couple of people that I knew, a guy
    from another big bank on the east coast and a guy called David
    Endler down at iDefense, Steve Taylor over there at…I had met who
    was in Germany. I said hey, we should all get together and write a
    guide that really kind of captures the things the really matter and
    go figure out what it does. No preconceived notion, no kind of grand
    plans. We bashed out a very quick guide, a very quick document
    collaboratively. All of a sudden everything kind of snowballed.
    People started joining and volunteering. The rest is history. Just
    one of these fantastic collaborative, open source internet projects.
    A whole bunch of people that I have met over the time have become
    very good friends. I hook up with folks like David Endler whenever I
    am in Austin and all sorts of fantastic people. It was a wonderful
    experience.

Jim Manico

  -
    So, Mark what do you think has changed in this industry since the
    early days of OWASP?

Mark Curphey

  -
    So, if anything, this sort of awareness. If you look back through
    history, I guess everything was originally network security based.
    Then, everything moved up the stack around operating systems. Then,
    everyone became aware of applications. If anything, we have seen
    that sort of natural progression. I think that things like OWASP
    have helped people understand where the real threats are and where
    the real issues are, and how to deal with them, so there is a huge
    credibility to that. I think that there has been this sort of
    natural evolution and I guess people always focus on the low hanging
    fruit and the lowest common denominator. Certainly, the security
    industry as I see it has evolved and is continuing to evolve. You
    know, it used to be all the network security guys and now there is a
    whole software security industry in there as well, so as that stuff
    changes, people start to understand and change and figure out the
    stuff that is really important.

Jim Manico

  -
    So, Mark what were the catalytic moments in the early days of the
    OWASP project?

Mark Curphey

  -
    You know, I look back and my wife would kind of laugh if she was
    here... back in the early days, we lived in California, and she
    would always come in at four o’clock in the morning and there would
    be me on my cell phone and IM. I think the real catalytic stuff in
    the real early days were a small tightly knit bunch of guys with
    very altruistic values enjoying working together. I think that was
    absolutely fantastic. There was no kind of grand plan. There was no
    politics. It was like hey, here is a cool thing to do. Let’s go
    ahead and do it. You are getting great feedback and great success
    immediately from the incident, so I think it was a new experience
    for all of us. Certainly it was extremely enjoyable. If you fast
    forward a little bit, the real catalytic moment from what I can see
    was actually what Jeff and Dave put in place. I have got to be
    honest, at that time I thought it was the absolute opposite thing to
    do, so OWASP was going through a real challenging phase. It had
    grown very quickly and produced a lot of content. Some of that
    content was of questionable quality. It had been open to all, and
    kind of naturally if you open things to everyone, you get absolutely
    fantastic quality content and you get some which is less so, so I
    really had this bee in my bonnet about what was in order for OWASP
    to grow. The most important thing is going to be figuring out a way
    to get a much better published provocation process, a much kind of
    tighter process with rules and processes around it. A lot of other
    people said what you actually want is a wiki. Wikis were new at the
    time, not really well understood. I certainly did not understand
    them at all. I understood this concept that you just allow everyone
    to edit and write. Now that problem is going to get ten times worse.
    When you look back now, that was absolutely a catalytic moment. It
    allowed everyone to contribute without going through the process.
    All of a sudden you got this swarm effect. The natural community
    stuff kicked in of validating and improving content, so I think
    looking back from the whole time that I have been actively involved
    or been watching, I think the real thing was that wiki. I think Jeff
    or Dave, one of those guys has absolute credit for that because that
    was thing that really made it take off.

Jim Manico

  -
    So what do you think of the leaders of OWASP who have taken the
    responsibility of stewardship of the organization as you have moved
    on to other endeavors?

Mark Curphey

  -
    You know, absolutely fantastic, so I had the pleasure of spending
    time with Dave and Jeff quite a lot and they came to the party…They
    were not there in the immediate phase, but it was obvious to me that
    when Jeff and Dave started getting involved that they were doing it
    for the right reasons. For various reasons, I was not involved in
    the way I was hoping. I started looking at doing other things. It
    was clear that we needed to find people who would take it in the
    right direction. There were a number of different options. There
    were certainly a lot of vendors who were interested in engaging and
    taking over. That certainly would have been for the wrong reasons.
    What I saw in Jeff and Dave, particularly, were a bunch of guys who
    were doing things for the right reasons. They were prepared to make
    commitments without making expectations of things in return. That
    was absolutely huge. Dennis is just a fantastic guy. I don't spend
    enough time with him. I have not done so since I have been in
    England. One of my favorite uber smart people and always engaging
    and always entertaining. Sebastian Schneider…I will butcher his name
    on your behalf, Jim, is also dedicated and fantastic. Tom Brennan, I
    don't know and have not had the pleasure of meeting, but I have
    heard nothing but fantastic things. When I look at it, I think great
    bunch of people. The results speak for themselves, like anything in
    life. You just look at the results, and that has got to speak
    volumes for the leaders.

Jim Manico

  -
    Mark, when I was researching your history I saw that you used to
    refer to yourself as a Java bigot, and when I read that, I was like
    I like this guy. Then there is this dark period in your life where
    we can't find much about you. Then, next thing we see is a pipe
    sticking out of your head, and you are a full time member for life
    of the Microsoft Corporation. Can you tell us about that transition
    from Java to dot net?

Mark Curphey

  -
    Yeah, so at Charles Schwab I was responsible for software security.
    Schwab was one of the biggest software producers on the west coast.
    We had at one point nearly a trillion dollars in assets, vast
    infrastructures, and we were a Java shop. That is really where I cut
    my teeth learning about software security in the real world. I kind
    of plummeted into building a software security program and going
    ahead and implementing it. We had 350,000 developers. We had QA in
    Russia and dev all over the world, stuff going on in India. That is
    really where I kind of cut my teeth. I really learned a lot about
    large scale enterprise Java implementation. I think that is where
    the Java bigot stuff came from. I am at Microsoft now and a huge
    proponent of dot net, still a big fan of Java, and absolutely a huge
    fan of the open source model, both in terms of the open source
    business model and social model, so I guess if anything, I would
    kind of just remove the bigot part from my name now, if that's at
    all possible.

Jim Manico

  -
    Would you care to tell us more about what you are doing at Microsoft
    today?

Mark Curphey

  -
    Sure. I run the information security calls team. I have around 25
    developers, full-time developers around 15, vendors, contractors
    working in the team, and we are split between Redmond, Hyderabad in
    India, and the sustained engineering team is in Beijing and China,
    so we own a couple of different functions, one of which is to build
    software security calls, so we have a manage code scanning tool, a
    static analysis tool called CAT.NET. We have a protection library
    called MTXFS. Then we have one of the threat monitoring tools. There
    are two threat modeling tools at Microsoft, so we have one of those
    called the Threat Modeling and Analysis tool, so that is in sort of
    the software security cell. We have another cell that does identify
    and access engineering, so engineering around the implementation of
    the Microsoft identity management stuff, or our internal deployment,
    so we obviously have a large number of employees and a large number
    of systems. We have a product called Forefront Identity Manager, so
    we own the engineering of the implementation side of that. In the
    past, we have built all the tools around group management for active
    directory and all sorts of clever things that I have. You know,
    markcurphey@microsoft.com, even though my alias is
    mcurphey@microsoft.com, things like that…Then we have another cell
    of folks who are building operations tools, so have some tools that
    go out and scan the network and find the vulnerabilities and unpatch
    machines, and all those sort of things. Also, then looking at data
    classification tools…so tools that can go out and pass through a
    SharePoint or through a FileStore or through an exchange mailbox and
    find where people may be accidentally, nudge nudge, storing
    sensitive data and things like that, so a bunch of projects going on
    in that space, software security, identity management, operations.
    The fourth area is security management, so we have a cell…This is
    one of the reasons that I went to Microsoft. We have a cell that is
    building security management tools, so think about things like
    business continuity management tools to track business continuity
    plans, high level risk tracking plans, information score cards, all
    of those sort of things. We are fundamentally underneath that,
    building a development framework, so the notion is that every large
    scale organization has a combination of off the shelf tools and they
    have custom tools. Normally, the majority of those custom tools are
    architecturally balls of mud. They have kind of grown up from
    something that was originally built out of proof of concept. Some
    guy takes that and puts it into production. The next minute you know
    the business is relying on it. Then there are five or six of these
    things trying to work together and all of a sudden none of it
    scales, so what we are building is a development framework that
    allows you to build scalable custom web application including the
    ability to integrate your office shelf stuff, so we have to pull in
    information from the likes of cat UPC code scanner or maybe even
    other code scanning tools, network scanning tools, hook in to detect
    tracking systems, notification systems, all that sort of stuff so
    you can build a proper architecture to support the information
    security system. The fifth cell is sustained engineering. That stuff
    happens out in Beijing and doing sort of CRs and change request
    things.

Jim Manico

  -
    This is a question from Jeff Williams. Mark, why at first did you
    think that XSS was a nonissue and in general, how did your opinion
    on cross-site scripting change over time?

Mark Curphey

  -
    So, I went back to Jeff, I guess who sort of had this
    conversation…so I still believe there are huge amounts of hype
    around it. Let me fully qualify that statement. I fully understand
    the potential of it and I fully understand that things have
    certainly moved on. If you go back a number of years, there are a
    number of people essentially saying that the world is falling down.
    When I first became responsible for software security at Charles
    Schwab, we were on the front page of the Wall Street Journal for
    that cross-site scripting issue. Notice that you had all sorts of
    monitoring and all sorts of stuff in place…The reality was that
    there were very few customers complaining about the issue, but there
    were an awful lot of media people, so what we were seeing was that
    it was very easy for security people to say the potential for this
    is, wow, this is going to happen to you and everything else is going
    to happen. The reality was that those things were not happening, so
    fundamentally, it is my belief that there are these things called
    risk management and you have to stand by that. It was really a
    stance around absolutely understanding that the potential impact of
    this is pretty large, but we are not seeing those things get
    exploited. Now, I think that what we have seen clearly over time as
    things become more and more connected, that those things are
    becoming exploited. We are starting to see worms replicated and
    those sort of things. One of the things I have always believed is
    that cross-site scripting has diverted a lot of people's attention
    away from other issues, which are absolutely significant and in many
    cases much bigger issues. For example, the majority of application
    security people you talk to will absolutely understand how
    cross-site scripting works. They will be able to tell you all of the
    issues, all of the attack vectors. Then, you talk to a lot of them
    about how a MQ would work or some sort of thing like that, which is
    maybe pushing billions of dollars a day from a back end system and
    has a potential for massive amounts of damage. They probably will
    not be able to tell you how those things work at all. I think that
    another part of cross-site scripting is that I think it diverted and
    continues to divert a lot of attention away from really big really
    important issues.

Jim Manico

  -
    Mark, developers' tools in general have gotten less expensive, and
    in fact, there are a lot of very solid developers' tools in the open
    source space, especially in the Java world, so because of that, it
    is very often difficult to justify budget with developer tools, so
    in general, what do you think are the best ways that an organization
    can justify spending real money on software security initiatives?

Mark Curphey

  -
    So we agree that CAT.NET that my team produces is free and the
    intention is for it to always be that way. I think that there are a
    lot of great tools. I think if you look at software security in
    general, an awful lot of people think that they are going to be able
    to buy a shiny red button, press it, and the problem is going to go
    away. The reality is that it is not going to work like that, so it's
    a people process and technology problem. You require the right
    people with the right education and motivation, the right skill set.
    You require the right process to ensure that all the right things
    are being done. Then, you require the right technology, either
    through technology choices using frameworks or those sort of things
    or technology to help secure implementations. If you could go back
    and could spend any money on anything, I am still a firm believer…I
    know it is a real old cliché, teaching a man to fish or whatever
    that phrase is. I really think that the best money spent is on
    educating motivated, skilled people into how to solve the problems.
    I think that becomes a scalable thing. You know, if you go back to
    the days when I was running software security at Charles Schwab, one
    of the real key things that we did was find champions out in the
    business and developers. Do not try to scale up by trying to clone
    security people. Try to find development champions who understand
    security and go and implement that stuff in their development cells.
    I really think that is incredibly wise money to spend it around on
    training. That is not to say that the other choices do not have
    significant benefits. Clearly they do. Like you say, there are a lot
    of great software, the threat modeling tools that we produce give
    that a plug, CAT.NET, and there are a bunch of other great tools
    that can get people a long way. If you are not focused on that,
    people in process …which, in general requires a different sort of
    approach, I think it is often money well spent.

Jim Manico

  -
    I have heard a lot of folks from the network security, and I dare
    say the WAF community, who say well, fixing the code is a real tough
    proposition. We have tens of millions if not tens of billions of
    vulnerabilities out in the web and due to the scale problem, we will
    never be able to fix all these vulnerabilities. Do you think there
    is any truth to that? Do you have any thoughts in general on the
    scale of the problem?

Mark Curphey

  -
    People say that you can't tackle it by that. You have to create some
    shiny red button. My answer, I will give you the Microsoft/ Steve
    Ballmer answer, is hogwash, right? That is just absolute utter
    nonsense. What we have seen over the space of the past decade is
    that people follow the money. Network security people are trying to
    follow into the space of software security. It does not transcend
    well because they do not understand software. What they are trying
    to do is to apply old network security processes to software. That
    is really what has happened with these web application files. People
    are trying to apply protocol level protection to a software. It is
    just never going to solve the problem. Sure, it can make inroads,
    depth in defense, all those things, absolutely. Ultimately, you have
    to be able to produce software which can defend itself and protect
    itself. You cannot stick something else in front of it, so I think
    that the argument around can you train developers is fundamentally
    mute. If you look at what Microsoft has done with the SDL and how we
    have changed, it is an absolutely fantastic story. I would not have
    come to Microsoft five or seven years ago. It would not have been a
    great place to work. Now, they have the SDL, which is kind of held
    up as a place where we still have problems and challenges. We're
    certainly not perfect, but we are a very different company than the
    company that was several years ago. That has been through the SDL
    process, which Mike Howard and Steve Lipner, and those guys created
    and a superb bunch of talented people there. Educating all the
    developers, putting them through that training and making them go
    through that process. I think that there is really good tangible
    evidence to say that, that is hogwash.

Jim Manico

  -
    Mark, do you think that compliance is helping or hurting actual web
    security?

Mark Curphey

  -
    I guess, I always kind of smile…You cannot spell compliance without
    alliance, whatever that Dilbert cartoon is, so I have sat on both
    sides of the fence, right? I have run consulting teams. I have been
    in startups as a vendor. I have spent an equal amount of time
    running corporate security programs, so I guess I kind of see it
    from both sides. I think though that the reality is when you are
    running a corporate information security program, compliance is just
    something that you have to do. It is a tax. There are implications
    if you do not do it, and get caught I guess. There are issues.
    Compliance itself is not a driver around building scalable and
    sustainable security programs. I think that there is a vast amount
    of media hype, a vast amount of horrible marketing in the security
    industry and technology industry, in general. They say things like
    you have to go do XY and Z, and you have to do all sorts of things.
    I can tell you that I have had conversations with regulators, agreed
    things, got off the phone with them and some vendor will call me up
    and say, if you have…you are going to be fined 100 million dollars.
    I had just come off the phone conversation with a regulator and
    agreed that here is how we are going to approach something, and this
    is how the implications are, so I think that there is a real gap
    about what is being portrayed in the media and the reality. I think
    that you need to always ask yourself, why is someone telling me this
    and what is their motivation behind it. It is kind of what Al Gore
    said in that film, whatever that climate film he did…If someone’s
    salary is dependent on something, then it is pretty hard to convince
    them of the truth. I think that there is a vast amount of fear,
    uncertainty and doubt being portrayed around compliance. That said,
    the balanced view, of course, is people setting sensible standards,
    sensible ways to do things and building programs around it out of
    either enforcement or auditing. It clearly makes sense, right? It is
    the right thing to do. It is raising the bar and driving the right
    behaviors. I do not think there is a clear no it is bad or yes it is
    good. I think that there are certainly implementation issues and
    problems with the way that stuff happens. I think that is the nature
    of anything where there is money to be made.

Jim Manico

  -
    What do you think is necessary to interact with an offshore or some
    sort of outsource team and still build secure software?

Mark Curphey

  -
    I have been involved in that model since the early Schwab days, and
    we had QA and Russia, offshore development going on in India. I have
    a team in Beijing now and team in Hyderabad. My view is that
    software is a social process, building it. It is a people process.
    If you wind up with disjointed teams, then you are going to wind up
    with problems that are not just security problems anymore. What you
    need to do is to ensure that you understand the process and
    understand the workflow of how software gets created, ensuring that
    each of the stages in the life cycle or however has roles and
    responsibilities, that they clearly understand what is expected of
    them. I think that it is just naive of people to think that they can
    just ship someone a specification and expect it to turn back and
    become secure. No one can ever write down a document or build a
    checklist of all of the different issues. It is a social process
    that involves the right people, the process, and the right
    technology, so I think that it absolutely can be done because I have
    watched it being done. I have also watched it completely and utterly
    fail. I have found a lot of customers that do offshoring have
    completely and utterly failed. I do not think that there is any one
    specific answer. The things that I have seen that have been
    successful are where customers have partnered with the vendors. They
    made sure that they understand what those expectations are. They do
    not just make the expectation that someone is going to deliver those
    things. A lot of people think that I am going to write some contract
    here, write some specifications, hand it over. We are going to
    validate it against the specification. If it is not correct, I am
    going to whip out my appendix and my contract. I think that it is
    just a more complex thing to do, and failing software is about
    people. You have to get all the right people aligned, understanding
    all the right expectations, roles, and responsibilities. That stuff
    generally just creates results.

Jim Manico

  -
    So, Mark, your blog is entitled The Security Buddha. What are some
    of the common assumptions that you see in application security as
    just illusions?

Mark Curphey

  -
    So I still believe that there are huge amounts of fear, uncertainty,
    and doubt being peddled around the frequency of exploitation and the
    reality of the impact. The potential impact of many of these issues,
    absolutely, certainly, without doubt…To give you an example, I have
    not spoken to Ingo Strunk for years. Ingo would probably laugh at
    this. Back in the early days, we were building an XML Java portal
    with Gay Perfel. Ben and Ingo were building this Java portal to host
    this XML system using SourceForge as a source code management
    system. At the time, there was a whole bunch of attention on OWASP.
    I think googles, gobbles, whatever they called themselves, used to
    do through vulnerability alerts or posting things about OWASP
    cross-site scripting and all sorts of issues, a lot of people
    focusing attention, trying to put egg on the face. What we
    discovered one evening was that Ingo had accidentally committed an
    XML file into the source code suppository that actually had the
    password for the database that was being hosted on the Internet.
    What was interesting about that was that it was an open source
    project with open source code, and that stuff had been out there for
    about three months, and no one had noticed it. The natural reaction
    was oh shit. Christ, what have we done? Maybe we have been owned for
    a couple of months. The reality was that there are all of those
    issues out there. It is an absolute bug farm everywhere and we are
    arguing about things being exploited all the time. That is not the
    case that everything that is out there and everything that is a
    problem is being exploited. We have got to get back to this whole
    thing of risk management. A lot of people talk about risk
    management, but very few people act on it. It is one of these things
    that tends to be a buzz word. People kind of do not necessarily take
    it seriously. There is definitely risk involved. You basically have
    to make a bet. Making a bet involves putting money on the table and
    being prepared to living and dealing with the consequences. I think
    that there are an awful lot of people…I hear people at conferences
    talking about if you find this vulnerability, it has to be fixed
    immediately. There is this very blanket, very matter of fact kind of
    attitude in the security industry, in general. They are saying if
    you get this type of issue it has to be remediated, end of story. In
    some circumstances, absolutely, those things make sense. There are a
    lot of people who just make these blanket statements about things
    without really understanding what the impact could be, the frequency
    of these things, and all of those things that surround making
    informed decisions.

Jim Manico

  -
    So Mark, I see that you are not so much active in OWASP today. May I
    ask why?

Mark Curphey

  -
    Sure. In the early days, what I always hoped OWASP would be was a
    forum of software developers who had a secondary interest in
    security. What has happened is that I think it has become a forum
    for security people who have an interest in software. That is
    absolutely fine, fantastic people involved. Obviously it is a
    wonderful community and all those sort of things. It is just not
    what I had envisioned. What really interested me was design patterns
    and architectures and real software security rather than
    vulnerabilities and enumeration of those issues. So, Dennis and I
    know I have tried to steer things…I think it is absolutely
    fair…Jeff, Dave, and I have had this conversation…If you want
    things to change, it is an open source project. You just suggest the
    change and make it happen. That is absolutely true. It is just that
    I think it has gone in one direction naturally with the mass of
    people behind it. That is just not the natural direction that made
    sense for me. That certainly does not take anything away from the
    project, you know, absolutely fantastic. I had the pleasure of
    meeting a guy, Ward Cunningham, who created the Wiki. Ward used to
    work for Microsoft. We sat in a meeting with Ward about how the Wiki
    evolved and all about the design patterns he did. He said what
    happens with a lot of projects is that they change. They grow
    organically, and if they grow organically some people come in and
    other people leave. Some people stay the course. It is just the way
    that it happens. When I spoke through that with Ward, I realized
    that the project has changed. It is just different. Go away and find
    other things that keep that interest. Allow that thing to blossom
    the way that it is doing, so that is why today…Still, I am on
    speaking terms with Sebastian out at the OWASP Bureau picnic last
    year. I actively talk with Dennis and a whole lot of other people. I
    am certainly involved and a big supporter behind the scenes. In
    fact, I actually sponsored OWASP, got Microsoft to join OWASP
    earlier on in the year…not that I am not a supporter or not engaged
    in that sense. I am just not actively participating and
    contributing.

    Well Mark, I am really grateful that you took the time to interview
    with us. Do you have any final thoughts before we finish up today?

    Gosh, no, I mean apart from saying thanks, and I am honored to
    interview with you. It is a pleasure. I think that the most
    important thing is to spend some time reflecting back on what
    happened when we started this thing. You look at where it is today
    with being promoted by NIST and recognized by all these people all
    around the world…I think it is absolutely phenomenal. I think that
    has taught me, if you have a great idea, talk to a bunch of people
    and decide to do it. Then you can do all sorts of fantastic stuff. I
    keep seeing all these other interesting ideas coming around. It is
    great inspiration for people to be able to say if you have an idea,
    get a collective bunch of people. Use the power of the Internet and
    the power of collaboration to go make a difference. It is certainly
    something I look at with pride.

    Hi. This is Matt Tesauro at AppSec EU 2009. I'm here with Michael
    Coates. Hi, Michael. Would you like to tell us a little bit about
    yourself?

Michael Coates

  -
    Sure. Well you already know my name, Michael Coates. I work at
    Aspect Security, Senior Applications Security Engineer. I mainly do
    application assessments, code reviews. I've got something else
    interesting to throw in there. I used to do penetration assessments
    through mobile phones in prior years. Before that, I actually got to
    do some social engineering at banks with a different company, which
    was quite exciting.

Matt Tesauro

  -
    That sounds like fun work. This time around you did a presentation
    on real-time defenses against application worms and malicious
    attackers, and this is some pretty interesting research you've been
    doing. Would you like to tell us a little bit about that?

Michael Coates

  -
    Sure. We are going a good job in the application world of pushing
    securing application, secure design, preventing cross…All that stuff
    is great, but the big problem we have is…If we can stop an attack,
    that's one thing, but what about the person who is doing it? If
    you're sitting in your house and somebody comes and tries to break
    into your house and starts banging on the walls, banging on the
    windows, you don't just sit there and say ha, ha, ha, we have really
    strong windows. You call the police and take some action. That's
    kind of the idea of this presentation and this research, at least
    the detecting malicious user’s part. We can build into the
    application ways of detecting badness, and when we see bad things,
    we can decide this is a bad user. Once we know it's a bad user,
    we'll kick them out. On the other side of things, when you think
    about application where it gets a little bit more complex, the
    research I was doing and…the presentation was focusing on trend
    monitoring and detection. One thing that's pretty common with worms
    is that they're going to leverage a portion of the application to
    propagate, and if we can detect a sudden uptake in usage, a spike in
    usage of a particular part of the site, we can identify a worm as
    its moving and then shut it down.

Matt Tesauro

  -
    So it seems like you've done a lot of work in this area. It also
    seems to me that it would be rather difficult to divine intent based
    on action. Are there some kind of lessons learned from here that you
    can kind of give us?

Michael Coates

  -
    Sure. Intent is a tricky part, and a big criteria of any IDS or IPS
    type system is your false-positive rate, so one thing we do in the
    absence of project is devise the list of detection points in the two
    main categories. One of those is clear attacks. The other is
    suspicious actions. The big difference is a clear attack is
    something that one, is going to be a malicious activity, but two,
    cannot be done accidentally. A good example of that is a user that's
    sending a post to a page that only accepts…your application knows
    it's supposed to…It knows it doesn't ever accept posts, so if you
    get a post, it's an attack. The reason we know it's an attack with
    basically zero percent false-positive is you don't accidentally
    submit a post. There are a lot of actions that go into creating a
    custom post message.

Matt Tesauro

  -
    Yeah, my mom is not going to inadvertently post to a web form.

Michael Coates

  -
    Exactly. Now, the other side of things…A single tick in a log-in
    field or in a message box or something like that. That gets a little
    questionable, because it could be a fat finger typo, so we put those
    in the suspicious category, where we give them a few of those. Now,
    if you start singing single ticks over and over in different parts
    of the site, that's somebody just trying to stay under the radar. It
    sounds to me for these non-clear attacks, the suspicious attacks,
    you can establish some sort of threshold, to where once I get to
    this level of badness or potentially seems like badness, I can take
    an action.

Matt Tesauro

  -
    Exactly. We cut them a little bit of slack, depending on how much
    rope we want to give them, but eventually we step in and say that's
    enough, you're definitely doing something.

Michael Coates

  -
    Now, is this just theoretical work or do you have a real
    implementation of this, or is this something I can bring in house if
    I have a need for this?

Matt Tesauro

  -
    Yeah, we're moving along. The project started last summer in the
    summer of code for OWASP. Right now, we have the entire guide for
    detection points and then for this presentation here at AppSec EU
    2009, I put together a demo application on the trend monitor inside,
    so I developed not a proof of concept, but a demo functioning social
    networking site, then created an actual application worm, which was
    quite entertaining to actually code one up. Oh yeah, there's a lot
    of things that are simple on paper, but then you put them in
    practice and you learn a few things. Then, I put the AppSensor trend
    monitor into that application and watched it actually defend it, and
    that was pretty cool, so the next steps will be cleaning that up a
    little bit and getting it to the point where people can download it
    and have some lessons learned from looking through that.

Michael Coates

  -
    So it almost seems to me that this could bring in sort of more of
    the DOD defense type of idea of resiliency in software assurance,
    and not only have defenses in place, but actually have a means for
    an application to defend itself and react.

Matt Tesauro

  -
    Exactly. That's really the main idea here is that the application
    needs to react on its own. We can't do this log monitoring review
    that's so passive and after the fact. A big point that I do make in
    this documentation for AppSensor is that we need to bring all of
    this knowledge inside the app, because inside the application, you
    understand everything. You understand the users, you understand
    access control, and you get a lot more information. Now, if you
    attempt to do all of this stuff on the outside with a WAF, you would
    lose all of that benefit. The biggest thing you lose if that
    responsive ability. Again, detection without reaction is not going
    to do you much.

Michael Coates

  -
    Well, and I imagine WAFs at best have no clue about the session, and
    the applications have a great idea of context in which the actions
    are happening.

Matt Tesauro

  -
    Exactly. The WAF is just really limited on what they can do. There's
    a place, in my opinion, a small place for WAFs, but this is not it.

Michael Coates

  -
    Excellent, well this sounds like some fantastic research. Have I
    missed out anything? Have I left out something? I want to make sure
    we get good coverage here.

Matt Tesauro

  -
    I think we hit a lot of the big issues. The presentation today
    focused on the trend monitoring stuff, and I think that's kind of
    cutting edge a little bit. Maybe it will be a little tricky to
    implement, but the detection point part of AppSensor is really
    something we can start looking at today and really putting into our
    applications. It bewilders me that we just allow attackers to keep
    trying until they're successful. I bet we can detect them before
    they can find the holes in our application.

Michael Coates

  -
    Let's hope so. Well, thank you very much.

### Transcript

Jim Manico

    We have with us today Ken van Wyk. Ken is a CERT-certified computer
    security incident handler, as well as an internationally recognized
    information security expert and author of the popular O'Reilly
    books, Incident Response and Secure Coding: Principles and
    Practices. Hey Ken, thank you very much for being here.

Ken van Wyk

  -
    Hey Jim, it is good to be here. Thanks for having me.

Jim Manico

  -
    Ken, can you start by telling us how you got involved in IT and what
    eventually got you into the world of web application security?

Ken van Wyk

  -
    Well for starters, I do have some software background many years
    back. Along the way doing IT security, pin testing, and things like
    that, I recognized that I just could not answer the questions that
    my customers had, namely are we secure? I can put firewalls around
    it, we can put in intrusion detection systems, but fundamentally, I
    just knew that we could not answer the question that they were
    asking unless we could see inside the software that they were
    running, so it just to me seemed like an obvious and natural thing
    to want to focus more attention into the software itself.

Jim Manico

  -
    What are some of the challenges you faced as your career shifted
    more into application security?

Ken van Wyk

  -
    Well, I have to say that just convincing people that there are no
    quick fixes. You can't just put a firewall in front of something and
    expect it to be secure, because along came things like web app
    firewalls. They say, well, we can just put this web app firewall in
    front of this software. My answer to that is well, it's useful, it
    does some neat stuff, but it's not going to make you secure. I
    understand that is a controversial thing, but that has been the
    biggest challenge is just convincing people to pay serious attention
    to the software.

Jim Manico

  -
    Has that task gotten easier over time as there has been more
    industry awareness about application security in general?

Ken van Wyk

  -
    I think it has a little bit. I think that nowadays, I don't have to
    struggle quite as much, I suppose, to convince a decision maker that
    the solution has to be in the software as well. I think that is
    partially because of all the bad news that we hear about. I do think
    it's gotten a little bit easier, but not a lot.

Jim Manico

  -
    Ken, you have been a very vocal opponent of pin testing, yet you
    yourself are a pin tester to some degree, so what do you think is
    wrong with pin testing based assessment?

Ken van Wyk

  -
    Well, fundamentally, I don't think that it is wrong. I think it is
    an important thing to do. I think that we have to do pin testing and
    application pin testing in particular. Where I disagree with it is
    where people do that as their only thing in terms of security
    testing. It is a very outside-in driven sort of a process, poking at
    some software from across a network and seeing if we can get it to
    break is good and useful for a lot of things, but unless we are
    looking inside the software, we are going to miss a lot of stuff. We
    can test inputs against known attack patterns and things like that
    and hopefully, that will bear some low hanging fruit. When you
    really want to focus on things like PCI compliance and such and how
    secure the software is inside, we have got to be doing a lot more in
    security testing other than application pin testing from the outside
    in.

Jim Manico

  -
    Ken, would you like to give us your thoughts on OWASP and possibly
    tell us what your favorite OWASP project is?

Ken van Wyk

  -
    You know, there are so many things. I am a huge fan of OWASP. I have
    been a believer in what OWASP is doing for several years now, since
    I first ran into them. There are several things that are really
    useful, but I think just kind of strategically thinking a little
    bit, I have to say my pet project is WebGoat. I think that it has
    been responsible for opening up more application developers' eyes
    and giving them a tool that they can really internalize what a
    problem is. I think that is, in the long run, educating those
    application developers with tools like WebGoat. That's going to help
    solve a lot of issues over time. The stories I use are things that
    have come from my own experiences. I use them based on who I am
    talking to, so if I think that a particular story is really going to
    work well with this audience because they will get it and it will in
    turn help them internalize an issue, that's the one I pull out. I
    try to make them as topical as I can based on the sort of people and
    the sort of backgrounds that I am talking to. I did an application
    review of a credit card paying system for a big hotel chain not that
    long ago. That is one I use a lot because Java people can really
    internalize it, and we look at some of the mistakes people make with
    things like incorrect use of cryptography. The cryptography problem
    in that case study or that project turned out to be a huge issue.
    There is no great solution to the problems that they faced, so we
    look at the architecture and discuss it. Then, we talk about the
    real world problems that these guys face with regard to encrypting
    credit cards. That tends to work very well for a lot of Java people
    because they realize that there is no perfect solution to things.
    You just have to make the best business decision that you can.

Jim Manico

  -
    Ken, if you had the attention of all the Fortune 100 CIOs, what
    would you want to tell them with regard to application security?

Ken van Wyk

  -
    There is just no quick fix. We want to be able to take like a top
    ten list and check off all ten boxes on our audit checklist and say
    we are done with this. That is not solving the problem. That solves
    ten little issues, but not the problem. Software security is a lot
    like quality. You can't just take a checklist and all of a sudden
    now you are developing quality stuff, so it's a lifestyle change,
    and you have to pay attention to that at a big picture level, as
    well as paying attention to those checklist sort of approaches. I
    say that not to throw stones at projects like the OWASP top ten,
    because that's useful and valuable stuff. To the CIOs of the world,
    guys and gals, there is no quick fix. Let us pay attention to the
    bigger problems.

Jim Manico

  -
    Ken, web application security can be a rather daunting topic for the
    beginner. Do you have a recommendation for a software engineer who
    is first approaching the topic of application security?

Ken van Wyk

  -
    One thing that I tell all of my customers is that a cheap and quick
    and wonderful learning tool that I have mentioned in here already is
    to get all of your developers a copy of WebGoat and make them work
    through all of those exercises. Directly to the developers, I would
    say learn, soak up all of the information, read and understand that
    people are going to break things in ways that you have not
    anticipated, so open your mind up and look at the way that people
    break things. That is why I like WebGoat so much, because it makes
    you understand how things break. A lot of times as a software
    engineer, you are thinking functional specification. You are
    thinking functionality. When you see how people break things, it
    really makes you kind of scratch your head and go boy, I had not
    really considered looking at it that way. Opening your mind up that
    way is extremely useful.

Jim Manico

  -
    Ken, do you have any advice for the information security
    professional who is trying to get through to software engineers to
    really care about this topic?

Ken van Wyk

  -
    So, that is an excellent question. I find that a lot of people that
    do information security, pin testing, and things like that, that get
    in front of software developers…A mistake that is commonly made is
    that we infosec people think of the world from a network security
    standpoint. It is not just about the seven layers, right? We have to
    understand the software. If you are going to stand in front of a
    room of software developers and presume to tell them a little bit
    about software security or application security, you have got to
    meet them halfway at least and understand their technologies. It
    does not mean that you have to be able to write Java code or C Sharp
    code, but you better understand the technologies that they deal
    with. It's not just an issue of hey, SQL injection is really bad,
    but you've got to be able to tell them the reason SQL injection
    works is because many times the SQL calls you are making are
    mutable, and you have to use an API that produces an immutable SQL
    call, such as prepared statement. They're going to understand it
    that way, they will understand it, they do understand it, but you've
    got to put it in terms that are meaningful to the developers. That
    means if you are going to go out there and try to train those
    developers, you better understand their software.

Jim Manico

  -
    Ken, what would you recommend to the small business that is writing
    a lot of custom software, in a situation where they may not
    necessarily be able to afford a static analysis tool, but they still
    want to do some kind of code review process? What would you
    recommend?

Ken van Wyk

  -
    I would have to start by saying that I am a big believer in doing
    source code analysis, and I find that it is very frustrating that we
    don't have great solutions yet in the open source world for doing
    source code analysis. You have some of the early research projects
    like ITS4 that Gary McGraw talked about a few days ago on the
    podcast, but those are not business tools. They are research
    projects, so my first statement is take a look at some of those
    source code analysis tools. I understand that a lot of them are
    pretty expensive, however, they are good stuff. If you still just
    cannot do that, there are a couple of things that are useful to do.
    One is, I'm a big believer in not just looking for problems in code,
    but enforcing positive practices. Like, the ESAPI essentially is
    providing code patterns for doing secure things like output encoding
    and authentication and access control. If it is not ESAPI, provide
    your developers with methods and tools and software they can use
    that do those security related functions. Make sure that they are
    complying with those coding guidelines. Your coding guidelines have
    to be specific, and they have to be actual code. Secondly, it is not
    that difficult when you're doing design level review to prioritize
    where the high risk areas of the code are, things like
    authentication and things like encrypting sensitive data. Those
    surface pretty quickly if you are doing things like threat modeling
    or if you are doing something like the Cigital Architectural Risk
    Analysis. Take those highest risk portions of your code and do
    manual code review on those looking for compliance to those positive
    practices. You can accomplish code review then without a tool. I am
    not going to say that it is easy, and I still prefer to use a tool,
    but you can do pretty darnn good source code analysis manually. I
    just finished a Java project about a month ago where we did exactly
    that. We took a look at this Java business code and prioritized down
    to about ten percent of the highest risk portions of the code, and
    we did code review on those without tools. It worked very
    effectively. Then, we went and tested the scenarios that we came up
    with in the source code review. We went and tested those and
    verified that the problems we found were in fact problems.

Jim Manico

  -
    Ken, your book Secure Coding: Principles and Practices, it was
    actually one of the first books that I read in my pursuit of
    application security. Would you care to tell us what prompted you to
    write the book, how difficult the process was, and what came out of
    that process?

Ken van Wyk

  -
    Well, the secure coding book that Mark Graff and I did was
    published, first of all, in 2003 by O’Reilly. We are very grateful
    to them for the support that we got on that. It really came out of a
    project that Mark had done with us when I worked together with him
    at Para-Protect years ago where he did a review of the software
    security space. This was circa 2000 or 1999 even. It was several
    years back. From that, Mark had put together a white paper that we
    had made available to several of our customers. We decided to turn
    that into a book. Mark got that project started, and then he asked
    me a little bit later if I was willing to help coauthor it, so very
    pragmatically, that is how I got into it. In fact, I was on vacation
    in Hawaii when it happened. He called me one day and said can you
    help out with this project? I said I would be happy to. Now to
    answer your question of what came out of that…Even though, as I said
    earlier, I have software in my background many years back
    academically, and while I was working in the first few years of my
    career, I did quite a bit of software development, I am not a
    software guy, so when Mark first asked if I was willing to take on
    this project, it was quite intimidating to me to be very honest. I
    wanted to do it and felt that it was important for all of those
    reasons that I said earlier on the podcast, so I said alright, let’s
    do it. It took me a tremendous amount of effort to dive into trying
    to understand the problem space better before I felt that I could
    speak to it in an intelligent sort of way. I would say that since
    then, that was 2003 and now it is 2009, the ball has moved down the
    field significantly. A lot of things that I am very aware of now,
    like Microsoft’s SDL and the Cigital Touchpoints stuff in my mind,
    or at least from what we could find, those things did not exist when
    we were working on our book project, even though they might have
    been in their formation cycles at that point. I think that when I
    look at that problem space now, the solutions are a whole lot
    different from what we wrote about back then. I am grateful that I
    had that opportunity. It was a lot of fun to work on the project.

Jim Manico

  -
    So, I hear you are working on a new book now. What problem space are
    you planning on addressing?

Ken van Wyk

  -
    First of all, I should plug my publisher here. We are working with
    Addison-Wesley on this one. It is Mark Graff and I that are teaming
    up on it again. Mark and I love the collaborative work that we have
    been able to do together over the years. One of the big problems I
    have seen in trying to get into this space in the last several years
    is that I often see software development environments where we have
    the software developers and we have the security team. It is very
    much of an adversarial sort of relationship in a lot of shops. Now
    there are some companies that are really leading the charge in
    making those two groups work better together. Those are the
    exception and not the rule, so the book that we are currently
    working on, the project name for it is Confluence. We are really
    trying to encourage infosec people and software people to
    collaborate more effectively together, so we are looking at things
    like the Microsoft SDL and the Cigital ARA. We are stepping through
    in a very practical way. Here are the things that you can do, and
    more importantly, here is how you can work with the security team
    and security guys, here is how you can work with the software
    developers to make this work better. A lot of times I see software
    developers, as I said earlier, tend to focus on functional
    specification where security people tend to look at things and think
    of how things can break, but do not really understand how the
    software works necessarily. To me, there is a complimentary
    relationship between those two. It is just a matter of trying to
    figure out how to get them together and play nicely rather than just
    throw stones at each other all day. That is one of the main outcomes
    that we are shooting for in the book, is to help software and
    security people work nicely together.

Jim Manico

  -
    Ken, what would you recommend in a situation where a company is
    depending on a third party product and they need to reduce risk, but
    they do not have a copy of the source code?

Ken van Wyk

  -
    Well, you can start by reading the OWASP project that was done last
    year on the summer of code. Stephen Craig Evans I think was the
    author who did this on securing WebGoat using ModSecurity in Apache.
    That is probably an extreme example of something like a web app
    firewall. One of the underlying things that he tried to tackle in
    that project was to take this thing that is inherently insecure,
    WebGoat is intended to be insecure, and see if he could secure it
    with ModSecurity without hanging a single line of code in WebGoat.
    Essentially, he emulated that he had no access to the source code.
    By gosh, if you can secure something as insecure as WebGoat without
    access to the source code, you ought to be able to secure pretty
    darnn much anything, so I thought that was a really fascinating
    project from that standpoint. More to your question, I think if you
    have software that you absolutely rely on and depend on and do not
    have access to the source code…Let’s face it, that happens all of
    the time. What can you do about it? The traditional IT security
    mentality would tell you to put firewalls all around it and put web
    app firewalls all around it. There is value to some of that. I am
    not a huge believer in web app firewalls as I said earlier. However,
    in a circumstance where you do not have access to the source code,
    that is one of the cases where web app firewalls can provide some
    real value. If you are willing to spend the time to define for the
    web app firewall all the interfaces of that software and allow that
    web app firewall to essentially do positive input validation for all
    of the IO of that application, that means that you cannot just
    deploy the web app firewall and watch out for the OWASP top ten
    mode. It just cannot sit there and look for a list of bad things,
    because then it is fundamentally an antivirus type methodology,
    which is doomed to failure, so I think that part of that problem can
    be solved with things like web app firewalls if you deploy them
    carefully. Part of it can be solved by really carefully
    compartmentalizing the environment where you are placing this stuff.
    If you have third party code, let us look at things right down to
    the Java security manager. If it is a J2EE module, let us put some
    sandboxing around it using the security manager. It is not a perfect
    solution at all and such, so we want to combine several things
    together. I would look at ways of defining and then securing the
    boundary layers where we have connections to and from other
    software. Let us make sure that we are properly doing input
    validation across them. A web app firewall can certainly be a piece
    of that.

Jim Manico

  -
    Ken, would you care to look into the future for us? What do you
    think is going to be on the OWASP top ten in 2018?

Ken van Wyk

  -
    Well, I listened to Andrew van der Stock’s answer to that, and I
    tend to at least partially agree with his somewhat pessimistic
    outlook. I think that we are going to be seeing things like
    cross-site scripting for a long time. Before I dive into an answer
    on that, let me just take you back in history a little bit, because
    I think that if we explore our history a little bit, we will have a
    better understanding of what the future will look like. In 1988, the
    Morris internet worm…I was working at Lehigh University up in
    Pennsylvania when that hit the Internet. Shortly after that, I went
    to work at CERT at Carnegie Mellon. When that hit the Internet, it
    was a really big deal. I went out and I studied everything I could
    learn about this. A few months after the attack, there was an issue
    of the communications of the ACM Journal where they analyzed the
    worm code and really described how this thing worked. That was the
    first time I learned about buffer overflows. That particular journal
    was published in May of 1989. I looked at that and studied it, and I
    read about buffer overflows. I found it to be fascinating how Morris
    was able to use a hole in the Berkley finger daemon to get some code
    to run on another machine across the Internet. I looked at that and
    read the articles, and I thought great, we are done with buffer
    overflows because this is published. We all understand it now. We
    can move on and come up with new problems, right? Obviously, that
    did not turn out to be the case. We saw buffer overflows for many
    years, and in fact, if you go out to CVE, you will find that buffer
    overflows are still being written today, 20 plus years later, so
    that is why I tend to agree with Andrew’s statement that I think we
    are going to be seeing the likes of cross-site scripting for a long
    time. I think that things like cross-site request forgery are a
    little bit less understood. I would like to think that SQL injection
    will die away, because that is a pretty simple change to make in
    most code, to use an API like prepared statement, so I would like to
    think that the number two on the list right now is going to die
    away, so now I am trying to extrapolate out into the future a little
    bit. As I said, I think that cross-site scripting is going to be
    with us for a long time. I think that some of the unexplored space
    in the vulnerability world has to do with timing. We see if you look
    even at some of the WebGoat exercises on concurrency, there is a lot
    of subtlety in what happens in concurrency and scoping of variables
    and things like that in Java code, where unexpected things can
    happen in a Java Servlet let’s say, just because you are being hit
    by two instantiations of the same Servlet simultaneously…We do not
    yet have our heads around that problem enough to really understand
    the ramifications of timing problems and concurrency problems in
    massively parallel micro processing environments. I think that we
    are going to start to see problems come up in timing of code that
    people have just barely explored. You can look back to Matt Bishop
    and Mike Dilger’s work on time of check, time of use problems years
    ago. We have race conditions like that and UNIX for many years. I
    think in terms of micro or multithreaded environments like on
    massively parallel Java and C Sharp for that matter deployments, I
    think that there are timing issues there that we don't yet
    understand and people have not really began to poke at very much, so
    if I were to kind of look into that crystal ball and think what is
    going to happen down the road, it would not surprise me at all to
    see timing related problems start to pop up in a much bigger way
    than what we have seen so far, that and some of the problems that we
    currently see. I think that cross-site scripting is probably the
    biggest one that we have in front of us right now to deal with. We
    do not seem to be doing a very effective job at getting rid of that
    just yet.

Jim Manico

  -
    Ken, there is definitely a trend in the application security world
    where new exploits or new attack techniques will get a lot more
    press and attention than new defensive techniques or defensive
    information in general. Do you have any thoughts on the whole
    builder versus breaker debate?

Ken van Wyk

  -
    Yeah, I think that first of all that breaking stuff is certainly
    more sexy, if you will, so the media tends to gravitate to that and
    you get more readership when you say, hey, I have figured out how to
    break something or other, a lot more interest than I have figured
    out how to build things securely. There is that natural symbiotic
    relationship also, I suppose, between the builders and the breakers.
    Having spent a lot of time on both sides of that issue, I would have
    to say that we need to continue talking about how to build things
    securely. I like what Gary said also. His philosophy is stick to
    your message and keep repeating yourself. It is important. We have
    got to be telling people how to build things securely. At the same
    time, I find that people really internalize a problem when you show
    them how it breaks, so when I get in front of developers, for
    example, and I try to help them figure out the problem space. I will
    use tools like WebGoat to help them internalize the problem and then
    turn that around and say okay, we have just seen something like
    forced browsing, which is fundamentally an access control problem.
    You have seen how it breaks. Now let us talk about how we can fix
    that. You can get that messaging in there even using a tool that
    teaches you how to break things, so I think it is really a question
    of how we properly position those messages so that people can
    internalize the problem and still get the message out about what the
    solution is.

Jim Manico

  -
    Ken, I see that you have a timeshare here on my island here on
    Kauai, so may I ask what your favorite place to eat and drink on the
    island is because next time you are here I am buying.

Ken van Wyk

  -
    Well, first of all, I kind of object to you calling it your island.
    I have always thought of it as my island ever since my wife and I
    honeymooned there in 1989. Seriously, there are several places that
    I like on the island. If you like Italian food, Dondero’s over at
    the Hyatt at Poipu is fantastically good. It is not cheap, but it is
    fantastically good. My favorite casual place on the island I would
    have to say is the Waimea Brewing Company. They make some really
    nice ales. The quality kind of goes up and down over time that I
    have been going there, but you just can't beat it for the ambiance.
    Go there in the late afternoon and have some of their mango barbeque
    ribs and a nice glass of ale and sit back and enjoy the breezes.
    That is why we enjoy going back to Kauai so much.

Jim Manico

  -
    Well, I look forward to meeting you next time you are on the island,
    Ken.

Ken van Wyk

  -
    I look forward to it too, Jim.

Jim Manico

  -
    I am sure you do, sir.

Ken van Wyk

  -
    I only go back there every two years. Man, I wish I could go there
    every year. I land at Lihue Airport, and you can feel the blood
    pressure go down and everything seems right in the world.

Jim Manico

  -
    Well, Ken, next time you are flying into Kauai, let me know, and I
    will be there at the airport ready to start an application security
    conversation with you the moment you hit ground.

Ken van Wyk

  -
    Yeah, right. That will help the stress level go down.

Jim Manico

  -
    Well, Ken I really appreciate you taking the time to interview with
    us today. Do you have any final thoughts before we finish up?

Ken van Wyk

  -
    Yeah, I would say that in the software or application security space
    we have a lot of challenges. We have got a lot of work to do. I love
    what OWASP is doing. It is some valuable stuff that you guys are
    putting out to the community and for free. I applaud that. We have a
    lot more work to do. Gary was talking about a maturity model. When
    people first mentioned that to me a few months ago, I immediately
    pushed back and said wait, wait, wait, we are nowhere near ready for
    a maturity model yet in my view. I think that this community has to
    mature a lot more. When I think of a maturity model, I think of
    engineering and I think of decades or centuries old practices like
    designing bridges and things like that. We are nowhere near that in
    software engineering. We still need to learn from our mistakes for a
    lot longer. I think that initiatives like that are forward thinking
    and very useful. I also recognize, like I said, that we have a long
    way to go, so kind of my parting words are that we all have to keep
    slogging at this stuff guys. It is a lot of work. We do not
    understand all of the problem space yet. We should not fool
    ourselves into thinking that we do, so let us keep pounding at the
    problem and trying to convince the decision makers to pay attention
    to it. It is not just as simple as putting firewalls in front of our
    stuff to make it secure. It is a much bigger problem than that. Hope
    that we do not see a lot of real nasty disasters in the press,
    because even though that gets us the attention, it is the wrong kind
    of attention. The responses we see to big problems and big
    intrusions are not necessarily good. They are knee jerk reactions
    and not the sort of long term responses that we need strategically
    for this community to grow in a positive way.

    Richard is the founder of the free software movement, GNU Project
    and the Free Software Foundation. Richard is also a renowned hacker
    whose major accomplishments include GNU Emacs, the GNU C compiler,
    and the GNU debugger. He is also the author of the GNU General
    Public License, which is the most widely used free software license,
    which also pioneered the concept of Copyleft. Richard, can you start
    by taking us back in time to when you were at MIT and first began to
    feel that there was an ethical problem with proprietary software?

Richard Stallman

  -
    Well, first I should explain that what MIT did that was most
    important was teach me to appreciate free software, because when I
    worked at the AI lab, my job was to improve the free operating
    system that we used. I was not the only one doing this. I was part
    of a group which had previously developed the system, and we were
    making it better, so I got to experience a way of life in which
    people were free to share and change software. I had the experience,
    for instance, of meeting a cross assembler for the PDP-11, and I
    found one, but it was written to run on a different PDP time-sharing
    system, so it wouldn't run on our machine, so I had to adapt it so
    it would run, and I added more features to it, too. Then, somebody
    else wanted to borrow it and use it on a different PDP-10
    time-sharing system, so he got it from me, and he adapted it and
    added more features. Then, we merged the two versions back together
    so we would maintain all of the features. This is how people did
    things the natural cooperating way, but then during this period of
    the 1970s, free software was disappearing in most of the world. By
    the end of the 70s, almost all software was proprietary, but we were
    an island of freedom and cooperation within that world of unkindness
    and subjugation. Then, Xerox gave MIT a laser printer called the
    Dover. Although in some ways it was a nice printer, it frequently
    got paper jams. When it was jammed, it would stay jammed for quite a
    while, because nobody worked near the printer, so it might stay
    jammed for a while without anybody noticing it. As we got used to
    the idea that it would take a long time to print your job because it
    was probably jammed for a long time, we would just wait longer and
    longer before going to look for our jobs, except we would then find
    it jammed and then we would fix it. It was just ridiculous. Now with
    our previous printer, which also got jammed but was much slower, I
    had implemented a couple of features that helped us cope with the
    limitations of the physical printer itself. For instance, when it
    finished your print job, it would display a message on your screen
    saying your job is finished. Now, this is not easy, because it
    required cooperation between the PDP-11 that ran the printer and the
    PDP-10, but both of those were free software, and I was able to
    change them both. Then there was another feature. When the printer
    got jammed, ran out of paper, or had any trouble, it signaled the
    PDP-10, which would display a message on the screen of each person
    waiting for printing. Those were exactly the people who would have a
    strong motivation to go immediately and fix it. As a result, it
    still got jammed, but it didn't stay jammed for very long. When I
    saw that the new printer also had problems with jams, I wanted to
    implement the same feature, but I couldn't. The reason is because
    the program that ran the new printer was proprietary. We did not
    have a source code, and we could not change it at all. There was
    nothing to do but suffer. Then, sometime later, I was visiting
    Pittsburgh, and I had heard that somebody at Carnegie Mellon had a
    copy of that source code, so I went to his office and asked him to
    give me a copy, expecting that per the customs of our community he
    would share it with me, but he refused and said he had promised not
    to give me a copy. I was stunned. I didn't know what to say, so I
    just turned around and walked away. It rankled, so I kept thinking
    about it. I realized that he had betrayed us at MIT, according to
    the principles of our community. Then I realized that he had not
    just done that to us, he had done it to you also. In fact, he had
    done it to everybody, everyone in the world. He had betrayed the
    whole world. That reminded me of the evil emperor Cao Cao in a
    famous Chinese novel, which I had read in translation a couple of
    years before, whose most famous saying was 'I would rather betray
    the whole world than have the whole world betray me.' Whereas Cao
    Cao had only spoken of that possibility, that man had actually done
    it. This is what showed me that I was dealing with an ethical issue
    here. I had already learned to appreciate cooperation and sharing
    and to practice it. I had already realized that not sharing was not
    nice, but here I realized that by signing that nondisclosure
    agreement, he did wrong to me and to everyone else in the world he
    was promising not to share with.

Jim Manico

  -
    Richard, the OWASP community, although we are not purist in terms of
    free software, we do a lot that is in sync with free software
    philosophy. In particular, we release a great number of free tools
    and software for the community. Because of the nature of how open
    OWASP is, there are some rather famous folks in the industry who
    have called us a bunch of communists and hippies.

Richard Stallman

  -
    Well, they are showing what they want. What they want is to
    subjugate other people, and they are going to call you nasty names
    if you give people freedom, so take it as a badge of success. I do
    want to ask you to do something. It is very important not to steer
    people towards non-free software. I suspect that you are trying to
    serve a large community of users, some of whom do use non-free
    software or don't care about their own freedom and they are inclined
    to use non-free software. Well, you can't control what they do, but
    you do control what you do and what you say. I would like to ask you
    to please not, even if you recognize that some people are going to
    use non-free software, please don't grant legitimacy to that
    practice in what you say. In the GNU Project, many of our programs
    are designed to run on non-free systems, as well as free systems. A
    lot of our programs will run on Windows and Macintosh, for instance,
    which are both very nasty proprietary systems that have back doors.
    Microsoft can change the software in Windows any way it wishes at
    any time. Apple can change the software in Mac anyway it wishes at
    any time. You couldn't imagine a more gaping and dangerous back
    door, but we do not refuse to let our software run on those systems,
    and it seems to be overall a good thing that our software does run
    on them. It gives people a taste of freedom and then they may want
    more, so it is perfectly natural if you also want to distribute
    software that can run on a lot of platforms, including non-free
    ones, but what I hope you will not do is suggest that people install
    a non-free program. You can't stop them. It's not your
    responsibility to try and stop them, but you shouldn't encourage
    them.

Jim Manico

  -
    Richard, free software is distinct from open source, and a lot of
    authors get this wrong. Would you mind discussing for us the clear
    distinction and difference between free software and the open source
    movement?

Richard Stallman

  -
    Well, I first should explain what free software means. Free software
    means software that respects the person’s freedom and the social
    solidarity of the user's community, so it means that you have
    freedom as the user of the program, so it is free as in freedom. It
    does not mean zero price. We are not talking about gratis software.
    We are not saying that you should give copies away. What we are
    against is not selling. It is not a matter of price at all. Price is
    a side issue, a detail. It is an issue of respecting the user's
    freedom. There are four particular freedoms that are essential and
    that define free software, if you, the user, have these four
    freedoms. Freedom 0 is the freedom to run the program as you wish.
    Freedom 1 is to study the source code and change it to make the
    program do what you wish. Freedom 2 is the freedom to help your
    neighbor, which is the freedom to redistribute exact copies when you
    wish. Freedom 3 is the freedom to contribute to your community,
    which is the freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions,
    supposing you have made some, when you wish. With these four
    freedoms the users have control over the software, both individually
    and collectively, and they are free to cooperate, so the idea of the
    free software movement is that users deserve these freedoms. As a
    developer, it is your ethical imperative to respect these freedoms.
    As a user, you should reject any program that would deny you these
    freedoms for the sake of your own freedom. Also, if you are required
    to agree not to share the program, then you are doing wrong to
    others as well. Now, these are the ideas of the free software
    movement, which I founded in 1983 when I announced that I was going
    to do the GNU Operating System. The GNU Operating System was
    completed when Linux the colonel was released as free software in
    1992. Linux was first developed in 1991, but it was not free
    software in 1991. Its developer made it free in 1992 and at that
    point, it filled that last gap in the GNU system, which was already
    almost finished. Then we had a complete operating system, which is
    the GNU/Linux system. It started to catch on, so during the 90s,
    more and more people were using it. There was a political and
    philosophical disagreement within the community between those of us
    who said that freedom and cooperation are the most important things
    and people who said that they mainly wanted powerful, reliable,
    efficient software. Of course, both could use the same software and
    both could cooperate in developing the same programs, but these are
    two fundamentally different ideas of what it is all about, so by the
    mid-90s, this disagreement was very strong and in 1998, the people
    in the second group, those who did not see the difference between
    free and non-free software chose the term open source instead. By
    using a different term, they were able to leave out certain ideas of
    the free software movement by simply never mentioning it. That is
    what they did. They chose to present the matter as purely one of
    practical convenience and not to say anything more important than
    practical convenience is at stake, so that's the big disagreement at
    the lowest level. It's a disagreement about values.

Jim Manico

  -
    Can you live with the term FOSS, Free Open Source Software?

Richard Stallman

  -
    I would rather we use the term FLOSS, which is Free/Libre Open
    Source Software. The reason I prefer it is that it gives sort of
    equal weight to the Free/Libre and the open source, so it is fairer
    to us, but basically those two terms represent an attempt to cite
    both of these two philosophical camps. Now,sometimes that is a
    sensible thing to do. For instance, there are people who are
    studying the practices of development teams. They are not concerned
    with the question of why do you do this and what are the values, so
    for them to use this term such as FLOSS and mention both camps
    without taking a side, it makes sense in what they are doing. I do
    not object to that, butI do not talk about what I am doing as FLOSS
    or FOSS. I say that I am an activist in the free software movement
    because what I want is freedom, not just mine, but yours as well.

Jim Manico

  -
    I think one place where the rubber hits the road in that area is the
    difference between GPL and LGPL. Can you talk to us about LGPL, and
    when is the only appropriate time to use it and still be in line?

Richard Stallman

  -
    Well, actually I better start by talking about the GNU general
    public license or GPL, because that is what we would contrast the
    LGPL with. The GNU GPL is the license that I wrote. It is a free
    software license, but it is not the only one. There are many free
    software licenses. Any license that gives you the four freedoms is a
    free software license, but I wrote the GNU GPL to try to do more
    than that. I wanted to do the most I possibly could to establish
    freedom for all computer users. Particularly, when I wrote a program
    and made it free, I wanted to make sure that every user who got the
    program would get the four freedoms. Now, there are other free
    license distributors, for instance the X11 license and the two BSD
    licenses, which permit non-free modified versions. That means that
    person A can release a free program and person B gets a copy with
    the four freedoms and then either modifies it or just compiles it
    and distributes copies as proprietary software, so if person C gets
    a copy of that, then person C does not have the four freedoms. Now I
    looked at that. I have seen that happen already. I realized that for
    the goals of the free software movement, that would be failure
    because we would make a nice program that person B would get the
    benefit of freedom, but then person C, D, E and maybe a million
    people would not get freedom. Thus, we would mostly have failed, so
    I designed a license to prevent that from happening. The GNU GPL
    says yes you are free to redistribute exact copies or redistribute
    modified versions, but when you do, you must respect the freedom of
    the people you redistribute to. You have to pass the freedom on to
    them as well. Thus, we make sure that everybody who gets any version
    of the program gets freedom also, so that is what is special about
    the GNU GPL. It is called Copyleft. Legally, it is implemented using
    copyright law because copyright law exists, but it uses copyright
    law to achieve a rather unusual purpose, which is not what it is
    typically used for.

Jim Manico

  -
    So you are using copyright law to subvert copyright law?

Richard Stallman

  -
    Well, yes and no. Remember that there are many different methods
    that are used to make a method proprietary. Copyright is one of
    them, but contracts are also used. I am sure you have heard of user
    license agreements. Those are contracts and they are also being used
    to make software proprietary. Another method is simply not releasing
    the source code. Now if the users do not have the source code, they
    might have Freedoms 0 and 2 to run the program and redistribute
    exact copies, but they do not have Freedom 1 to study and change the
    source code, which means that it is almost impossible for them to
    make modified versions, so they do not have Freedom 3, which is the
    freedom to redistribute those modified versions, so I have to try to
    prevent all of these methods of making a program proprietary. The
    only thing I could use to do it was copyright law. Nowadays, there
    is another method of making programs non-free, and that is
    tivoization, which is the practice of delivering a program
    preinstalled in a device and building a device so that if a user
    installs a modified program, the device refuses to run it at all.
    This is a way of practically speaking, eliminating Freedom number 1.
    In any case, I developed the GNU GPL to make sure all of the users
    would have these freedoms, but then a few years later, the free
    software foundation was developing the GNU C library at the end of
    the 80s. I had to think about how to release it. I realized that if
    we released the GNU C library under the GNU GPL, then you would only
    be allowed to link it into free programs. The result would be that
    non-free programs just would not run on the GNU System at all. It
    would be illegal to link them to the GNU System. It occurred to me
    that if we pushed against that particular wall, the main effect
    would be to push us backward rather than push the wall back, so I
    decided as a tactical decision to give permission to link the GNU C
    library into proprietary programs, not that those proprietary
    programs are ethically legitimate, but the conclusion was it would
    be self-defeating to try to prohibit them from being run on top of
    the GNU C library. Not only that, but there are free programs under
    other licenses, and if you were running them on the GNU System, you
    would need to link them with the GNU C library also, so this is why
    I made the decision to write and use the GNU LGPL, which is now
    called the GNU Lesser GPL, but originally it was called the GNU
    Library GPL. I changed the name when I realized that the old name
    was giving people the wrong idea. They saw a library GPL…Well, I am
    writing a library. That means I should use this license. I do not
    think that you should always use the lesser GPL for every library.
    You should make a tactical decision, because it is goods. Sometimes
    it is better if the library is under the ordinary GPL and is only
    available for use in free programs. That gives free programs an
    advantage, and I need every advantage I can get, but then there are
    some certain circumstances where it is tactically better to release
    something under a permissive license. For instance, one of the big
    battles that we are fighting is to convince society to invite OG
    formats, which are non-patented formats for audio and video. Most of
    the formats typically used are patented and in many cases secret,
    which is a big problem for free software. Well, if we want people to
    distribute in OG formats their audio and video, we want to make it
    as easy as possible for people to play those formats. That means
    that we want to encourage everybody that is making a player to
    install the support for OG, which means we better take away any
    obstacles. The player code was originally released under the GNU
    GPL, and someone suggested to the developers that it would better to
    switch to a simple permissive license, and I agreed that was a good
    idea for tactical reasons, so in fact the choice between GPL or LGPL
    or a lax permissive license, like the X11 license. This is not the
    same thing as choosing between free software and open source. All
    those licenses are free software licenses, and they are all also
    open source licenses, so the difference between free software and
    open source is a matter of your values.

Jim Manico

  -
    Richard, those of us in the web world are huge users of Apache
    software, and I saw that the Apache 2.0 License and GPL3 are
    compatible.

Richard Stallman

  -
    Yeah, I worked on that. It was not exactly easy, but we managed to
    implement that compatibility, and the reason is that it is
    practically convenient to merge code from a GPL covered program and
    an Apache license covered program, so now if the first program is
    under GPL Version 3 or if it is GPL Version 2 or later, which allows
    you to use it under GPL Version 3, then you can merge them.

Jim Manico

  -
    On a similar note, I used the jQuery JavaScript Library quite
    extensively in my own projects, and this is licensed with both GPL2
    and the original MIT license. How can I build rich JavaScript
    functionality into my JavaScript applications without being pressed
    or pressing my users into it?

Richard Stallman

  -
    Well, let me explain. First of all, that combination of licenses is
    a little bit silly. When you say MIT license, I think you mean the
    X11 license. Now,that is a totally permissive license. In fact, that
    is so permissive that you could just put that in a GPL covered
    program, so they do not need to release it under the GPL because
    they already went further than that by releasing it under the X11
    license. There is no problem. It is just that they could have
    presented things a little bit more simply and got the same result.
    In any case, there is no reason why you should not use that program.
    It is free software. I have never written even one line of
    JavaScript, so I cannot give you any specific recommendations, but I
    can warn you that a lot of websites distribute non-free JavaScript
    programs to their users. Because it gets downloaded silently into
    the browser, you do not even know if it is happening. As I see it,
    getting a non-free JavaScript program loaded into your browser is
    just as bad as having a non-free C program installed through your
    package manager. The main difference is that you would notice the
    installation of a package through your package manager. Programs are
    not normally doing that. Typically you have to be rude to install a
    package and most of your programs do not run as root, so nobody
    tries to just quietly on the sly install packages, but they do write
    websites to send you JavaScript programs that get silently installed
    into your machine, so we need to make sure our freedom is respected
    there also. Part of that is just that the source code of the
    JavaScript programs need to be available and released under a free
    software license, but there is another issue too. Suppose somebody
    releases a free JavaScript program, and you decide to change it and
    decide you want to use your version. Well, you need to be able to
    make sure to run your version instead of what comes in the webpage,
    so we need browser features that allow you to say, when I visit such
    and such page and it comes with this JavaScript program, do not run
    it, run this other program instead, or patch it in this way and run
    the patched version. Greasemonkey almost does it, but not quite. The
    reason it falls short is that it does not guarantee to patch the
    JavaScript before it gets to run, so the script that is in the page
    will actually run before Greasemonkey gets a chance to do anything,
    but something sort of similar which did not have that particular
    problem would do the job.

Jim Manico

  -
    Richard, could you take the basic concepts of free software and
    apply them to other works, such as music or books?

Richard Stallman

  -
    It seems to me that we should divide books into three broad
    categories based on what kind of contribution they make to society.
    They first category is the works of practical use, the works that
    you use to do a job. The second category is works whose contribution
    to society is to say what certain people think. The third category
    is works of art and entertainment, whose contribution to society is
    in what it feels like to enjoy the work and the impact of the work,
    so these are three different ways of contributing and each one leads
    me to different conclusions about what freedom we must have in using
    these works. The first category, the works that you use to do a job,
    would include software programs, recipes for cooking, educational
    works, reference works, text fonts, and various other things that
    you could think of. I believe that those all must be free. The same
    four freedoms apply because you are using those works to do a job
    and that means that you need to be in control of the work. You need
    to be free to change it to do the job that you want to do and do it
    the way you want. Once you change it, you need to be free to publish
    your version so the other people whose needs are like yours can get
    the benefit of what you have done. It turns out that it is absurd to
    try to forbid redistribution of exact copies when you permit
    distribution of modified version, so my conclusion is that these
    works have to be free. I do not reach the same conclusion about the
    other categories. For instance, category two is the works whose
    contribution is to say what certain people think. To publish a
    modified version of that is to misrepresent those people and that is
    not a contribution. That is not useful, so there is no reason to
    insist that people be free to do that. Thus, I suggest a reduced
    copyright system, which is mostly the same as the present one with
    one difference. Everybody must be free to non-commercially
    redistribute exact copies. In other words, we must have the freedom
    to share, so I do not say that these works have to be free, but I do
    say they must be sharable, which is a weaker criterion. It does not
    mean that you get the full four freedoms. It means that you get
    Freedom 0, the freedom to use the work yourself as you wish, and
    part of Freedom 2. That is the non-commercial part of Freedom 2,
    because Freedom 2 is the freedom to redistribute exact copies, and
    that could mean commercially or non-commercially. For these works, I
    think non-commercial distribution is freedom enough. Now this
    freedom, this minimum freedom to non-commercially share, is the
    freedom we must all have for published works, because the only way
    to take this away from people, given that people find sharing so
    useful and so important, is with absurd, cruel, Draconian laws. What
    we see the RIAA doing and similar efforts in many other countries is
    the war on sharing, and it is evil. We must legalize sharing, but
    that does not mean going all the way to giving the four freedoms. I
    don't think those are necessary for these works whose purpose is to
    say what certain people think. The last category is works of art and
    entertainment. For these, modification can be useful, because a
    modified version of a work of art can be a contribution to art. In
    fact, apropo of this, I was just watching Sita Sings the Blues,
    which is an interesting example of reusing songs that were sung a
    few decades ago. It is a very good way of reusing them, so I think
    that people must be free to do that, but they don't have to be able
    to do that immediately, so I propose that copyrights should last for
    ten years and during those ten years, everybody should be free to
    non-commercially share, because that minimum freedom must be there
    for any published work. Anything else could require, such as
    commercial use or modification, would require permission. Then,
    after ten years, the copyright should expire and then people should
    be free to reuse that in other works of art and so on.

Jim Manico

  -
    Richard, I recently bootlegged a copy of Revolution OS for my
    personal use only in compatibility with their license, and I see
    that you talked about stories early on in your career where you were
    trying to encourage users of a system to have a blank password, and
    those who didn't, you encouraged to change their password to a blank
    password. From OWASP perspective, we think a lack of a password
    policy is a major critical vulnerability. Would you care to talk to
    us about the relation of free software and security and web
    application security in any way, sir?

Richard Stallman

  -
    Well, they are not the same issue, and so the relationships are
    indirect. I'm not sure how many of you have experienced what it is
    like to do your work on a shared computer with security. It is
    basically living in a police state. You see, the administrators must
    maintain control, so they make the rule that anything that threatens
    our control, anything that looks like it is trying to escape from
    our control means you are subversive, and we will punish you. It is
    the same path that any other tyranny follows. The administrators can
    watch what you do. You can't watch what they do. They control you,
    you can't control them. It is nasty. Well, I had the good fortune to
    experience using a shared computer without security. There was no
    security on the incompatible time sharing system in the 1970s. What
    we did to keep the system working okay was we all looked around and
    we had a society, so what mostly kept people from destroying things
    of each other was that we were part of a community, and we all did
    not want to destroy things for each other. Now once in a while
    somebody would show up from the net who was inclined to make
    trouble, usually just because he wanted attention or was feeling
    miserable or something, but what happened was that when they saw
    that it wasn't hard, that there was no challenge to it, most of them
    would decide it was not fun anymore, because anybody could give the
    command to tell the system to shut down in five minutes, but
    somebody else could cancel the shutdown. People could not believe
    that they could really give this command, but they could. Once they
    gave the command and saw that they really could do it, somebody else
    who was using the machine and didn't want it to shut down would
    cancel the shut down. Then they did not have to do it anymore, so I
    experienced what it was like in a computer where the way we solved
    the same problem was not by maintaining rigid police control over
    everybody, but instead by integrating them into society, so that
    they became decent members of society and didn't damage other
    people. It happened regularly. In fact, I know of at least one
    person who is a professor at MIT now, but his first connection with
    us was as a tourist, basically logging in on our computers over the
    net with no other connection with us, but we didn't have any
    passwords, so there was nothing to stop people from doing that.
    Well, one of the several labs that was running the incompatible
    time-sharing system decided to put in passwords from sheer
    orneriness as far as I can tell, because they didn't actually need
    them anymore than we did, but they did, and I found that so
    ludicrous that I studied their password encrypting code, and I
    worked out how to decrypt the passwords. In fact, I wrote a list
    program to do it, so I just looked at everybody’s password and
    decrypted it, and then I sent them a message saying I see you chose
    the password such and such. Why do not you join me in having a null
    password? That would support the principle that there should not be
    passwords. Of course, when a person got this message, he realized
    that there was really no security anyway and that the whole thing
    was silly, so I got one fifth of the users to use the null string as
    their password. They were doing it, all of them, as aware of the
    meaning, which was rejection of the idea of having passwords on the
    machine. Now, it is somewhat different with a personal computer. It
    is not common nowadays to have lots of people sharing one big
    computer, because nowadays it is so easy to get…well actually it is
    a much more powerful computer, but everybody has his own. That
    computer was much less powerful than any machine you could buy to
    actually use as a computer today. It had I think two megabytes of
    memory for us to share at its maximum extension, so you can see what
    I mean, but back then computers were so expensive that the AI lab
    could only afford to have one, and we all had to share it, and there
    were two choices for how we could get along with each other. One was
    to have a policeman standing around with their guns watching
    everything, ready to shoot you if they saw you doing anything that
    looked like they were trying to escape from their control. The other
    was to say let's get to know each other, let's be a community, let's
    treat each other decently because we want to treat each other
    decently and not because there is a cop watching every minute. This
    is a fight for freedom. I would like to suggest that people take a
    look at GNU.org for more information about GNU and the free software
    movement. Also, take a look at FSF.org. At FSF.org, you can find the
    resource pages which tell you about almost 6000 useful free software
    packages that run on GNU/Linux. Also, they tell you hardware the
    works with free software and recommended configurations and other
    such things, so if you want to live in freedom, that information
    will help you do it. You can also through FSF.org join the free
    software foundation. I am a full-time volunteer. The FSF does not
    pay me, but it has other staff that are supported mainly through
    members dues.

    I think we got it. I think we are done, Richard.

Richard Stallman

  -
    Well, thank you, sir. It has been a pleasure.

    This is absolutely fantastic. I want to reiterate that I am only
    going to release in the OGG format.

Richard Stallman

    By releasing also in OGG formats, you take away the pressure for
    people to use the patented MP3 format. A priori, I've got nothing
    against MP3, the problem is…in fact, there even is free software to
    play MP3, and there is free software to generate MP3, but some
    distributors are afraid to include it in their GNU/Linux systems
    because it is patented, and they are afraid that they will get sued,
    so we need to stop using it, so if you release also in OGG formats,
    at least that means you are not discouraging the OGG format.

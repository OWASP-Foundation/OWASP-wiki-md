Update

The OWASP Top 10 for Java EE is in a final draft. I need to add input
from Jeff his Esapi interfaces to the document and I'm waiting for some
additional reviews. A lot of work has been devoted already to the
document so I think that this will be the only deliverable for the SpoC
project. I will create a request for additional deliverables in the
Winter of Code projects.

<p>Modern applications often use APIs, microservices and containerization to deliver faster and better products and services.   There has been a massive migration away from monolithic web applications to this new, highly scalable architecture.  However, there are currently few training grounds for security testing in these areas. In comes DevSlop, OWASP's newest project, a collection of DevOps-driven applications, specifically designed to showcase security catastrophes and vulnerabilities for use in security testing, software testing, learning and teaching for both developers and security professionals.</p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>DevSlop's <strong>Pixi</strong>, the first of many applications to come for this OWASP project, is currently publicly available for your hacking and learning pleasure. Pixi is available in several docker containers and consists of a vulnerable web app and API service.  The intent is to teach users how to test modern web applications and API's for security issues and how to write more secure API's in the future.<img src="Pixi_logo.png" title="fig:Pixi_logo.png" alt="Pixi_logo.png" /></p>

## How can I participate in your project?

All you have to do is make the Project Leader's aware of your available
time to contribute to the project. It is also important to let the
Leader's know how you would like to contribute and pitch in to help the
project meet it's goals and milestones. There are many different ways
you can contribute to an OWASP Project, but communication with the leads
is key.

## If I am not a programmer can I participate in your project?

Yes, you can certainly participate in the project if you are not a
programmer or technical. The project needs different skills and
expertise and different times during its development. Currently, we are
looking for people to give us ideas for new components and problems to
add, as well as people to help code them. See the Road Map and Getting
Involved tab for more details.

# Road Map and Getting Involved

## Roadmap

As of March 2018:

  - Add new team members
  - Each add our own components to our new repo
  - Get ready for Open Security Summit
  - Release and document all work done at the Open Security Summit

As of <strong>September 2017, the highest priorities for the next 12
months</strong> are:

Each DevSlop component will have it's own roadmap.

**DevSlop Project Roadmap:**

  - Finish completing this Wiki page and get it reviewed/approved
  - Move all Pixi code into OWASP GitHub
  - Promote Project (interviews, speaking engagements, articles, etc)
  - Document Project
  - Create Issue Tracker
  - Follow Pixi Roadmap
  - Accept ideas for future components
  - Create HTTP 2.0 app as Component \#2
  - Create more DevOps apps

**Pixi Roadmap (First DevSlop Component):**

  - Document all the vulnerabilities
  - Multi language support
  - Finish CTF mode

## Getting Involved

Involvement in the development and promotion of **DevSlop** is actively
encouraged\! You do not have to be a security expert or a programmer to
contribute. Some of the ways you can help are as follows:

### Ideas

We need to know where to go next with this project. Have you seen an IT
tragedy recently? Tell us about it\! The more modern and 'different' the
better\!

### Coding

We could implement some of the later items on the roadmap sooner if
someone wanted to help out with coding it. Someone like you.

### Localization

Are you fluent in another language? Can you help translate the text
strings in the <strong>DevSlop Project</strong> into that language?
Pretty please?

### Feedback

Please email us to give us feedback: firstname.lastname@owasp.org
(Nicole Becher and Tanya Janca)

  - What do like?
  - What don't you like?
  - What features would you like to see prioritized on the roadmap?

# Minimum Viable Product

The DevSlop Project must provide documentation (in form of videos, blog
posts, interviews, within the app, or anything else) to teach users how
to use it. Without any information it's hard to know if the users are
learning all of the lessons that they need to. It would also be ideal if
Pixi and other future components were translated into different
languages.

# Project About

The OWASP DevSlop project is intended as place for people to learn about
new, modern and different web related application security issues. It is
a vulnerable series of systems, open to the public to download and play
with. The first instalment is called Pixi and is available now. More
pieces will be released as they are available, as well as training and
other learning aids. __NOTOC__ <headertabs></headertabs>

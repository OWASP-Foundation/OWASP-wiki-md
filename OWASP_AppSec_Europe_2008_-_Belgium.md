## Tutorial Days - May 19-20

OWASP arranged for several Application Security tutorials on May
19th-20th, the days prior to the conference.

<td><p>Most developers, IT professionals, and auditors learn what they know about application security on the job, usually by making mistakes. Application security is just not a part of many computer science curricula today and most organizations have not focused on instituting a culture that includes application security as a core part of their IT security efforts. This powerful two day course focuses on the most common web application security problems, including the OWASP Top Ten. The course will introduce and demonstrate hacking techniques, illustrating how application vulnerabilities can be exploited so students really understand how to avoid introducing such vulnerabilities into their code.</p>

## Evening Social Event - May 21

At every conference we have an evening social event the first night.
This allows participants to have some unstructured time to mingle with
the other attendees. They are always fun and typically attract about
half the conference attendees. This year's event will be a Flemish
buffet with special Belgian beers at the Monasterium (near the
conference location).

    at a rate of €199 per night. This room block is being held through
    April 11\!\! After that date, there is no guarantee that rooms at
    this rate will be available at the NH Gent Belfort.
  - OWASP attendees have an option for 20 rooms at € 122 and 10 rooms at
    € 132 per night at the [Hotel Monasterium
    PoortAckere](http://www.monasterium.be) up until April 30. Use OWASP

It is difficult getting rooms at reduced prices, as there is a medical
congress around the same time in Ghent. You will find it difficult to
get a room for the night of May 22. We recommend you then book a room
for one night near the airport of
[Brussels](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=hotels+zaventem,+belgium&ie=UTF8&z=11).

## Transportation to the Conference

If you are flying in you'll come through [Brussels
Airport](http://www.brusselsairport.be). From there it is 65 km to
Ghent. The airport train station is located below the terminal (basement
level-1). Up to 4 trains an hour connect the airport to Brussels North,
Brussels Central and Brussels Midi stations. The easiest way is then to
take the train to Ghent Sint-Pieters (directly or through Brussels).

To travel by train to the conferene come through Gent Sint-Pieters, see
the [Belgian Railways Website](http://www.b-rail.be/main/E/).

**Next Tuesday May 20th, the Belgian railway is on strike\!** If you are
flying in towards Brussels Airport, There will be long queues for the
taxis. I advise to contact airport transport beforehand to reserve a
place upfront. Possible services to and from Ghent are:

  - <http://www.taxi2airport.be/>
  - <http://www.palitax.be/>
  - <http://www.taxi-eurojet.be/>

If you are travelling with HST like Eurostar or Thalys: check with them
it they will ride.

From Ghent Sint-Pieters station tram nr 1 (direction Evergem Brielken)
is the quickest and most comfortable way to travel to the city centre
(stop KORTE MEER: from there it is a 150m walk to the Ghent Aula). The
transport system is Ghent is excellent and always on time. A single
ticket costs € 1.50 if bought in the bus/tram or € 1.20 if bought from
ticket machine of small kiosk called lijnwinkel, such ticket is valid
for an hour's travel on all trams and buses.

If you are coming by car, Ghent can be reached through the E40 and the
E17. There are 2 parkings nearby: Parking Korte Meer and Parking Kouter.

## Conclusions

OWASP has assembled this list to raise awareness about web application
security. The experts at OWASP have concluded that these vulnerabilities
represent a serious risk to agencies and companies that have exposed
their business logic to the Internet. Web application security problems
are as serious as network security problems, although they have
traditionally received considerably less attention. Attackers have begun
to focus on web application security problems, and are actively
developing tools and techniques for detecting and exploiting them.

This Top Ten list is only a starting point. We believe that these flaws
represent the most serious risks to web application security, but there
are many other security critical areas that were considered for the list
and also represent significant risk to organizations deploying web
applications. These include flaws in the areas of:

  - Unnecessary and Malicious Code
  - Broken Thread Safety and Concurrent Programming
  - Unauthorized Information Gathering
  - Accountability Problems and Weak Logging
  - Data Corruption
  - Broken Caching, Pooling, and Reuse

We welcome your feedback on this Top Ten list. Please participate in the
OWASP mailing lists and help to improve web application security. Visit

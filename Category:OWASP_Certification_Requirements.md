## What should an exam feel like?

  - Exams are proctored, timed, and delivered in a secure environment.
    Most exams last approximately two hours.
  - Candidates must acknowledge the OWASP Certification and
    Confidentiality Agreements online at the authorized testing center
    prior to taking any OWASP Certification exam. Candidates will not be
    able to proceed with the exam and a refund will not be provided.
    Signing this legal agreement is required to be officially certified.
  - Exams can be very challenging, going beyond simple recall and
    requiring candidates to engage in on the job types of problem
    solving. Questions include multiple-choice single answer,
    multiple-choice multiple answers, drag and drop, fill in the blank
    and simulations.
  - Exams other than final exams are delivered online, with questions in
    sequence, and do not allow a candidate to "mark" and return to an
    exam question.
  - Candidates will be provided with an erasable note board and marker
    for notes and calculations to assist them as they answer the
    questions.
  - Exams may contain non-scored items to collect performance data on
    new items. Non-scored items are not used in determining the passing
    score nor are reported in a subsection of the score report. All
    non-scored items are randomly placed in the exam with sufficient
    time calculated and given to complete the entire exam.
  - At the completion of computer-based exams, candidates receive a
    score report along with a score breakout by exam section and the
    passing score for the given exam. For onsite proctored exams,
    candidates receive a score report along with a score breakout by
    exam section and the passing score for the given exam within ten
    business days.

## Learning Outcomes

  - Be concise. Each question should be one to two sentences
  - Describe the behavior as a desired end product
  - Focus on observable behaviors only
  - Use definite terms (write, define, list, identify, predict, select,
    etc)

    etc.)

Bad Examples...

1.  Develop accuracy (undefined trait)
2.  Know the rules for constructing essay tests (indefinite term)
3.  Define and calculate the mean and explain its uses (multiple
    behaviors)

Good Examples...

1.  Identifies the correct definition of terms
2.  Mount a USB key drive
3.  Schedule a cron job

## Content Area (Master)

The third exam will be a written essay or presentation on a topic deemed
appropriate by the OWASP board. The deciding criteria will be determined
by OWASP chapter leaders. Each chapter leader will receive one vote. The
OWASP Certification Project Leader also gets one vote and subject area
contributors also will receive one vote. If people play both roles, then
they are permitted two votes. In order to pass, a candidate must receive
more positive votes than negative.

## Exam Details

  - The first exam will consist of 100 to 120 questions (random) where
    the format can include:
      - Multiple-choice single answer
      - Multiple-choice multiple answer
      - Drag-and-drop
      - Fill-in-the-blank
      - Testlet
      - Simlet
      - Simulations
  - Before taking the exam, candidates should become familiar with how
    all exam types function-especially the testlet, simlet, and the
    simulation tool. Such practice will allow candidates to focus their
    exam-taking efforts on the exam questions rather than on how to
    correctly use the tools.
  - Candidates may only take a beta exam once.
  - Candidates who fail an exam must wait a period of ninety (90)
    calendar days, beginning the day after the failed attempt, before
    they may retest for the same exam.
  - Once passed, a candidate must wait a minimum of 180 days before
    taking the same exam with an identical exam number.

Passing scores are set by using statistical analysis and are subject to
change. At the completion of the exam, candidates receive a score report
along with a score breakout by exam section and the passing score for
the given exam. OWASP does not publish exam passing scores because exam
questions and passing scores are subject to change without notice.

## Branding

You will notice that we have not landed on the branding aspects around
each certification level. The headings reflect much of our current
thinking. We will put out a survey to OWASP membership regarding
branding aspects after we have completed item development.

In terms of names of the certification, we are currently exploring:

  - Certified (Web) Application Security *(level, above)*
  - Certified (Web) Application Security Professional/Practitioner
  - OWASP Web Application Security Professional/Practitioner
      - [Recursive
        acronym](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_acronym)
      - Identical to *OWASP* which could be confusing

## Policies

All content, specifically questions, answers and diagrams of the
certification exams are the proprietary and confidential property of
OWASP. They may not be copied, reproduced, modified, published,
uploaded, posted, transmitted, or distributed in any way without the
express written authorization of OWASP. Candidates who sit for OWASP
exams must agree they have read and will abide by the terms and
conditions of the OWASP Certification and Confidentiality Agreements
before beginning the certification exam. The agreement applies to all
exams. Signing and adhering to this agreement is required to be
officially certified and to maintain valid certification.

## Conduct

Candidates must take no action to compromise the integrity or
confidentiality of any OWASP certification exam or certification
program. Penalties for violating the policy can include up to and
including a lifetime ban on all future exams and the nullification of
all previous certifications.

## Correspondence

All official correspondence to certified candidates is sent to the email
and/or address recorded in the OWASP Certifications Tracking System.
Candidates are responsible for updating their personal information in
the Tracking System to ensure receipt of official correspondence.

## Other Disclaimers

  - The target count for questions is the number of desired questions
    that are part of the exam question pool at any one time. Over time,
    questions will be expired and new ones will be added. The pool of
    questions created by the project team should be double the indicated
    target count.
  - Each subject area will have two reviewers of which the project
    manager may agree to be one.
  - The indicated target count should not be construed as to the number
    of questions that will be asked in any given exam. This will be
    determined based on psychometric analysis and/or other factors
    including but not limited to:
      - Analysis of statistics provided by initial OWASP Certification
        Survey
      - Detection of exam cheating (e.g. collusion, fraud, etc) by test
        takers
      - Feedback received from beta test takers
      - Adjustments to the exam to target first time test taker failure
        rate
  - The Project Leader and members of the OWASP board will be the only
    entities that will ever see the entire question set
  - No exam test taker, their employers or potential employers should
    assume that those who pass are suitable for any particular purpose,
    only that they have demonstrated sufficient knowledge of the subject
    areas covered by the exam
  - OWASP reserves the right to revoke certification of test takers who
    have been validated as cheats on other IT certifications

OWASP respects your privacy and is committed to protect the personal
information that you share with us. The OWASP Privacy Policy describes
how we collect and use your personal information.

  - OWASP reserves the right to publish the names and full contact
    information of any individual or party who compromises the validity
    of the certification process

<p><img src="Mth3l3m3nt-dashboard.PNG" title="fig:Mth3l3m3nt-dashboard.PNG" alt="Mth3l3m3nt-dashboard.PNG" /> OWASP Mth3l3m3nt Framework is a penetration testing aiding tool and exploitation framework. Mth3l3m3nt provides the ability to create or do custom LFI and RFI exploits fast with little or no effort at all. It also enables you to store all your quick wins based on its ability to manage HTTP bots, say no to runaway web shells and yes to centrally managed herds in large penetration testing engagements.</p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>The purpose of this project is to provide a platform to enable more flexible testing especially in aspects regarding to web security and the OWASP top 10 threats to web applications. This will enable free and opensource collaboration, being a web based tool, it is intended to make offensive security on the web easier and more efficient as it leverages on existing technologies with few dependencies. It is built on purely opensource components. It is intended to build up to a fully fledged web penetration testing framework with extensibility for zero day exploits in minutes to users. Currently the features it offers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multi-Database Support (JIG,SQLite,MySQL,MongoDB,PostgreSQL,MSSQL)</li>
<li>LFI/RFI exploitation Module</li>
<li>Web Shell Generator (ASP,PHP,JSP,JSPX,CFM)</li>
<li>Payload Encoder and Decoder</li>
<li>Custom Web Requester (GET/HEAD/TRACE/OPTIONS/POST)</li>
<li>Web Herd (HTTP Bot tool to manage web shells)</li>
<li>Client Side Obfuscator</li>
<li>Cookie Theft Database Module for potency in stored XSS attacks.</li>
<li>String Tools</li>

<p>It's a tool to exploit the web using the web when simply put. Imagine testing applications on the go, checking for vulnerabilities and analysing assets with no need for complex environments, just your simple web server and a database server, yes it can run on your tab too. tested with Palapa webserver on android running on Lighttpd and MySQL and it works well there also. This project aims to be that tool on the go and with time it will achieve its full potential.</p>

# FAQs

## How can I participate in your project?

All you have to do is make the Project Leader(s) aware of your available
time to contribute to the project. It is also important to let the
Leader(s) know how you would like to contribute and pitch in to help the
project meet it's goals and milestones. There are many different ways
you can contribute to an OWASP Project, but communication with the leads
is key.

## If I am not a programmer can I participate in your project?

Yes, you can certainly participate in the project if you are not a
programmer or technical. The project needs different skills and
expertise and different times during its development. Currently the most
important aspects though would be along, graphics and UX design as well
as researchers etc. Any Ideas are welcome to participate in the project.

# Acknowledgements

## Contributors

The OWASP Mth3l3m3nt Framework project is developed by a worldwide team
of volunteers. A live update of project [contributors is found
here](https://github.com/alienwithin/mth3l3m3nt-framework/graphs/contributors).
We can't forget the great support of the
[Africahackon](http://www.africahackon.com) team as this began to take
flight and for testing some of its aspects. A special thanks should be
in order for the Pentest-tools team that inspired the Cookie theft
module.

The first contributors to the project were:

  - [Munir Njiru](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Munir_Njiru)
  - [Christian Knuth](https://github.com/ikkez)

# Road Map and Getting Involved

Currently already available is the source code ready for download and
use. Working on sample videos for it and a PDF document on usage.

The project is envisioned to become a fully fledged security tool to
test the OWASP top 10. Currently milestones achieved are:

  - A web bot commander over HTTP to enable post-exploitation more
    easily
  - A minimal web shell generator to use in commanding vulnerable hosts
    especially those with File Upload Vulnerabilities and some input
    injection ones.
  - A payload store to keep new and old payloads that you frequently use
    and lose.
  - An LFI/RFI exploiter to perform File inclusion attacks and create
    new exploits on the same.
  - A web request module similar to hurl.it currently supporting
    GET/HEAD/TRACE/OPTIONS/POST requests and data very useful when in
    need of fingerprinting based on server headers and response codes.
  - A payload encoder and decoder to convert payload strings e.g. Hex
    with 0x prefix for SQL Injection payloads.
  - Client Side Obfuscator
  - String Tools
  - Whois

It is envisioned to be enabled to test and exploit all the OWASP top 10
vulnerabilities with ease and scalability. For instance currently
developing an LFI exploit takes around 6 lines of code in the framework
making it quite efficient even for zero day's along the same lines. This
principle of ease is intended to be maintained through the project's
lifecycle if not made easier.

Involvement in the development and promotion of the OWASP Mth3l3m3nt
Framework Project is actively encouraged\! You do not have to be a
security expert in order to contribute. Some of the ways you can help:

  - Helping find references to some new exploits.
  - Project administration support.
  - Wiki editing support.
  - Writing documentation for its use.
  - Bringing in fresh design principles from a UX perspective

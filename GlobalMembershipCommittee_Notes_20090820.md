  - General catch up

<!-- end list -->

  - Kate shared with the group the labor-intensive process of shipping
    out membership kits; including her time, the cost exceeds the
    available 30 USD per member.

<!-- end list -->

  - Current individual membership count is just over 700 and was 652 on
    August 06.

<!-- end list -->

  - Discussed having a Membership Committee presence at the AppSec DC
    conference November 10-13th. Kate volunteered to be there and do
    something after the initial rush of registration on the first day;
    note that she is the only person that can process credit cards on
    the spot.

<!-- end list -->

  - Discussed situations that required voting and who should qualify.
      - Electing a board member - electing a 6th Board Member has been
        discussed - should be done by current OWASP contributors, which
        include: (1) Paid Members; (2) Board Members; (3) Chapter
        Leaders; (4) Committee Members; and (5) Project Leaders of
        active projects as determined by the Global Projects Committee
        (if somebody belongs to more than one group, they still have
        only one vote).
      - Excluding for board membership, other elections should have a
        broader base of voters - perhaps including non-member chapter
        meeting attendees.
      - Kate will present the committee's recommendations at the next
        Board Meeting.

<!-- end list -->

  - Discussed getting more organization supporters, focusing on
    conference sponsors.

<!-- end list -->

  - Agreed to have a monthly meeting on the last Thursday of every month
    at 10 a.m. ET (United States).

  - Action on sponsorship guidelines. No sponsorship can be used to
    solicit additional chapter donations. As a non profit it is
    prohibited to solicit or trade out commercial exposure for donations
    to chapters.
  - New Chapter Opening Guidelines: Chapter's can only be opened by
    those who reside and will manage the chapters in the said country
    and region of the chapter. Opening of a chapter must be predicated
    by interviews with the required leadership in said location of the
    chapter with a confirmation by the leaders that they live and work
    and will manage the chapter in the location.

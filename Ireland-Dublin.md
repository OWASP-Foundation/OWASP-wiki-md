Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>We're happy to announce that we will be hosting our next OWASP Dublin chapter event in the Morgan McKinley’s office on Wednesday April 27th 2016 at 6:30pm and will be focused on DevOps. Please feel free to forward the event to friends and colleagues. </p>
<p>We're hoping to have some gifts to give away as part of the night.<br />
 </p>
<p>Thanks to Morgan McKinley for sponsoring the event.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Session 1 - John Turner - Monkey Little</strong><br />
</p>
<p>John Turner has been developing software in the financial and betting industry since 1999. He has a huge interest in the changing ways in which software projects are being delivered. This has led John to discover, learn and apply the practices and principles fundamental to Agile software development particularly those of Scrum and Lean. More recently John spends his time identifying how best to leverage the emergence of Cloud (IAAS, PAAS, SAAS) to create more Agile businesses.<br />
</p>
<p>John's session will focus on "DevOps Adoption Patterns". While DevOps is still riding high on a peak of inflated expectations, a number of patterns of adoption are starting to emerge. The conceptual definition of Agile made it difficult to embrace until frameworks such as Scrum became popular. In this same way, the theoretical and visionary definition of DevOps is creating a barrier to entry for those eager to realise its benefits. Fear not, for there are brave soles who have gone before us that we can strive to emulate!  Join us to talk about some of the ways in which people are 'doing DevOps’.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Session 2 - Noel King - VSWare </strong><br />
</p>
<p>Noel is VP for Engineering at VSWare an Irish Software company which provides a cloud based administration system to the education sector.  He has led and developed software solutions across multiple sectors and is focused on driving excellence through team orientated development utilising the best industry standards. He has a passion for quality assurance, development automation, continuous delivery and leveraging cloud to get your product to market quicker.<br />
</p>
<p>He spends his free time volunteering with CoderDojo, mentoring the technology innovators of the future, building cool and fun course material and promoting the ideology.  Passionate about education and inspiring the next generation he created CoderDojo Coolest Projects Awards.  The Coolest Projects is now Ireland's largest tech event that focuses on creativity takes place annually in Dublin and Silicon Valley.<br />
</p>
<p>Noel's session is entitled "Banishing Snakes from Green Field Development". <br />
</p>
<p><strong>Session 3 - Ryan Sudding - VMware</strong></p>
<p>Ryan works for VMware as a Systems Engineer. He has spent the last number of years working as an Infrastructure Consultant, but more recently has spent more time working with the VMware Network and Security Business Unit. He loves cars, travel and spending time with his wife and 11 month old daughter.<br />
</p>
<p>Ryan's session will be primarily focused on the current security landscape and also will also try debunk a few security myths.<br />

<p>'''Session 1 – Hugh Jones - General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) ''' <embed src="OWASP_INtro_to_GDPR_1603.ppt" title="fig:File:OWASP_INtro_to_GDPR_1603.ppt" /><br />
With the current EU legislation passing its 20th year back in October, it is high time that the EU Data Protection regime caught up with everything that is happening in the commercial, technological and social media sectors. The EU Commission has recently published the final draft of the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), scheduled to take effect across the EU in early 2018.<br />
</p>
<p>For organisations who already have a culture of DP compliance in place, the new Regulation will introduce a few changes, but nothing particularly challenging. For those who have ignored or failed to step up to the 1995 Directive, the next two years could be a very busy time indeed!<br />
This overview of the Regulation provides an understanding of the key concepts contained in the new legislation, the main areas of change, and some good advice on the steps which organisations need to take in order to prepare in a timely and organised manner. The key motto being: “Don’t Panic!””<br />
<strong>Session 2 – Working in IT Security</strong></p>
<p>A panel of experts will discuss what it is like to work in IT Security industry in Ireland.

Penetration testers spend most of their time identifying security holes. Sometimes if we’re lucky enough, we hit the jackpot. In this talk, I will be detailing some instances of real life attacks on web applications. I’ll show how one small vulnerability, in conjunction with others, can be lethal and lead to a big breach. This will highlight the importance of fixing the small issues that are usually neglected. Also, I’ll show some interesting tricks that can be used to exploit existing vulnerabilities.</p>

<p><strong>Tony Clarke – ICON PLC - Application security in a cyber security program</strong> <embed src="OWASP-v1.0.pptx" title="fig:File:OWASP-v1.0.pptx" /><br />
Data breaches such as the recent Talk Talk and Vtech breaches are regularly reported on in the media and its clear that existing approaches to application security are flawed and failing. This session will examine application security in the context of a cyber security program and will outline an approach to application security which facilitates modern development practices and standards. The session will examine security models, controls, processes and metrics which are required to prevent, detect and respond to these types of breach and integrate with operational models and compliance requirements.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Will Bailey – IBM - Drop your breaches</strong> <embed src="OWASP_will_20151210.pptx" title="fig:File:OWASP_will_20151210.pptx" /><br />
In this talk, I'll cover how we could be doing a much better job of improving the security of applications by educating developers better and why the approach a lot of the current security education employs both in the professional and academic spheres is wrong.</p>
<p>I'll also explain why it's a reflection on why I'm more likely to hire a half decent coder than a security graduate these days, so if you're currently studying and/or looking to get a a job in application security / ethical hacking in the near future this might be your ticket!</p>

<strong>Understanding cyber gaps in the human</strong><br />
'''Jason Flood – Ethical Hacker IBM '''<br />
<strong>Abstract:</strong><br />
A Capture the Flag tournament, also known as a CTF is a framework often found at conferences such as IRISS, OWASP, Blackhat and many more. For the last number of years as part of my PhD research I have been creating CTF frameworks that operate at local, national and international levels, some of you may have played them or at least seen them, and looking at the results.   These CTF events were built using a variety of architectures, network topologies and programming languages. The challenges they presented also varied both in complexity of exploit and potential organisational damage if exploited.</p>
<p>Today we see attack know-how and attacker tools being freely traded on the internet, enabling hackers and exposing organisations to an even greater communal risk. Arguably it can be said that every organisation no matter the size needs a business plan.  If that business has an online footprint, then a part of that plan needs to focus on it's own cyber risk profile.</p>
<p>Join us to explore how CTF applied methodologies can be used as part of business decisions around resource management, defensive technology solutions, defect management and other aspects of business activities that are associated with operating in a hostile environment such as the internet.<br />

<em>' The Encrypted Token Pattern CSRF Defence</em>'<br />
<em>'Paul Mooney – Freelance, Ryanair Labs, insidethecpu.com</em><br />
I’m the creator of the Encrypted Token Pattern and ARMOR, its .NET implementation. I specialise in taking apart problems, designing solutions, and providing those solutions as downloadable software frameworks, available under the MIT License. I’m a Software Architect, happiest when designing solutions to problems from a conceptual point-of-view, while getting my hands dirty assembling the nuts and bolts. For that reason, I try to avoid titles; if I had to brand myself, I’m a Technology Consultant. I’m most accomplished in C# in terms of language, however I’m also very proficient in JavaScript, Java, and Google Go. I’m a software-development mentor, and enjoy guiding teams of engineers toward effective technology-driven solutions to real-world problems.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br />
The Encrypted Token Pattern is a defence mechanism against Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks, and is an alternative to its sister-patterns; Synchroniser Token, and Double Submit Cookie. This article discusses the merits and means of implementing this defence mechanism in web-based applications.</p>
<p><em>Brief Description</em> The Encrypted Token Pattern The Encrypted Token Pattern leverages a single token, as opposed to dual tokens, and offers a more narrow scope of failure than alternative CSRF protection patterns.<br />
Leveraging the Encrypted Token Pattern The Advanced Resilient Mode of Recognition (ARMOR) is a C# implementation of the Encrypted Token Pattern, available on GitHub under the MIT license that provides a means of protecting ASP.NET applications from CSRF attacks, by leveraging the Encrypted Token Pattern. A Java equivalent of ARMOR is under construction and will be available soon.<br />
ARMOR ARMOR is a framework composed of interconnecting components exposed through custom web- handlers. ARMOR is essentially an advanced encryption and hashing mechanism, leveraging the Rijndael encryption standard, and SHA256 hashing by default.</p>

<em>' AppSec Survey 2.0: Fine-Tuning an AppSec Training Program Based on Data</em>'<br />
<strong>John Dickson – Denim Group</strong> (https://www.linkedin.com/pub/john-b-dickson-cissp/0/149/41a)<br />
John Dickson is an internationally recognized security leader, entrepreneur and Principal at Denim Group, Ltd. He has nearly 20 years hands-on experience in intrusion detection, network security and application security in the commercial, public and military sectors. As a Denim Group Principal, he helps executives and Chief Security Officers (CSO’s) of Fortune 500 companies and government organizations launch and expand their critical application security initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br />
Measuring the effectiveness of any security activity is widely discussed – security leaders debate the topic with a religious fervor rivaling that of any other hot button issue. Virtually every organization has some sort of application security training effort, but data on training effectiveness remains scarce. Last year our research team delivered the first-ever survey that captured developer awareness of secure coding concepts and the impact of formal application security training on a developer’s ability to write secure code. We learned that most software developer were aware of certain application security concepts, yet when asked how to write more secure code, they faired poorly. This year’s 600-developer survey provides more quantitative data on what software developers understand about application security, both concepts and practices. It dives most deeply into awareness of defensive coding practices, which most developers largely did not grasp in the 2013 survey. It also is separates respondents by roles, so we can better understand how architects, developers, and QA staff grasp key application security concepts and put them to work. It better captures how software developers learn in general, so one can tailor any security training effort to how software developers, in practice, actually learn. This information will provide data to application security managers responsible for corporate security training that should allow them to make more fact-based decisions about security training.</p>

Sean leads the development of the mobile components in the OWASP Security Shepherd project.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br />
The OWASP Security Shepherd project has been designed and implemented with the aim of fostering and improving security awareness among a varied skill¬set demographic.</p>
<p>Security Shepherd covers the OWASP Top Ten web app risks and has recently been injected with totally new content to cover the OWASP Top Ten Mobile risks as well. Many of these levels include insufficient mitigations and protections to these risks, such as blacklist filters, atrocious encoding schemes, barbaric security mechanisms and poor security configuration.</p>
<p>The modules have been crafted to provide not only a challenge for a security novice, but security professionals as well. We're going to speak about the platform itself and what it offers someone wishing to teach or learn about mobile and web application security, such as the project’s anti plagiarism mechanisms or it’s flexible approach in presenting its users with lessons and resources.<br />

<p>Talk 1: Building a shield of security - Vulnerability Management by the numbers and dumb robots!</p>
<p>Rahim Jina - BCC Risk Advisory</p>
<p>Rahim has been an active member of OWASP since 2008 and has contributed to many projects such as the OWASP Security Code Review Guide and is an ex-board member of the Irish Chapter. Previously Rahim was a senior security consultant at a “big 4” professional services firm and more recently, the head of security for Fonality Inc, a VoIP service provider based in Los Angeles. Rahim is currently a director for BCC Risk Advisory (bccriskadvisory.com), based in Dublin, Ireland. He is also responsible for the security architecture of the edgescan.comvulnerability management solution.</p>
<p>Abstract:</p>
<p>This presentation discusses how builders, breakers and defenders should look at vulnerability management when attempting to keep hackers at bay. We discuss the most common vulnerabilities which are not detected by security tools nor automation but nevertheless are common and can be used to commit real fraud resulting in financial loss. We will see that Web Application Firewalls are ineffective against such attacks and why the only practical solution is to apply a layered approach across all aspects of the SDLC.</p>
<p>Talk 2: "PCI's Changing Environment - What You Need to Know &amp; Why You Need To Know It".</p>
<p>Stephen Scott - Senior Consultant and PCI QSA in Espion's Information Government practice</p>
<p>Stephen Scott, Consultancy Team lead in Espion, is an experienced information security, risk and compliance consultant whose experience spans across many different areas including, PCI DSS, information security, risk management, group internal audit, IT service management and regulatory compliance. Stephen has extensive experience with information security, internal control testing, compliance programmes, information risk management, and process improvement. Stephen has worked across a wide range of industry verticals, including financial, industrial and insurance.</p>
<p>Abstract:</p>
<p>PCI DSS – The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard sets common requirements for securing payment card information (credit, debit, some gift cards), and lays out a range of controls relating to auditing, scanning and assessment.</p>
<p>This presentation discusses the ever evolving PCI environment, specifically focusing on the changes in the recent release of version 3 of the PCI DSS standard. Stephen will start off by giving a brief background to PCI, including motivators for merchant and service providers to adhere to the standard. In addition to this, the presentation will highlight what security considerations are relevant to application and information security practitioners.</p></td>

<p>“In 2010 Mr Haroon Meer from thinkst.com presented a timeline of memory corruption vulnerabilities and their mitigation techniques dating from 1985 to 2010. In his 35 page publication he referenced almost 150 events in low level information security history. The scope of the presentation "Low Level Exploits" is to explain in detail some of the most significant attacks in from Haroon Meers research. The attacks covered in this presentation include buffer overflows on the stack, heap overflows, integer overflows, format strings, null pointers and ROP chains. This brings us to exploits in the present day where researchers are looking for the successor of the buffer overflow attack, next big exploit.”</p></td>

"Image:Owasp logo Ireland Training 11 March 2010.gif")

  - **Overview & Goal**
      - Apart from OWASP's Top 10, most OWASP Projects are not widely
        used and understood. In most cases this is not due to lack of
        quality and usefulness of those Document & Tool projects, but
        due to a lack of understanding of where they fit in an
        Enterprise's security ecosystem or in the Web Application
        Development Life-cycle.
      - This course aims to change that by providing a selection of
        mature and enterprise ready projects together with practical
        examples of how to use them.
      - The course will be very practical where demonstration and
        hands-on exercises will be provided for the tools covered.
      - If you are interested in participating in the hands on portion
        of the course, please bring a laptop.

## OWASP August Event

**When:** 11/8/2010 6:00pm - 8:00pm
**Where:** Ernst & Young, Harcourt Street, Dublin 2, Opposite the Odeon
Pub, Dublin, Ireland

**Sponsors:** ![Image:Ey logo.gif](Ey_logo.gif "Image:Ey logo.gif")
**Title:** OWASP ESAPI Swingset: Introduction & Demo by Cathal
Courtney
**Abstract:** The ESAPI Swingset is a web application which demonstrates
common security vulnerabilities and asks users to secure the application
against these vulnerabilities using the ESAPI library. The application
is intended for Java Developers. The goal of the application is to teach
developers about the functionality of the ESAPI library and give users a
practical understanding of how it can be used to protect web
applications against common security vulnerabilities. During the talk,
Cathal will demonstrate how to install and use ESAPI Swingset in your
organization. A copy of the latest version will be also provided to the
attendees.
**Presenter:** Cathal is an experienced developer working at AIB and is
currently the ESAPI Swingset project leader. More information about this
project could be found here: [Esapi
SwingSet](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/ESAPI_Swingset)
**Download Presentation:** Not available

**Title:** Security Implications for Web Applications based on SOA by
John Marmelstein
**Abstract:** The main point of SOA (in this context) is combining
systems and applications to make new applications, or a big 'overall'
application.This higher inter-operability does (by default) lower
security. For a start, a request originating from a web user might end
up at several back end systems, which do not know who or what the
request came from.
Each back end system might have no access to the customer data, have a
different security models, and serve serveral front end. Each of the
above systems could be under different ownership, thus the owners have
different concerns and priorities. Also, the basic solution at a
technical level include single sign on, or security as a service. This
can be costly, give limited coverage and have a performance hit. But is
pretty much the only way to do it. The other thing to do (probably in
tandem) is strict management, and delegation of authority.
**Presenter:** John has about 13 years in IT. Most of this in
distributed systems and 'Middleware' integration software. Including BEA
(now owned by Oracle). Mainly working on Enterprise Java and more
recently on Microsoft BizTalk. Various industries, incuding financials,
public services, and a fish farm.

## OWASP Ireland Event - What is the O2 Platform?

**When:** 19/2/2010 3:00pm - 5:00pm
**Where:** Ernst & Young, Harcourt Street, Dublin 2, Opposite the Odeon
Pub, Dublin, Ireland

**Sponsors:** ![Image:Ey logo.gif](Ey_logo.gif "Image:Ey logo.gif")
**Title:** OWASP O2 Platform - Open Platform for automating application
security knowledge and workflows
**Abstract:** In this talk Dinis Cruz will show the OWASP O2 Platform
which is an open source toolkit specifically designed for developers and
security consultants to be able to perform quick, effective and thorough
'source-code-driven' application security reviews. The OWASP O2 Platform
(http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_O2_Platform) consumes results
from the scanning engines from Ounce Labs, Microsoft's CAT.NET tool,
FindBugs, CodeCrawler and AppScan DE, and also provides limited support
for Fortify and OWASP WebScarab dumps. In the past, there has been a
very healthy skepticism on the usability of Source Code analysis engines
to find commonly found vulnerablities in real world applications. This
presentation will show that with some creative and powerful tools, it IS
possible to use O2 to discover those issues. This presentation will also
show O2's advanced support for Struts and Spring MVC.

**Presenter:** Dinis Cruz is a Security Consultant based in London (UK)
and specialized in: ASP.NET/J2EE Application Security, Application
Security audits and .NET Security Curriculum Development. For the past
years Dinis has focused on the field of Static Source Code analysis,
from May 2007 to Dec 2009 he worked as a independent consultant for
Ounce Labs (bought by IBM in July 2009) where during active security
engagements using Ounce's technology he developed the Open Source
codebase which now is the foundation of the OWASP O2 Platform. Dinis is
currently focused on making the O2 Platform the industry standard for
consuming, instrumenting and data-sharing between the multiple WebAppSec
tools, the Security consultants and the final developers. Dinis is a
also active trainer on .Net security having written and delivered
courses for IOActive, Foundstone, Intense School and KPMG (at multiple
locations including BlackHat), and has delivered a number of
presentations and keynote speeches at multiple OWASP and Security
related conferences. At OWASP, Dinis is the leader of the [OWASP O2
Platform](OWASP_O2_Platform "wikilink") project, member of the OWASP
[Global Projects Committee](Global_Projects_Committee "wikilink"), chair
of the [OWASP Connections
Committee](OWASP_Connections_Committee "wikilink") and member of the
[OWASP

plugin, or filter that applies a set of rules to an HTTP conversation.
Generally, these rules cover common attacks such as Cross-site Scripting
(XSS) and SQL Injection. By customizing the rules to your application,
many attacks can be identified and blocked. The effort to perform this
customization can be significant and needs to be maintained as the
application is modified.
Mark will be presenting on his experience in implementing a Web
Application Firewall solution through all phases from research to
implementation.

**Presenters:**

**Mark Hillick - Application Networking Team, Citrix Systems**

## OWASP Event: Define Security Requirements - A practical approach

**When:** 20/5/2010 6:30pm - 7:30pm
**Where:** Ernst & Young, Harcourt Street, Dublin 2, Opposite the Odeon
Pub, Dublin, Ireland

**Sponsors:** ![Image:Ey logo.gif](Ey_logo.gif "Image:Ey logo.gif")
**Title:** Define Security Requirements - A practical approach
**Abstract:** The Data Protection Act states that "appropriate security
measures" must be taken to protect personal data. How do you specify the
appropriate security measures for a website which processes personal
data? It is an important step in a development project, but is often
neglected. In this talk, Alexis will descibe his own experiences of
assessing web application, and will also look in more detail at what the
Data Protection Commissioner says. He will then take a fictional website
and look at a practical approach to specifying the security requirements
that the fictional application should meet. This will use the kind of
risk-based techniques outlined by OWASP or the Microsoft Secure
Development Lifecycle (SDL). Issues discussed will include encryption,
authentication, access control, audit, etc. The result will be a list of
security requirements that can be carried into the design and
development phases. Attendees should be able to apply the ideas to their
own development projects.

**Presenters:**

**Alexis Fitzgerald - Rits Information Security Group**
For the last six years Alexis has worked for Rits Information Security
Group, where he performs application penetration testing assignments as
well as advising clients on application security issues. Before that, he
spent many years as a developer (mainly in the financial sector), and he
continues to be involved in development. Alexis holds an MSc in
Information Security from the University of London, Royal Holloway.

## Trainings

### Application Security Primer

This workshop is an introduction into (web) application security with
hands-on labs, using OWASP documentation and tooling. You will be
introduced into the security mindset, discus the OWASP TopTen 2013 and
learn basic skills in how to find vulnerabilities in web applications.
All tools and documentation are provided during the training. As this is
an hands-on workshop, please bring your own laptop\!

#### Prerequisites for this workshop

  -
    Laptop with Virtualbox or VMware
    Basic understanding of HTTP and web application testing/development
    An open mind

### Hands-on Threat Modeling

This is a 1 day, trainer-led, on-site, Threat Modeling course. The
training material and hands-on workshops include real live Use Cases.
The students will be challenged to perform practical threat modeling in
groups of 3 to 4 people covering the different stages of threat modeling
on:

  - B2B web and mobile applications, sharing the same REST backend
  - An Internet of Things (IoT) deployment with an on premise gateway
    and cloud-based secure update service

Threat modeling is the primary security analysis task performed during
the software design stage. Threat modeling is a structured activity for
identifying and evaluating application threats and vulnerabilities. The
security objectives, threats, and attacks modeling activities during the
threat modeling are designed to help you find vulnerabilities in your
application. You can use the identified vulnerabilities to help shape
your design and direct and scope your security testing.

Threat modeling allows you to consider, document, and discuss the
security implications of designs in the context of their planned
operational environment and in a structured fashion. Threat modeling
also allows consideration of security issues at the component or
application level. The threat modeling course will teach you to perform
threat modeling through a series of workshops, where our trainer will
guide you through the different stages of a practical threat model.

This course is aimed at software developers, architects, system managers
or security professionals. Before attending this course, students should
be familiar with basic knowledge of web and mobile Applications and
databases. The students should bring their own laptop to the course.

#### Course topics (1 day)

Threat modeling introduction

  - Threat modeling in a secure development lifecycle
  - What is threat modeling
  - Why threat modeling?
  - Threat modeling stages
  - Diagrams
  - Identify threats
  - Addressing threats
  - Document a threat model

Diagrams – what are you building?

  - Understanding context
  - Doomsday scenarios
  - Data flow diagrams
  - Trust Boundaries
  - **Hands-on: diagram B2B web and mobile applications, sharing the
    same REST backend**

Identifying threats – what can go wrong?

  - STRIDE introduction

  - **Hands-on: STRIDE analysis of an Internet of Things (IoT)
    deployment with an on premise gateway and cloud-based secure update
    service**

Addressing each threat

  - Mitigation patterns
  - Authentication: mitigating spoofing
  - Integrity: mitigating tampering
  - Non-repudiation: mitigating repudiation
  - Confidentiality: mitigating information disclosure
  - Availability: mitigating denial of service
  - Authorization: mitigating elevation of privilege

Threat modeling tools

  - General tools
  - Open-Source tools
  - Commercial tools

The course students receive the following package as part of the course:

  - Hand-outs of the presentations
  - Work sheets of the use cases,
  - Detailed solution descriptions of the use cases
  - Template to document a threat model
  - Template to calculate risk levels of identified threats

The students should bring their own laptop

#### Threat Modeling – real life use cases

As highly skilled professionals with years of experience under our belts
we know that there is a gap between academic knowledge of threat
modeling and the real world. In order to minimize that gap we have
developed practical Use Cases, based on real life projects. Each use
case includes a description of the environment, together with questions
and templates to build a threat model. Using this methodology for the
hands on workshops we provide our students with a robust training
experience and the templates to incorporate threat modeling best
practices in their daily work. The students will be challenged to
perform the threat modeling in groups of 3 to 4 people performing the
different stages of threat modeling on:

  - B2B web and mobile applications, sharing the same REST backend
  - An Internet of Things (IoT) deployment with an on premise gateway
    and cloud-based secure update service

After each hands-on workshop, the results are discussed, and the
students receive a documented solution.

### Security Shepherd

Want to learn the basics of Web App pen testing? Or would you prefer to
develop new advanced pen testing tricks? Join the us for the lightning
Security Shepherd Web Application training session that will bring
attendees up to speed on all the latest and greatest security testing
techniques that are a concern in the industry today. Compete against
other participants and solve increasingly complex security puzzles
derived from real world security threats. Attendees will leave with a
real familiarity of web application pen testing best practice,
terminology, workflow's and commonly used tool kits.
\====Prerequisites==== A Laptop Capable of Connecting to Internet on the
day You should have Java, Java Installed, OWASP ZAP / Burpsuite
Downloaded or Installed, Firefox is the browser of choice.

### O-saft

The use of SSL/TLS to protect the transport of data has become very
common today. On the other hand it does not work pretty 'out of the
box'. Furthermore it has more and more secuirty issues. As a consequence
it often does not protect as assumed. It is often difficult to
understand, what are the root causes of the issues, and how to detect
and finally avoid or fix them.
This training will give a brief introduction to SSL, how it works i. g.,
what issues are related to the protocol, the PKI used, and the known
vulnerabilities including potential attacks and provide tools to check
for these issues. The main focus will be on SSL/TLS used in HTTPS. Other
usages i.e. SSL for SMTP are a small subset. As a round-up there will be
recommendations how to configure and maintain TLS securely.

#### Course Topics

The main part of the course will be a hands-on-training showing by
example how to check the established TLS/SSL connection (including
ciphers) to a web server and show how to analyse the provided
certificate. Various tools will be explained. It will be demonstrated
how these tools can be used to detect weaknesses in the TLS/SSL
connection and such.
The explained tools are for example: openssl, sslscan, testssl.sh,
o-saft, and some more, as well as some online checking tools like
ssllabs.com. We show what are these tools useful for, what they can do,
and what they cannot. Finally we show how the OWASP tool o-saft can be
used to cover most of the previous shown techniques and how to use its
advanced features like:

  - checking for ciphers
  - checking for special SSL settings
  - check multiple servers at a time
  - customizing the results
  - customizing o-saft itself
  - or simple debugging of various SSL connection problems.

The purpose of this course is to provide a tool set for checking TLS/SSL
to the participants, and teach the participants how and when to use
which tool, and why some tools do not provide complete results (e.g.
protocols, ciphers). The course is about analysing TLS/SSL from a
client-site view. It will not go into the details of fuzzing or even
breaking TLS/SSL, or exploiting vulnerabilities. Mostly we will analyse
HTTPS, furthermore we will provide some examples for protocols using
STARTTLS, too (e.g. SMTP).
Additionally it will give system architects, administrator, or
operational people, hints how to set-up and configure TLS/SSL in a
proper secure way.

#### Technical requirements

The participants should bring their own laptop with any operating system
(recommended is Linux) and at least following tools installed:

  - openssl (1.0.1e or newer)
  - perl (5.8 or newer), on windows system Strawberry perl is
    recommended
  - Net::SSLeay (1.53 or newer), IO::Socket::SSL (1.37 or newer)
  - Tcl (8.5) optional, on a windows system ActiveTcl (8.6) is
    recommended
  - python (2.7) optional

Optional, for smooth testing, a local SSL-enabled (SSLv2, SSLv3, TLS)
web server should be running on the laptop (i.e. OWASP-BWA).

## Talks

### Gamers, You're the New Botnets

Downloading, playing, downloading, playing, downloading, playing,
downloading, playing, downloading, playing... that is really funny. You
can try new games every day but the guys who share those games are not
just happy and funny people doing that just for pleasure to share
"games". Yeas, they're sharing games, but lot of other Tools they enjoy
to play with... Let's talk about malwares, about botnets, about
backdoors and about some computer which can win a "botnet award".

### [OWASP Top 10 Privacy Risks](OWASP_Top_10_Privacy_Risks_Project "wikilink")

There are lively discussions about how to protect personal data
especially with the upcoming EU Data Protection Regulation that requires
Privacy by Design. But still there was no independent description of
privacy risks specifically for web applications available. Thus,
companies lack guidance to identify and avoid privacy risks during
systems development. Therefore the OWASP Top 10 Privacy Risks project
developed a list of the top 10 privacy risks in web applications. The
project covers technical and organizational aspects like missing
encryption or insufficient transparency and results and practical
countermeasures are presented in this session.

### LangSec meets State Machines

Language-theoretic Security, or LangSec for short, provides useful
insights into the root causes of an important class security flaws -
namely flaws in handling input - and ways to avoid these. This talk will
discuss the core ideas of LangSec and the relation with security
research we have done at over the years, where we used state machines as
a means to systematically investigate GSM, bank cards, internet banking
tokens, and TLS.

### The Tales of a Bug Bounty Hunter

Bug bounty hunting is the new black\! During this technical talk,
several interesting vulnerabilities identified in Instagram, the
increasingly-popular photo-based social media platform, will be
presented.
All vulnerabilities were disclosed responsibly via Facebook’s Public Bug
Bounty program over the course of 2015 and 2016, and will be discussed
in detail. Required advanced Mobile Security attack techniques for this
Research, such as Binary Modification, Dynamic Hooking and Burp Suite
Plugin Development will be covered, among other trickery.
The most interesting vulnerabilities were hybrid: Combinations of
complementary vulnerabilities in different environments (e.g. Web and
Mobile). All identified issues’ root causes will be mapped onto the
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), to analyze where they could have
been prevented from materializing. Last but not least, the monetary
rewards offered by Facebook for each vulnerability and general Bug
Bounty Hunting advice will be shared with the community.

### [OWASP Security Knowledge Framework](OWASP_Security_Knowledge_Framework "wikilink")

Over 10 years of experience in web application security bundled into a
single application.
The Security Knowledge Framework is a vital asset to the coding toolkit
of you and your development team.
Use SKF to learn and integrate security by design in your web
application.

SKF is an open source security knowledgebase including manageble
projects with checklists and best practice code examples in multiple
programming languages showing
you how to prevent hackers gaining access and running exploits on your
application.
<b>We will be talking about:</b>

  - Training your developers in writing secure code
  - Security support pre-development (Security by design, early feedback
    of possible security issues)
  - Security support post-development(Double check your code by means of
    the OWASP ASVS checklists )
  - Code examples for secure coding

### Challenges in Android Malware Detection

What is the state of Malware detection for Android? This talk will
present a landscape of Android Malware and techniques used to (try and)
detect Malware, with a focus on the limitations of the state-of-the-art
detection methods.

### Serial Killer: Silently Pwning your Java Endpoints

In this session we begin with modelling the attack surface of Java
deserialization, which often leads to remote code execution (RCE), by
showcasing vulnerabilities we found in modern and widely used
applications and frameworks. We extend existing research about risks of
deserialization broadening the attack surface. After a live demo of
getting a Meterpreter shell in a modern Java endpoint setup we delve
into the exploitation styles for this vulnerability to lay the
foundation of the first of three key takeaways for the attendees. The
first key takeaway is identification of test types that should be
executed during a dynamic assessment of an application in order to find
this kind of vulnerability. This includes analyzing the deserialization
interface and using blackbox tests to create payloads with gadgets
matching the application’s classpath to verify the RCE. Discussion
extends to cover indirect deserialization interfaces that use non-binary
data formats, such as XML-based interfaces, which can also act as a
driver for deserialization within the application. The next key takeaway
covers the realm of static code analysis (SAST). We present code
patterns security reviewers should look for when doing whitebox
assessments of applications or frameworks. This is especially
interesting for code offering dynamic functionality including AOP,
generic mappings, reflection, interceptors, etc. - all of which have a
high probability of including code that can facilitate as
deserialization gadgets and thus help the attackers in exploiting
deserialization vulnerabilities. In this section we present the
techniques used to find the vulnerabilities within the popular
frameworks showcased during the live demo at the session’s start.
Finally we conclude with tips on implementing different techniques of
hardening measures for applications offering deserialisation interfaces
(either direct binary deserialization interfaces or indirect XML-based
ones) to give the attendees the third key takeaway: protecting
applications properly. This includes ways to verify data integrity prior
to deserialization and ways to properly inspect the data before it’s
handled by the Java deserialization process.

### Experiences with Paste-Monitoring

Paste platforms like Pastebin.com provide the possibility to store and
share text online. Often this kind of services are used by programmers
but also abused by attackers to present their achievements. CIRCL acts
as a fire brigade and monitor several of those paste platforms to early
detect potential incidents and help the victims. The findings vary from
lists of vulnerable or compromised websites, leaked credentials,
database dumps, opportunistic announcements, stolen credit card details
and many more. We will present the used techniques, and some key
experiences with the findings and introduce the AIL framework -
Framework for Analysis of Information Leaks. AIL is designed to analyse
unstructured data and identify potential data leaks.

## The presentation

The correlation of results from "white box" static source code analysis
and "black box" dynamic penetration testing tools has been considered by
some to be the "holy grail" in software security testing. Unfortunately,
to date, solutions in this area have failed to provide meaningful
benefit.

Recent work at Fortify allows us to address this failure, moving past
simple correlation and ultimately providing what is truly beneficial -
insight into the black box results.

All that remains is to start the WebGoat lessons.

## One Last Point

If the problems or solutions do not reveal themselves to you, there are
hints available to guide you through the lessons. Don’t be too eager,
though – application testing is 10% technique and 90% lateral thinking.
You will learn and remember much more if you struggle through the
puzzles posed by the lessons. This will force you through a large number
of failed attempts and finally a flash of insight that brings you to the
solution. You can blame it on the Goat, but you can’t rely on him.

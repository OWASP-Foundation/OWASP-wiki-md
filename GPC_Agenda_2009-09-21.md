## From Previous Meeting/Follow up

  - "OWASP Mini-Summit 2009"/[:OWASP AppSec DC
    2009](:OWASP_AppSec_DC_2009 "wikilink"):
      - [Guidance from
        Board](:OWASP_Board_Meeting_September_01 "wikilink"):
          - "Begin with "state of OWASP" then maximum 1 hour given to
            each committee during the mini summit to present their
            issues and topics and board meeting at the end to vote.
            Thoughts about a panel discussion or debate during summit",
          - "Announcement for 6th Board member vote that will occur in
            November. Ballots to be created and candidates need to be
            placed on the ballot prior to 10/10/09",
          - "To register for summit must be a member: link to doc with
            name and membership number",
      - Build a frame for GPC's and Sebastien's involvement in the
        Mini-Summit's setting up.
      - Build a GPC's agenda to discuss in the Mini-Summit:
          - A few aspects to focus on:
              - Why hasn't the SoC 09 been launched still?
              - Which criteria should ultimately preside SoC's fund
                allocation?
              - GPC's new methodologies to manage and assess projects.
      - [Brad's draft of a template
        letter](https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/Doc?docid=0AQkwJ4Fmt3R3ZGdzN3NtNG5fNDRocTU0MjZkNg&hl=en)
        ([link to
        edit](https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/Doc?docid=0AQkwJ4Fmt3R3ZGdzN3NtNG5fNDRocTU0MjZkNg&hl=en))
        to be used by OWASP Board to be sent off to the committee
        members' employers explaining they have been invited to
        participate in the Mini-Summit. See also other Committee
        members' contributions.

-----

  - Spreading [OWASP Project Details
    Tab](:Template:OWASP_Project_Identification_Tab "wikilink") through
    ALL OWASP Projects.
      - Check and discuss the NEW ["OWASP Projects
        Dashboard"](OWASP_Project_Details_Table "wikilink"),
          - Note Paulo is still on his way to move [all this
            projects](https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/owasp.org/ccc?key=0An4Puwz7EA41cjJaamFRRGZXNVdRNlplR0s0cDFVRVE&hl=en)
            to the [Dashboard](OWASP_Project_Details_Table "wikilink"),
      - Discuss and decide the path to follow once the previous task is
        finished.
      - Does it make sense keeping in our new template the field
        ***Project Health*** while the criteria for its assessment
        haven't been built still? Couldn't we "hide" it until it is
        ready for public display?
  - Do we all agree with these [Dinis' and jeff's
    perspectives](http://shorttext.com/imjrt5ikq)? If so can we make a
    post in our [blog](http://globalprojectscommittee.wordpress.com/)
    advertising the GPC policy about this issue?

-----

  - Honorary memberships to be given to "active" OWASP participants
    (chapter leader, project participants, etc.). Chapter and projects
    committees to submit proposal for persons to be given membership.
      - Paulo is still working on it/the task is delayed.

-----

  - Projects committee should determine which projects/project leaders
    are supported financially. Travel, evangelism, publication,
    training, etc.....
      - Discuss the possibility of using the "OWASP on the Move"
        programme to fund the activities above mentioned
        (projects/project leaders: Travel, evangelism, publication,
        training, etc.....)
      - Follow up:
          - Matt Tesauro's draft to deal with this kind of issues.

-----

  - Committees can have paypal buttons on their pages to enable sponsors
    to dedicate the sponsor budget to a certain area. e.g. Education
      - The Paypal button has been installed in the Project's wiki page.
        Can be replicated wherever GPC decides to do so.

-----

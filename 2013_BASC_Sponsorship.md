| Silver      |        |
| Gold        |        |
| Platinum    |        |

We expect 175 attendees this year -- we grew about 20% in 2011 and we
will grow even more in 2013 due to conference reputation, earlier
publicity and a conference date not conflicting with other events.

Sponsorship is completely independent of and unrelated to speaking
slots. OWASP does not allow distribution of attendee lists, or use of
them for anything other than conference updates. OWASP is a 501c3
not-for-profit worldwide charitable organization.

You can register as a sponsor and pay online at

us your logo in various sizes for inclusion in this conference site.

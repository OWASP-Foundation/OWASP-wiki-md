''' 4.3 Testing for Configuration and Deployment management '''

-----

Understanding the deployed configuration of the server hosting the web
application is almost as important as the application security testing
itself. After all, an application chain is only as strong as its weakest
link. Application platforms are wide and varied, but some key platform
configuration errors can compromise the application in the same way an
unsecured application can compromise the server.

In order to evaluate the readiness of the application platform, testing
for configuration management includes the following sections:

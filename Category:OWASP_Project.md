<p>An OWASP project is a collection of related tasks that have a defined roadmap and team members. OWASP project leaders are responsible for defining the vision, roadmap, and tasks for the project. The project leader also promotes the project and builds the team. OWASP currently has ''''''over <em><strong>'93</strong></em>' active projects'''''', and new project applications are submitted every week.</p>
<p>This is one of the most popular divisions of OWASP as it gives members an opportunity to freely test theories and ideas with the professional advice and support of the OWASP community. Every project has an associated mail list. You can view all the lists, examine their archives, and subscribe to any project by visiting the <a href="http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo">OWASP Project Mailing Lists</a> page. A summary of recent project announcements is available on the <a href="OWASP_Updates" title="wikilink">OWASP Updates</a> page.</p>

## Quick Guide to Projects

### Quick Guide for Developers

This is a Quick Guide for Developers new to OWASP projects:

Infographic containing Hyperlinks to projects:

## Flagship Projects

![<File:Flagship_banner.jpg>](Flagship_banner.jpg
"File:Flagship_banner.jpg")

The OWASP Flagship designation is given to projects that have
demonstrated strategic value to OWASP and application security as a
whole. After a major review process [More info
here](LAB_Projects_Code_Analysis_Report "wikilink") the following
projects are considered to be flagship candidate projects. These project
have been evaluated more deeply to confirm their flagship status:

## Labs Projects

![<File:Lab> banner.jpg](Lab_banner.jpg "File:Lab banner.jpg")

OWASP Labs projects represent projects that have produced a deliverable
of value. While these projects are typically not production ready, the
OWASP community expects that an OWASP Labs project leader is producing
releases that are at least ready for mainstream usage.

### Thumbs up

Thumbs up are given to LAB projects showing a steady progress in their
development, had very active and continuous releases and commits,
regular update of information on their wiki page and have quite complete
documentation. These projects are almost ready to become flagship

## Incubator Projects

![<File:Incubator_banner.jpg>](Incubator_banner.jpg
"File:Incubator_banner.jpg")

OWASP Incubator projects represent the experimental playground where
projects are still being fleshed out, ideas are still being proven, and
development is still underway. The “OWASP Incubator” label allows OWASP
consumers to readily identify a project’s maturity. The label also
allows project leaders to leverage the OWASP name while their project is
still maturing.

### Thumbs up

Thumbs up are given to incubator projects showing a steady progress in
their development, had continuous releases and commits or have delivered
a complete product, including open source repository location, basic
user guidelines and documentation

## So you want to start a project...

Starting an OWASP project is quite easy, and your desire to contribute
and make it happen is essential.
![HowToStartProjectoWasp.png](HowToStartProjectoWasp.png
"HowToStartProjectoWasp.png")

Here are some of the guidelines for running a successful OWASP project:

\-Start exploring the actual OWASP projects Inventory. Many projects
handle specific areas of security it is a good idea to start looking how
other successful projects do this (LABS/Flagship)

\-Place your idea or project on the [Project Ideas
Board](Project_Ideas_Board#From_Idea_to_Project_Incubator "wikilink").
This phase will help you to define the project goals and also explore
and exchange with other OWASP leaders and volunteers how to develop the
idea into a tangible project

\-Explore and research if your idea covers a unique segment in the
Security arena. Think of your project as a product, if you really want
people using it, think how this project will cover a necessity in the
security area you are working on

\-Define what kind of project you would like to start. Is it a code,
tool or documentation?

\-Communicate through the Project leader mailing list about your idea
and get feedback and meet potential contributors

\-Develop your project based on the type of project. For example if you
are willing to start a documentation project, begin by defining a Table
of Content and work it through with potential contributors. First of all
begin by creating a Road-map for your project. This is essential to
submit your project. We highly recommend to read documentation such as
"[How to start /run a successful Open Source
Projects](http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/tesfatsi/ProducingOSS.KarlFogel2005.pdf)".

Some recommendations on how to start a documentation project [Document
Guide Project](:File:Document_Guide_\(1\).png "wikilink")

### Importance of a well thought out Road-map

Many Incubator project leaders struggle with creating a realistic
planning, which should be based on their available resources and time. A
well thought out plan makes a difference between a procrastinating
project and a successful one. The important aspect of this is, that the
project leader is able to create a plan based on his situation. The
following is an example of a Roadmap, which has focused to produce a
Documentation first release in a year and a basic outline how they plan
to cover 4 essential aspects which are Research & Development,
Marketing, Planning and Goals.

"Your \[project\] roadmap should tell a coherent story about the likely
growth of your product. Each release should build on the previous one
and move you closer towards your vision. Your roadmap should be
convincing and realistic: Don’t speculate or oversell your \[project\].
Be clear who your audience is: An internal roadmap talks to development,
marketing, sales, service, and the other groups involved in making your
\[project\] a success; and external one talks to existing and
prospective customers." Extracted from : "[10 Tips for Creating an Agile
Product
Roadmap](http://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-creating-agile-product-roadmap/)"

  - Start defining a development, documentation and marketing plan for
    your project. Set short , medium and long term plans. Include
    promotion of your project, this is very important in order to engage
    users and consumers of your project. You *can* run a single person
    project, but it's usually best to get the community involved. You
    should be prepared to support a mailing list, build a team, speak at
    conferences, and promote your project.

<!-- end list -->

  - You can contribute existing documents or tools to OWASP\! Assuming
    you have the intellectual property rights to a work, you can open it
    to the world as an OWASP Project. Please coordinate this with OWASP
    by [Contacting
    Us](https://owasporg.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/7/group/18/create/72).

<!-- end list -->

  - Available Grants to consider if you need funding - [Click

<!-- end list -->

  - You should promote your project through the OWASP channels as well
    as by outside means. Get people to blog about it\!

## **Creating a New Project**

Once you have passed the Project Ideas phase, then you will be ready to
start a new project

**[Please submit a new project application
here](https://owasporg.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/7/create/70).**'''

**2016 OWASP Project Process**

**Existing WORKFLOW** [Incubator Project
Flow](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=forums&srcid=MDM4NTc0NDY0NjkwMzEwMTMzMzkBMDIxODM3MDc5ODA4OTMxNjAzNjkBSFlWTDZaTE5Ed0FKATAuMQFvd2FzcC5vcmcBdjI)

**Step 1:** New Project Leader submits New Project Request Form it is
logged in the system and an alert is sent to the Project Coordinator

**Step 2:** New Project Request is received and reviewed by Project
Coordinator for complete information .It must contain the following
information to qualify as an acceptable submission: You will need to
gather the following information together for your application:

  - Project Name,
  - Project purpose / overview,
  - Project Roadmap,
  - Project links (if any) to external sites,
  - \[\[Guidelines_for_OWASP_Projects\#Project_Licensing|Project
    License\],\]
  - Project Leader name,
  - Project Leader email address,
  - Project Leader wiki account - the username (you'll need this to edit
    the wiki),
  - Project Contributor(s) (if any) - name email and wiki account (if
    any),
  - Project Main Links (if any).
  - \==\>For Documentation: A table of Contents
  - \==\>For Code: A prototype hosted in an open source repository of
    your choice.

**Step 3:** If all information is completed following the minimum
criteria for Projects (Code/Tool/documentation), The Project Coordinator
notifies the Project Leader that the request has been accepted, and at
the same time notifies the Review team that a new project has been
submitted, including all the information requested in the project
criteria

**Step 4:** Project Coordinator proceeds to create a new Wiki page for
the project including all the information sent by the project leader.
project coordinator uses one of these project wiki template:

  - For Docs:
    <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Documentation_Project_Template>
  - For Code:
    <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Code_Project_Template>
  - For Tool:
    <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Tool_Project_Template>

Also Project coordinator creates a mailing list for the project leader
and sets him as admin

**Step 5:** Project Coordinator notifies project leader and Review team
about the created wiki page, providing the link to the wiki page.

  - Review team might provide comments for further improvement of the
    wiki page if necessary
  - Project leader should request a wiki account to be able to update
    his own wiki page afterwards if he has not one yet

**Step 6:** Project coordinator updates the Wiki project inventory,
Dashboard and open hub with the information regarding the new created
project

**Step 7:** Project is set in the agenda by the Project Coordinator for
monitoring over the next 3 months to check how has been developing.

**Step 8:** Every 3 months, project coordinator monitors the activity on
the wiki page for new updates and on the Openhub for commits and level
of activity . Findings are then reported on the Dashboard as comments
and CC through email to the review team

**Step 9:** if the project has not been updated and has no activities
after six months of creation, project coordinator sends an email to the
project leader requesting an update and status to see how has been
developing, CC: project review team regarding the lack of activity
.Findings are then updated on the dashboard.

**Step 10:** Over the next 6 months the project is monitored again for
activity. If no updates have occurred since its inception after 12
months, project is then set as inactive and project leader and review
team is notified about the status. Project coordinators updates :

  - Wiki page of the project is labeled as 'inactive' (inactive banner)
  - The Project is set under the 'inactive category'
  - Dashboard is updated with comments and set as inactive

## OWASP Recommended Licenses

## Funding your Project

An OWASP project does not receive any funding for development at project
inception; however, a new project does have the opportunity to submit a
request to receive funds if they are available for the year.
Additionally, project leaders have the option of seeking sponsorship
from outside organizations, but project leaders are required to seek
funding through their own initiative.

## Project Release

As your project reaches a point that you'd like OWASP to assist in its
promotion, the will need the following information to help spread the
word about your project:

1.  Short 5 sentence paragraph outlining what your project is about,
    what you hope to accomplish with your project, what value your
    project brings to software security, and contributor and project
    leader names and contact information.
2.  Link to your wiki page.
3.  Link to your code repository or a link to where readers can download
    your project.
4.  Latest Release description answering the following questions: What
    is it?, What does it do?, Where can I get it?, Who should I contact
    if something goes wrong?.

## Project Process Forms

These forms were created to help project leaders, and those interested
in a going through a process in the OWASP projects infrastructure. They
facilitate the management of each query based on the specific task an
applicant will need help with. The forms are described below, and they
are linked with their designated online application form.

  - [Project Transition
    Application](https://www.tfaforms.com/264422):The OWASP project
    transition form gives current project leaders an easy way of handing
    over project administration information to individuals wishing to
    take over a project.

<!-- end list -->

  - [Project Review Application](https://www.tfaforms.com/264413):This
    form is for current project leaders to request a review of their
    project based on OWASP graduation criteria. The aim is to designate
    an OWASP volunteer to review these projects within 3 months time.

<!-- end list -->

  - [Project Donation Application](http://www.tfaforms.com/264418):This
    form is for projects outside of the OWASP project infrastructure.
    Project Leaders for these open source projects can choose to partner
    or give their project to OWASP directly through this form.

<!-- end list -->

  - [Project Adoption Request](https://www.tfaforms.com/264428):This
    form is used when someone is interested in adopting an archived
    project.

<!-- end list -->

  - [Project Abandonment Request](https://www.tfaforms.com/264426):The
    OWASP project abandonment form gives current project leaders an easy
    way of letting the OWASP Foundation know that they wish to resign
    their project leader duties. This form should be used when no
    replacement project leader exists to take over these duties.

<!-- end list -->

  - [Incubator Project Graduation
    Application](https://www.tfaforms.com/264392):This application form
    is for Incubator Projects to apply for Labs Project status.

# Participating in a Project

<font size=2pt>

## Joining a Project...

OWASP projects are community driven and most projects are open for
anyone motivated to join.

The first step is to find a project you are interested to be part of.
The list of all projects can be found in the
{{\#switchtablink:Project_Inventory|Project Inventory}}. Further steps
then depend on the status of the project you selected.

If the project is active, the best way is to join the mailing list and
get in touch with the people actively participating. Other ways would be
contacting the project leader team or just starting to participate by
testing the software, writing blogs or documentation, report issues via
tracker or even propose code modifications. In general, the more you
show your interest and motivation, the easier it is to find yourself as
a member of the team.

Some projects are of low activity or even inactive. In this case there
is no possibility to join an existing team, but it would rather be a
re-boot. If you feel eager to do this, please contact the general OWASP
administrators. It is however important that you are sure about the
commitment you are about to make.

Some things are important:

\- Don’t be shy. If you wish to be part of the OWASP initiative, you
will find a task that suits your experience and your level of possible
time investment.

\- Baby steps are easier than huge commitments. Just start helping with
small tasks and get known by the project team. You will grow into the
project in a natural way.

Please read more about the general project workflow on the
{{\#switchtablink:Starting_a_New_Project|Starting a New Project}}
page.

## OWASP Project Lifecycle

The OWASP Projects Lifecycle represents a balance between keeping a very
loose structure around OWASP projects, and ensuring that OWASP consumers
are not confused about a project’s maturity and quality. The lifecycle
stage allows consumers to easily identify mature projects, and projects
that are proofs of concept, experimental, and classified as prototypes
in their current state. The greater the maturity of the project, the
greater the level of responsibility for the project leader. These
responsibilities are not trivial as OWASP provides incentives and
benefits (Section 7) for projects who take on these added
responsibilities.

#### The OWASP Project Lifecycle is broken down into the following stages:

**Incubator Projects**: OWASP Incubator projects represent the
experimental playground where projects are still being designed, ideas
are still being proven, and development is still underway. The “OWASP
Incubator” label allows OWASP consumers to readily identify a project’s
maturity; moreover, the label allows project leaders to leverage the
OWASP name while their project is still maturing. OWASP Incubator
projects are given a place on the OWASP Projects Portal to leverage the
organizations' infrastructure, and establish their presence and project
history.

**Lab Projects**: OWASP Labs projects represent projects that have
produced a deliverable of significant value. Leaders of OWASP Labs
projects are expected to stand behind the quality of their projects as
these projects have matured to the point where they are accepted by a
significant portion of the OWASP community. While these projects are
typically not production ready, the OWASP community expects that an
OWASP Labs project leader is producing releases that are ready for
mainstream usage. OWASP Labs Projects are meant to be the collection of
established projects that have gained community support and acclaim by
undergoing the project review process.

**Flagship Projects**: The OWASP Flagship designation is given to
projects that have demonstrated superior maturity, established quality,
and strategic value to OWASP and application security as a whole.
Eligible projects are selected from the OWASP Labs project pool. This
selection process generally ensures that there is only one project of
each type covering any particular security space. OWASP Flagship
projects represent projects that are not only mature, but are also
projects that OWASP as an organization provides direct support to
maintaining. The core mission of OWASP is to make application security
visible and so as an organization, OWASP has a vested interest in the
success of its Flagship projects. Since Flagship projects have such high
visibility, these projects are expected to uphold the most stringent
requirements of all OWASP Projects.

**Code Projects**: OWASP code projects are very important for the cyber
security solutions. Because these projects are used to find out the
application security problems and try to solve those problems.

## OWASP Project Stage Benefits

This section outlines the benefits of starting an OWASP project, and the
benefits of being at each different stage in the projects lifecycle. In
my short time here at OWASP as the PM, I have had several potential
project leaders ask me what the benefits are of starting their project
with OWASP. Below is my proposal for each Stage’s benefits.

**Incubator**

  - Financial Donation Management Assistance
  - Project Review Support
  - WASPY Awards Nominations
  - OWASP OSS and OPT Participation
  - Opportunity to submit proposal: $500 for Development.
  - Community Engagement and Support
  - Recognition and visibility of being associated with the OWASP Brand.

**Labs**

  - All benefits given to Incubator Projects
  - Technical Writing Support
  - Graphic Design Support
  - Project Promotion Support
  - OWASP OSS and OPT: Preference

**Flagship**

  - All benefits given to Incubator & Labs Projects
  - Grant finding and proposal writing help
  - Yearly marketing plan development
  - OWASP OSS and OPT participation preference

For more detailed information on OWASP Project Stage Benefits, please
see the Project Handbook.

## Project Monitoring Incubator/Documentation

Every 6 months, a project monitoring assessment takes place to evaluate
if projects had any releases during this period.A warning will be sent
to projects without any activity in 90 days and after 180 days, the
project will be set automatically as inactive. You can set your project
active at any time, as long as:

  - There has been commits to the project's open repository or
  - There has been a beta release of the documentation produced so far
    or
  - Provide a detailed Roadmap

### Importance of a well thought out Roadmap

Many Incubator project leaders struggle with creating a realistic
planning, which should be based on their available resources and time. A
well thought out plan makes a difference between a procrastinating
project and a successful one. The important aspect of this is, that the
project leader is able to create a plan based on his situation. The
following is an example of a Roadmap, which has focused to produce a
Documentation first release in a year and a basic outline how they plan
to cover 4 essential aspects which are Research & Development,
Marketing, Planning and Goals.

Product
Roadmap](http://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-creating-agile-product-roadmap/)"

## Project Monitoring for LABS/Flagship

These project represent the best OWASP has to offer, therefore
monitoring of these projects is closely supervised.

### For Code and Tools

For projects holding Flagship status, we closely monitor their health
every 6 months on the following, among other key indicators:

  - Can the project be built correctly?
  - Does the project has any activity(commits) in the last 6 months?
  - Does the project had any releases in the last 6 months?
  - Has the project leaders updated his wiki or website to reflect
    latest releases?

### For Documentation

For this part, we are working on the development of an adequate
assessment criteria The following is a draft of the new process
proposal: [Proposal for Reviewing OWASP Document
projects](:File:Qualitative_and_Quantitative_Content_Audit.pdf "wikilink")

## OWASP Project Graduation

The Project Graduation Process is an optional process undertaken at the
request of a project leader using the Incubator Graduation Form. The
purpose of this process is to move a project from the OWASP Incubator
into the OWASP Labs. In order to be considered for OWASP Labs, an
Incubator project must have submitted an OWASP reviewed deliverable, and
obtained at least two (2) positive responses for each of the core
criteria project health questions.

The review centers around the following core questions. Each core
question has three (3) specific questions made up of binary queries. A
project must receive at least two (2) positive responses from each
reviewer in two of the binary questions, to warrant a postive response
for the core question. Each core question must receive a positive
response from both project reviewers to pass the Project Health
Assessment for Incubator Projects.

  - [Project Graduation Criteria
    Checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AllOCxlYdf1AdG5NZGhzTjZpT1RDcnRibjd0aXhfOUE)

To request graduation for your project please use the [Project
Graduation
Application](https://owasporg.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/7/create/71)

## OWASP Project Health Assessment

The Project Health Assessment is an optional process undertaken at the
request of a project leader when he/she applies for Project Graduation
for projects going from Incubator to LAB and from LAB to Flagship. The
purpose of this assessment is to determine whether a project meets the
minimum criteria of an OWASP Project outlined in the [Project Health
Assessment Criteria
Document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AllOCxlYdf1AdG5NZGhzTjZpT1RDcnRibjd0aXhfOUE).
If a project passes the assessment, it then becomes eligible to graduate
into the OWASP Labs Project stage. In order to be considered for OWASP
Labs, an Incubator project must have submitted an OWASP reviewed
deliverable, and obtained at least two (2) positive responses for each
of the core criteria project health questions.

## OWASP Project Deliverable/Release Assessment

The Project Deliverable/Release Review is an optional process undertaken
at the request of a project leader using the Project Deliverable Review
Form. The purpose of this process is to review a project’s progress, and
to make sure the project is heading in the right direction based on the
roadmap they provided at project inception.

Reviews must be performed by two (2) OWASP Chapter or Project Leaders,
and their review must answer affirmatively to at least the first two (2)
core Project Deliverable/Release Review questions. A project must pass
the OWASP Project Deliverable/Release Assessment in order to graduate
into the OWASP Labs Project stage.

## OWASP Project Infrastructure

  - **OWASP Project Lifecycle:** The OWASP Projects Lifecycle represents
    a balance between keeping a very loose structure around OWASP
    projects, and ensuring that OWASP consumers are not confused about a
    project’s maturity and quality. The lifecycle stage allows consumers
    to easily identify mature projects, and projects that are proofs of
    concept, experimental, and classified as prototypes in their current
    state.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Incubator Project:** OWASP Incubator projects represent the
    experimental playground where projects are still being fleshed out,
    ideas are still being proven, and development is still underway. The
    “OWASP Incubator” label allows OWASP consumers to readily identify a
    project’s maturity. The label also allows project leaders to
    leverage the OWASP name while their project is still maturing.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Labs Project:** OWASP Labs projects represent projects that have
    produced a deliverable of value. While these projects are typically
    not production ready, the OWASP community expects that an OWASP Labs
    project leader is producing releases that are at least ready for
    mainstream usage.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Flagship Project:** The OWASP Flagship designation is given to
    projects that have demonstrated strategic value to OWASP and
    application security as a whole.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Project Benefits:** The standard list of resources and incentives
    made available to project leaders based on their project's current
    maturity level.

## OWASP Project Reviews

  - **Project Reviews:** Project reviews are the method OWASP uses to
    establish a minimal baseline of project characteristics and release
    quality. Reviews are not mandatory, but they are necessary if a
    project leader wishes to graduate to the next level of maturity
    within the OWASP Global Projects infrastructure. Projects can be
    reviewed when an Incubator project wishes to graduate into the OWASP
    Labs designation, and project releases can be reviewed if they want
    the quality of their deliverable to be vouched for by OWASP.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Project Reviewer Pool:** The project reviewer pool is made up of
    veteran reviewers who have proven themselves dedicated to executing
    quality reviews of projects.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Project Graduation:** The Project Graduation Process is an
    optional process undertaken at the request of a project leader using
    the Incubator Graduation Form. The purpose of this process is to
    move a project from the OWASP Incubator into the OWASP Labs.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Project Health Assessment:** The Project Health Assessment is an
    optional process undertaken at the request of a project leader when
    he/she applies for Project Graduation The purpose of this assessment
    is to determine whether a project meets the minimum criteria of an
    OWASP Project outlined in the [Project Health Assessment Criteria
    Document](https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AllOCxlYdf1AdG5NZGhzTjZpT1RDcnRibjd0aXhfOUE#gid=1).

<!-- end list -->

  - **Project Release:** A project release refers to the final
    deliverable a project produces. It is the final product of the
    project.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Project Deliverable/Release Review:** The Project
    Deliverable/Release Review is an optional process undertaken at the
    request of a project leader using the Project Deliverable Review
    Form. The purpose of this process is to review a project’s progress,
    and to make sure the project is heading in the right direction based
    on the roadmap they provided at project inception.

## OWASP Projects Processes

  - **Project Processes:** The set of streamlined processes that exist
    to help projects move smoothly through the OWASP Project Lifecycle.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Project Inception Process:** The Project Inception Process is how
    a brand new idea becomes an OWASP Project. Such projects are labeled
    as OWASP Incubator projects. The process involves submitting the
    proposed project name, project leader information, project
    description, project roadmap, and selecting an appropriate
    open-source license for the project using the New Project Form on
    the Projects Portal.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Project Donation Process:** The Project Donation Process is used
    for a project that has an existing functional release, but is not
    currently associated with OWASP. This process is the primary
    mechanism by which individuals or organizations can transfer the
    ownership of their project’s copyright to OWASP.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Project Transition Process:** The Project Transition Process is
    used to transition leadership of a project to a new project leader.
    This is a simple automated process to transfer the relevant
    accounts, mailing lists, and other project resources to the new
    project leader.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Project Abandonment Process:** The Project Abandonment Process was
    put in place for those occasions in which a project leader is no
    longer able to manage their project, and has not been able to find a
    suitable replacement for the leader role. Project Abandonment can
    also occur when the project leader feels his/her project has become
    obsolete. Under these circumstances, the acting project leader is
    encourage do submit the Project Abandonment Form found in the
    Projects Portal.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Incubator Graduation Process:** The Incubator Graduation Process
    is an optional process undertaken at the request of a project leader
    using the Incubator Graduation Form. The purpose of this process is
    to move a project from the OWASP Incubator into the OWASP Labs.

## Projects at Conferences

  - **AppSec Conferences:** OWASP AppSec conferences bring together
    industry, government, security researchers, and practitioners to
    discuss the state of the art in application security. This series
    was launched in the United States in 2004 and Europe in 2005. Global
    AppSec conferences are held annually in North America, Latin
    America, Europe, and Asia Pacific.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Open Source Showcase:** The Open Source Showcase is an OWASP
    AppSec Conference event module designed to give Open Source project
    leaders the opportunity to demo their projects.

<!-- end list -->

  - **OWASP Project Track:** The OWASP Project Track is an OWASP AppSec
    Conference event module designed to give OWASP Project leaders the
    opportunity to showcase their projects as an official conference
    presenter.

## OWASP Projects General

  - **OWASP Code of Ethics:** The OWASP Code of Ethics are the set of
    guidelines and principles that the OWASP Foundation expects all of
    its members and conference attendees to abide by. A copy of the Code
    of Ethics can be found here in the [OWASP About
    page](About_The_Open_Web_Application_Security_Project#Code_of_Ethics "wikilink").

## Donate to OWASP Global Projects

OWASP Projects, a global division of the OWASP Foundation, is run under
the same world wide not-for-profit charitable status as all the
foundation strategic groups. OWASP provides a platform for contributors
to share their work while providing them with the project and community
support they need throughout their project development. All OWASP
Projects are run by volunteers and they rely on personal donations and
sponsorship to continue their development. Donate to OWASP Projects, and
we promise to spend your money wisely on open source initiatives.

**This is how your money can help:**

  - $20 could help us spread the word on the importance of open source
    initiatives in the Application Security industry.
  - $100 could help fund OWASP project demos at major conferences.
  - $250 could help get our volunteer Project Leaders to speaking
    engagements.

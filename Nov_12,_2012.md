  - $500 per chapter/project investment budget item for 2013 - Brennan

        only Flagship status projects should get $500 for Project
        Development Expenses.- Sam

    Manico
  - Remove all project leaders that have been on a project, initiative,
    committee but have done nothing (measurable) in the last 6 months
      - a good test is just to ask: 'Dear project leader XYX, what have
        you done for the project/initiative/committee ABC over the last
        6 months.'
      - see [The difference between being 'Appointed' and being
        'Accepted' as an OWASP Leader (of its
        Fork)](http://diniscruz.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/the-difference-between-being-appointed.html)

<p>There is a lack of standard performance metrics regarding the use of knowledge based authentication (KBA) for remote identity proofing. KBA-PMP's goal is to establish standard performance metrics for knowledge based authentication, following a transnational perspective.</p>

# News

## September 23, 2016

## Knowledge Based Authentication Performance Metrics Project (KBA-PMP) will be at AppSecUSA in Washington DC USA, October 11-14, 2016 for the OWASP Project Summit, for details see <https://2016.appsecusa.org>

## April 20, 2016

First draft is released on github. We are closing our Second Phase. Now
is time to Debug and test.

## Knowledge Based Authentication Performance Metrics (KBA-PMP) holds its first Project Summit in Amsterdam, Netherlands see <https://2015.appsec.eu/conference-program/> KBA-PMP and <https://2015.appsec.eu/project-summit/>.

# Talks

## May 21, 2015

## Co-Project Leaders Luis Enriquez and Ann Racuya-Robbins co-create a Lightning talk on the project's current essential features at the OWASP AppSec EU 2015 in Amsterdam, Netherlands. <https://2015.appsec.eu/conference-program/>

# Road Map - Time Line

OWASP KBA-PMP - Knowledge Based Authentication Performance Metrics
Project

Goals - To meet the requirements of the IDESG KBA Solicitation:

**KBA PROJECT PHASES** (PROPOSAL) Dear KBA collegues, we propose an
action plan divided in the following phases:

**FIRST PHASE: SCANNING THE MARKET** The goal of this first phase, is to
understand how KBA is working today (static and dynamic), and how KBA
methodologies have been implemented by KBA providers. I think this a
good departure point.

  - 1\. Footprinting the KBA market providers.
  - 2\. Identifying the KBA product providers used by the main market
    players.
  - 3\. Identifying the advantages and drawbacks of KBA provider's
    methodology.
  - 4\. Draw the document's structure.
      - Complete document structure v1
  - 5\. Initial Timeline
  - 5\. Launch Participant Outreach

**SECOND PHASE: DEVELOPMENT** Once the advantages and drawbacks of the
KBA market have been clearly identified, it would be necessary to have
our own platform for testing purposes. This will give us the right
perspective about developing a transnational, neutral, secure, and
market wise KBA standard. I would also suggest building an open wiki, to
get community feedback.

  - 1\. Setting an Application for KBA testing purposes.
  - 2\. Build an open wiki for community feedback.
  - 3\. Test the KBA proposals in our test application.
  - 4\. Analyzing the framework in crucial legal areas (such as Dynamic
    KBA and privacy).

**THIRD PHASE: EDITION** This phase is very important, as it concerns
the text edition. Once all proposals have being tested in our lab, we
should translate them into a clear document.

  - 1\. Edit the contents of the sources (sources such as the wiki).
  - 2\. Release the version 1.0. and license it under the terms of a
    suitable license.

Initial Overview

1.  Survey and research the Global OWASP Community and other networks to
    identify and recruit appropriate participation.
2.  Develop Opinion polls, foundations' research, interviews,
    perspectives on project, input from communities outside of the
    networks.
3.  Survey and research other standards groups and their interests.
4.  Phase I footprinting
5.  Phase II Development
6.  Phase III Implementation, Lessons Learned, Continuous refinement,
    Ongoing participation model, etc.
7.  Research Licensing models //

# FAQs

## How can I participate in your project?

All you have to do is make the Project Leader's aware of your available
time to contribute to the project. It is also important to let the
Leader's know how you would like to contribute and pitch in to help the
project meet it's goals and milestones. There are many different ways
you can contribute to an OWASP Project, but communication with the leads
is key.

## If I am not a programmer can I participate in your project?

Yes, you can certainly participate in the project if you are not a
programmer or technical. The project needs different skills and
expertise and different times during its development. Currently, we are
looking for researchers, writers, graphic designers, and a project
administrator.

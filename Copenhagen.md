### March 28th, 2019 [1](https://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Copenhagen-Chapter/events/258987408/)

**Title:** XSSER: From XSS to RCE 3.0

**Abstract:** This presentation demonstrates how an attacker can utilise
XSS to execute arbitrary code on the web server when an administrative
user inadvertently triggers a hidden XSS payload. Custom tools and
payloads integrated with Metasploit's Meterpreter in a highly automated
approach will be demonstrated live, including post-exploitation
scenarios and interesting data that can be obtained from compromised web
applications. This version includes more payloads for common web apps
and various other improvements too\!"

# Overview

In order to eliminate confusion and possible misinformation with regard
to which members at a particular @owasp.org address are staff and which
are not, it is necessary to differentiate staff email addresses from the
general community email addresses. This project will address the
necessary steps that staff need to take to enable their .com email
address and forward or transfer existing emails, calendars, and drive
files to the new .com identity. The various third party and supporting
sites that must also be changed over to the new identity will be covered
as well.

# Project Links

Though initially written to address the changeover to
@owaspfoundation.org, [this
document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1416zdTv5Jluzyo-U-BschVJazQYCe9ej7TFPPj8uyvY)
will be updated for @owasp.com

The OWASP Web Security Evaluation and Certification project is well
underway. In fact at this point in writing I intend to fully complete
the first draft by COB Friday September the 10th.

So far we have met the following milestones;

Defined the criteria for a good standard and set out key proposals for
consideration Defined the structure for a scaleable scheme and built the
generic framework Defined the generic controls for the technology
section Defined the generic controls for the process section

Left to do

Define controls for the people section Refine all controls

Configure all controls to create a reference implementation

There are several services companies already planning to offer services
around this project and several banks planning to adopt it for their 3rd
party security assessment criteria. This is very encouraging\!

**Professor Ian Angell**

Ian Angell has been Professor of Information Systems at the London
School of Economics since 1986. Prior to that he researched and taught
Computer Science at Royal Holloway College, and University College
London. Angell has very radical and constructive views on his subject,
and is very critical of what he calls the pseudo-science of academic
Information Systems. He has gained a certain notoriety worldwide for his
aggressive polemics against the inappropriate use of artificial
intelligence and so-called knowledge management, and against the
hyperbole surrounding e-commerce.
His main research work concentrates on organizational and national I.T.
policies, on strategic information systems, and on computers and risk
(both opportunities and hazards), particularly the systemic risks
inherent in all socio-technical systems and the security threats posed
to organisations by the rapidly diffusing international information
infrastructure.

## Achilles’ heel – Hacking Through Java Protocols

Web applications normally use clear HTTP protocols to communicate, and
can be manipulated with interception proxies such as Achilles, WebScarab
and Paros. However, many modern applications utilize thick clients (such
as applets) which are based on binary protocols that cannot be easily
manipulated in such methods.

In this lecture we will present techniques for manipulating such
applications, including new techniques for live manipulation of Java
serialized protocols, allowing the tester to overcome many of the
obstacles associated with the testing of such applications.

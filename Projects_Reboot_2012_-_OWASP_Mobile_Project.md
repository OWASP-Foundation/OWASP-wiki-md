**Mobile project is requesting funding for:**

1\) **Project Name and Description** OWASP Mobile Security Project
The project is a centralized set of resources intended to give
developers and security teams the tools they need to build and maintain
secure mobile applications. Through the project, our goal is to increase
awareness of security issues and provide the knowledge and tools needed
to solve these problems.
2\) **Reboot Initiatives**
Type 2- Community Liaison (3k)
While the professionals within the security industry have a wealth of
talent and knowledge to contribute to the mobile initiative, the
academic community remains largely untapped for its potential input.
Additionally, there are many valuable research initiatives that exist
within the private and government spaces that could greatly enhance the
project's ability to fulfill its mission. The challenge is bringing
interested parties together and raising their awareness of the project's
mission.
The project is requesting funds for a community liaison that will serve
the purpose of reaching out to parties of interest in order to recruit
them as contributors. The liaison will be responsible for identifying
research initiatives that align with the project's mission, and opening
communication channels between existing core contributors and potential
contributors of interest.
This individual’s deliverable requirements will be:
Informational and brochure-ware for interested contributors, explaining
the project’s mission and the value in involvement or contributions.
Marketing and communications with potential contributing entities
Identify mobile development centric groups to form collaborative
partnerships with Type 1 and Type 2- Mobile Security Hackathon Style
Event/Summit (Approximately 10k, with the rest via sponsorship and small
entrance fee/donation...any excess funds would go back to OWASP as well
as a percentage earmarked for the mobile security project)
The majority of the mobile project team is regionally diverse, and
typically performs work using online collaborative tools (Google Docs,
Skype, WebEx, etc.). While this enables the team to achieve great things
from a distance, at times it can be challenging to sync everyone's
schedules to achieve great things in tandem. Work and life related
distractions often make it challenging to make fast or consistent
progress on producing consumable material.
The project is requesting funds to hold a small event within the next
3-4 months. Limited sponsorship could also be obtained in order to
increase the available amount of funds.
As this would be a “hackathon” style of event, attendees would be
encouraged to attend in order to build upon existing ideas while in the
presence of other skilled peers. This includes new tools, proof of
concept libraries, case studies, and ideas for new written materials.
In order to fund this, the project would require the following:
paid airfare and hotel for 5-10 core contributors
a small venue for 25-30 attendees, or more if the interest level
supports it (will look into Makerspace type of venues)
assistance with marketing and promotion for the event
Aside from the promotional aspects that would greatly benefit the
project, the contributors that would have their expenses paid will have
a clear mission and deliverable items to achieve while onsite. These
items will be completed through hackathons and rapid-fire collaborative
efforts. Both core contributors and general summit attendees will be
able to participate and collaborate, further increasing the number of
active project contributors and helping to forge new relationships.

**The required (minimum) deliverables to be produced include**:
**draft updated Top 10 Risks**
**draft updated Controls**
**draft secure mobile development framework (outline)**

As the mobile development community is growing at an incredibly fast
pace, this represents a completely new audience for OWASP to engage.
Developers and researchers would be more likely to attend this style of
event, as they can provide immediate value as well as learn from their
peers through hands-on activities and face-to-face collaboration.

**Type 1-** Professionally Designed and Prepared Documents (3k)
While the project has produced several deliverables of reasonable
quality, they lack the polish and refinement of other high profile OWASP
documents such as the Web Top 10. In order to encourage further
dissemination and adoption of this material, it is essential to revamp
these documents in a format suitable to send to a CIO or CSO level
leader.
Currently, the Mobile Top 10 Risks and Controls are preparing to enter a
period of revision and content enhancements. These enhancements will
result in fresh material that should be disseminated in a timely manner
to a broad audience.
The project is requesting funds in order to contract out to a graphic
artist and technical writer the deliverable task of converting these
artifacts into professional, high quality documents. The designer will
be tasked with creating visuals and amplifying graphics that enhance the
message contained within the materials. The technical writer would be
responsible for ensuring the accuracy, quality, and general structure of
the documentation. This will help tremendously with attracting a larger
audience for consuming these materials as well as industry adoption.
The updated documents the project would desire to see in high quality
format include:
**Mobile Top 10 Risks**
**Mobile Top 10 Controls** (in collaboration with ENISA:
<http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/application-security/smartphone-security-1/smartphone-secure-development-guidelines>)
3\) **Goals**
Review, update and expand the material surrounding the Mobile Risks and
Controls
Complete the outline for the secure mobile development framework, making
it possible for contributors to participate in a simplified, modular
manner Increase the number of high quality, active contributors to the
mobile security project
Create new initiatives and sub-projects to build within the overall
project to complement existing work Host an event that brings together
new and existing contributors to accelerate progress with generating
content

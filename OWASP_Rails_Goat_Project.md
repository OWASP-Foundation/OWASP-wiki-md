Railsgoat is a vulnerable version of the Ruby on Rails Framework and
includes vulnerabilities from the OWASP Top 10, as well as some "extras"
the initial project contributors felt worthwhile to share. This project
is designed to educate both developers as well as security
professionals. More information can be found at the "Unofficial" project
site, listed below.

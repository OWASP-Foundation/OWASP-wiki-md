## How does the scanner work ?

1\. First HEAD Check if a vulnerable resource exists rather than GET
request and search vulnerable string. This speeds up the process. It is
good to minimize IDS alert as it doesn't send GET storm attack strings
Request.

2\. Only if the resource exists, then it checks if the vulnerability
exists with sample exploit string.

3\. If the exploit string is not available, it works out the
vulnerability state with version deduced.

## Open GIC Action Items

Future of the GIC: proposed transition of the GIC to the GIAB: proposed
shut down of all committees, requires us to find and define a new
vehicle that will look after the tasks of the former GIC. The proposal
is that this would be the Global Industry Advisory Board (GIAB).

## Next Meeting

as the GIC will be shut down end of March and possibly a new entity will
take over most of its duties, this will probably be the last meeting of
the GIC

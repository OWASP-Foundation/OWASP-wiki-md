OWASP is an open source, non-profit organization. While our activities
are free for all, we do have costs, and need your help to make our
activities better.
We are also open to any other non-financial sponsorship ideas that you
may have. These are some simple ways in which you can help us:

## Commercial Sponsoring an OWASP IL conference

<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>OWASP Israel chapter hosts a Regional Conference once a year, usually in September or October. This year, we are holding the Conference in partnership with the School of Computer Science at the College of Management, in Rishon, Israel. <a href="Israel#Previous_OWASP_Israel_Conferences_and_Meetings" title="wikilink">These conferences</a> are always very successful and a large number of people attend.</p>
<p>We encourage companies to sponsor our conferences and help pay for such expenses such as refreshments, photography, video etc. The conferences are not commercial and the cost goes directly to cover expenses. Since the conferences draw an increasingly large number of people, our expenses are also rising accordingly.</p>
<p>If you or your company benefits from OWASP materials and/or conferences, we encourage you to support us! Moreover, the associated publicity and community goodwill can go a long way. We have several levels of sponsorship available, appropriate for the different organizations that wish to support our activities. Of course, if you are a Corporate Member of OWASP (at any level) and allocate a percentage (20-40%) of your membership fees to the Israel chapter, we can consider those funds as conference sponsorship. It is also possible to be creative and find non-financial ways to support us and contribute to the successful running of the conference. (If you have any other ideas please contact <a href="mailto:avi.douglen@owasp.org">AviD</a> directly.</p>
<p><strong>Past sponsors include Check Point, Microsoft, F5, IBM, Ernst &amp; Young, Checkmarx, Imperva, Quotium, Akamai, Synopsys and many others</strong></p></td>

<!-- end list -->

  - A lecture for money. The conference program is strictly selected on

### What We Need Your Money For

OWASP is very strictly not-for-profit. We use the sponsorship funds to
help make our events even more compelling to the audience while striving
to make them free for participants. We want more people to come to our
events so we can educate them about making applications more secure.

We use the money collected from sponsors for things such as:

  - **Lecture videos** - recording presentations enables them to be
    available also to people who cannot make it to the conference, and
    further publicize the contents of the event.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Venue costs** - this year's conference is being hosted in
    partnership with the College of Management, so we have minimal
    direct costs for use of the halls. However there are additional
    associated costs, for some of the involved logistics such as hiring
    required equipment.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Refreshments** - we want to keep people a long time, and we
    certainly bring good and interesting speakers, yet we don't want
    people to go home when they become hungry.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Name tags** - we feel that professional networking and getting to
    know each other is an important facet of the community, and name
    tags make this easier.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Promotion** - Till now, our events are publicized mostly by word
    of mouth. We would like to get to a wider audience by advertising
    our events.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Printed Materials** - We are not very keen on killing trees, but
    some people learn more from actual printed paper. We would like to
    hand out certain printed materials in our conferences.

By the way, if you feel that you can contribute to any of these in
anyway besides money, we will be happy to hear about it.

### What Should You Prepare as a Sponsor

As a sponsor, you are not obliged to do anything. Sponsorship can be a
philanthropy. However, in order to take advantage of the benefits listed
above, we recommend the following:

  - Send us a logo file to put on the conference web page. (Note the
    maximum logo size according to the sponsorship level).

<!-- end list -->

  - Prepare a roll-up type poster or equivalent for your table top
    booth.

<!-- end list -->

  - Prepare brochures for handling out to conference attendees.

<!-- end list -->

  - You might also want to hold a sweepstake between people who fill in
    their details in order to collect leads. We will be happy to
    announce the prize on the conference page.

<!-- end list -->

  - Come 30 minutes before the conference starts to setup your booth.

## Not-for-Profit / Barter Sponsorship of OWASP IL Conferences

We are happy to allow any information security related not-for-profit
organization to present at our conference expo. You will get, for free,
the same benefits that the commercial vendors get. The only condition is
that if you hold similar events we would like to present at those events
in return.

We extend the same type of barter to commercial organizations that hold
events. If you organize an information security related event, we would
let you promote it in our expo in return for having presence in your
event.

Contact [AviD](mailto:avi.douglen@owasp.org) for further details.

## Hosting a meeting

We also host regular meetings and look for companies to host or sponsor
these meetings. A company that hosts such a meeting is responsible for a
meeting location and the refreshments. We need a room that can host at
least 150 people. Pizza and drinks are the common refreshments, but
alternatives are also OK. Keep in mind that food should be Kosher.

If you want to host such a meeting, contact
[AviD](mailto:avi.douglen@owasp.org).

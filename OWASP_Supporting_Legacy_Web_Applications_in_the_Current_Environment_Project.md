Legacy systems are everywhere. The security of these applications need
to come into focus, mainly in the space of financial sector. This is
because the impact of the known and discovered vulnerabilities in this
area stand to lose a lot in terms of reputation, client base, user base
and money. This apart from the legal implications. This particular
project will focus on supporting legacy web applications in financial
sector and will not consider any other sectors in scope.

# Project About

This project will focus on listing down legacy technologies,
applications that typically use these technologies, space of usage of
these technologies, and their known vulnerabilities.

The next step would then list down remediation of these vulnerabilities
and / or compensating controls such that it can be used as a cheat sheet
that can be used by organisations that actualy have legacy technologies
as a part of their organisation.

**This is an initiative jointly led by the [Global Conferences
Committee](Global_Conferences_Committee "wikilink") and the [Global
Projects Committee](Global_Projects_Committee "wikilink")**

The OWASP Speakers group is an initiative to create a pool of OWASP
project/initiative leaders with important projects and great
presentation skills who can be drawn from to present on behalf of the
organization at OWASP and non-OWASP events worldwide. The GCC will work
with the event planners to determine the number of speaking slots for a
particular event, and the GCC/GPC will select presenters from the
Speakers group based on availability for that event. Members of the
OWASP Speakers group are expected to present at least once in any
calendar year (starting in 2012) and may resign at any time. As these
speakers will be representing OWASP, presentation skills will be a large
factor in selection and the GCC/GPC will review speaker feedback
provided by event attendees to ensure speaker quality. Individuals that
do not participate in the OWASP Track may still apply for membership in
the OWASP Speakers group, though we will expect to see video of previous
presentations to determine quality.

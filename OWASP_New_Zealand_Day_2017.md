# Call For Presentations

## Call For Presentations

**Thank you to all those who have submitted talks. The call for
presentations has now closed.**

OWASP New Zealand Day conferences attract a high quality of speakers
from a variety of security disciplines including architects, web
developers and engineers, system administrators, penetration testers,
policy specialists and more.

We would like a variety of technical levels in the presentations
submitted, corresponding to the three sections of the conference:

  - Introductions to various Web Application Security topics, and the
    OWASP projects
  - Technical topics
  - Policy, Compliance and Risk Management

The introductory talks should appeal to an intermediate to experienced
web developer, without a solid grounding in web application security or
knowledge of the OWASP projects. These talks should be engaging,
encourage developers to learn more about web application security, and
give them techniques that they can immediately return to work and apply
to their jobs.

Technical topics are running all day and should appeal to two audiences
- experienced web application security testers or researchers, and web
developers who have a “OWASP Top Ten” level of understanding of web
attacks and defenses. You could present a lightning, short or long talk
on something you have researched, developed yourself, or learnt in your
travels. Ideally the topics will have technical depth or novelty so that
the majority of attendees learn something new.

We would also like to invite talks that will appeal to those interested
in the various non-technical topics that are important in our industry.
These talks could focus on the development of policies, dealing with
compliance obligations, managing risks within an enterprise, or other
issues that could appeal to those in management roles.

We encourage presentations to have a strong component on fixing and
prevention of security issues. We are looking for presentations on a
wide variety of security topics, including but not limited to:

  - Web application security
  - Mobile security
  - Secure development
  - Vulnerability analysis
  - Threat modelling
  - Application exploitation
  - Exploitation techniques
  - Threat and vulnerability countermeasures
  - Platform or language security (JavaScript, NodeJS, .NET, Java, RoR,
    etc)
  - Penetration Testing
  - Browser and client security
  - Application and solution architecture security
  - PCI DSS
  - Risk management
  - Security concepts for C\*Os, project managers and other
    non-technical attendees
  - Privacy controls

\-- The email subject must be "OWASP New Zealand 2017: CFP" and the
email body must contain the following information/sections:

  - Name and Surname
  - Affiliation
  - Telephone number
  - Email address
  - Short presenter bio
  - Title of the contribution
  - Type of contribution: Technical, Informative, Management
  - Suggested length for the talk
  - Short abstract (up to 500 words)
  - List of the author's previous papers/articles/speeches on the
    same/similar topic (if any)
  - If you are not from New Zealand, will your company support your
    travel/accommodation costs? - Yes/No

\--\>

The submission will be reviewed by the OWASP New Zealand Day conference
committee and the highest voted talks will be selected and invited for
presentation.

PLEASE NOTE:

  - Due to limited budget available, expenses for international speakers
    cannot be covered.
  - If your company is willing to cover travel and accommodation costs,
    the company will become "Support Sponsor" of the event.

**Thank you to all those who have submitted talks. The call for
presentations has now closed.**

Please submit your presentation
[here](https://www.papercall.io/owaspnz2017).

\-- Please submit the above information to all of the following: Denis

# Call For Sponsorships

## Call For Sponsorships

**Thank you to all our sponsors. Sponsorship has now been fully
subscribed, we are no longer accepting new sponsors.**

OWASP New Zealand Day 2017 will be held in Auckland on the 20th of
April, 2017 and is a security conference entirely dedicated to
application security. The conference is once again being hosted by the
University of Auckland with their support and assistance. OWASP New
Zealand Day 2017 is a free event, but requires sponsor support to help
be an instructive and quality event for the New Zealand community. OWASP
is strictly not for profit. The sponsorship money will be used to help
make OWASP New Zealand Day 2017 a free, compelling, and valuable
experience for all attendees.

The sponsorship funds collected are to be used for things such as:

  - Name tags - we feel that getting to know people within the New
    Zealand community is important, and name tags make that possible.
  - Promotion - up to now our events are propagating by word of mouth.
    We would like to get to a wider audience by advertising our events.
  - Printed Materials - printed materials will include brochures, tags
    and lanyards.

## Facts

Last year, the event was supported by nine sponsors and attracted more
than 500 participants. Plenty of constructive (and positive\!) feedback
from the audience was received and we are using this to make the
conference more appealing to more people. For more information on the
last New Zealand Day event, please visit:
<https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2016>

The OWASP New Zealand community is strong, there are more than 490
people currently subscribed to the mailing-list. OWASP New Zealand Day
is expected to attract between 500 and 600 attendees this year.

OWASP regular attendees are IT project managers, IT security managers,
IT security consultants, web application architects and developers, QA
managers, QA testers and system administrators.

There are three different levels of sponsorships for the OWASP Day
event:

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

This is OWASP Day, let’s recap the top 10 from 2013 for those in the
room that might not know or need a refresher. But hey it’s 2017 where
are we at now? Let’s look at analyse the data collected from the 2016
data call.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Kevin helps run the Christchurch branch of ISIG. He has been programming
for a living since 1986 (yes, longer than most of you have been alive)
after studying at what is now known as Ara Institute of Canterbury. In

### Kate Pearce - Cisco - Gaslighting with Honeypits and Mirages: Destroying discovery to deplete attackers

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

Abstract (Small): When an attacker is after you they need a way in, and
to prioritize efforts. Defensive gaslighting makes them chase ghost
systems, and attack phantom vulnerabilities - keeping you secure. As we
discussed last time, we may release tools, and we may discuss some
theory, but are you sure that really happened?

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Catherine (Kate) Pearce is a Senior Security Consultant for Cisco, who
is based in Wellington, New Zealand. Formerly a Security Consultant for
Neohapsis in the USA, she has engaged with a widespread and varied range
of clients to assist them in understanding their current security state,
adding resilience into their systems and processes, and managing their
ongoing security risk. Day-to-day she undertakes a mix of advising
clients around their security, client-focused security assessments (such
as penetration tests), and security research. She has spoken at her work
at many security conferences, including Black Hat USA, Source Boston,
Nolacon, Kiwicon, ACSC, Bsides Canberra and many others. While she has
recently presented on Network Security, her true loves are application
security enablement, complex systems security, and cross-discipline
security analogues.

software company named Xero. He joined in 2014 and his day job involves
securing and breaking internally developed products. Before Xero he
spent his previous years as a developer, and has been dabbling in the
information security scene in Wellington.

### Tom Eastman - The dangerous, exquisite art of safely handling user-uploaded files

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

“Come On, What Harm Can a User Profile photo Do?”.

I’ll show you every scary thing I know about that can be done with a
file upload, and how to protect yourself from – hopefully – most of
them.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Tom Eastman writes words that control computers to tell other computers
to build FAKE computers that run on DIFFERENT computers.

### Nick Malcolm - SafeStack - How to spot and stop a wolf in sheep's clothing (a.k.a Account Takeover)

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

Almost two thirds of confirmed breaches involve using weak or stolen
passwords - it’s not a new threat, but it works. By the end of this talk
you will understand the Account Takeover threat, and walk away with some
techniques & tools for detection and response within your own web
applications.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Nick Malcolm is a Security Consultant at SafeStack, which means he gets
to help people develop more secure software\! He works with awesome
people, in Auckland, New Zealand. He was formerly CTO at ThisData, a
security product which protected millions of websites from account
takeover attacks.

He’s also an active member in the Ruby community, regularly speaking
about coding and security. He is a member of OWASP NZ, ISIG (Info Sec
Interest Group), CSA (Cloud Security Alliance), and Internet NZ.

When he’s not coding he’s probably watching some scifi, spending time
with his wife and kid, patting his cat, or strummin’ on his guitar.

### Matt Cotterell - Fairfax Media - Building the ultimate login and signup

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

Web Applications have lots of quirks and limitations that set them apart
from other kinds of applications. In this talk, we explore public facing
login and registration flows and some of those quirks that can catch
devs out which can open your application (or users\!) to security or
privacy risks.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Matt Cotterell is a Security Engineer and a .NET Developer with 5+ years
professional experience in software engineering for various diverse
industries, including healthcare, cinema management and journalism. He
is more of a maker than a breaker and spends his time exploring various
software frameworks and public cloud providers (particularly .NET and
Azure) along with writing software and presentations that enable
developers to secure these systems.

writing biographies in a third-person perspective.

### Daniel Compton - Security on a shoestring - running a security critical service as a volunteer

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

Clojars is a JAR hosting service for the Clojure community. It’s a
security critical piece of infrastructure for many organisations. This
talk discusses my joining Clojars, how we improved our security, and how
you can do the same, especially if you’re at a non-profit or a
volunteer.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

he is a security consultant for Lateral Security, by night he tries to
remember what sleep is.

### Trev H - RedShield - Confession of a lactose intolerant vulnerability hunter

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

Eating cheese is delicious but if your body can’t process lactose (like
mine) you are in for trouble. On those late, dairy induced nights where
sleep just won’t happen, I’ll spend time developing an idea for an
automated mass scan tool - “fon-didly-do”. This tool could collate
vulnerability data collected from open Github projects and run analytics
on them. This tool could be useful in identifying vulnerability trends
for certain project types and platforms. I could write this tool using a
combination of Postgres, Elixir and any number of free static code
analysis tools.

This looks like a lot of work, but as luck would I have it … I have a
fridge full of beer, some crusty bread and a wheel of gorgonzola, lets
get to work\!

There will be a release of fon-didly-do, a demo and some live cheese
during this talk.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Trev is a RedShield Developer and Security Researcher who should not eat
cheese\! His daily job is to help secure web applications used by
hundreds of thousands of people across the globe. He enjoys cooking,
blues guitar and being a professional developer.

### Jen Zajac - Catalyst - Sensible defaults for client-side security

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

When starting a new web project, what foundations should you lay to
ensure your JavaScript, HTML and CSS is going to be secure? Thinking
about CSP, session token storage, how much you can trust a given input
early can save a lot of rework later\!

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Jen is the lead front-end developer at Catalyst, a development company
with a strong focus on Open Source. Based in Wellington, New Zealand,
Jen is originally from the UK but ended up in NZ working for a
conservation charity and ended up sticking around. With 10 years of
experience in the tech industry, Jen is the co-director of Kiwi PyCon
2014 and the director of nz.js(con); 2017.

### Matthew Daley - Aura Information Security - Huzzer, the tree-based generational mutating HTTP fuzzer

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

Webapp fuzzing is well-covered by tools such as Zed Attack Proxy or Burp
Suite, but what about the underlying webservers? Huzzer is a tree-based,
generational mutating fuzzer for HTTP that targets webservers. I’ll talk
about its development and some vulnerabilities found in real world
webservers.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Senior Security Consultant at Aura Information Security and general
weirdo in real life. Finds vulnerabilities in hypervisors, servers,
webapps, and front doors.

### Shahn Harris - Equifax - Changing Perspectives

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

I will share 10 techniques on how you change companies perspectives on
what information security is, and how it should be handled. These tips
do not involve executive buy in, metrics, risk assessments, budget and
without anyone knowing what you are actually doing.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Shahn Harris has spent many years working inside businesses of carious
sizes in many different capacities. This has resulted in him changing
from average tech guy to a beautiful butterfly of business engagement,
stakeholder management, strategic product alignment, future states, and
whatever other business jargon you can think of. He has worked across a
number of leading New Zealand institutes, organisation’s and, brands
spanning multiple industries as an internal resource or as a consultant.

### Adrian Hayes - Root Cause is the Best Cause

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

This talk will explore web app security flaws at the source code level
at find the patterns and anti-patterns that lead to vulnerabilities. If
you’re a developer you’ll learn how to write more secure code, and if
you’re a pentester you’ll learn some root causes and where to focus your
efforts.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Adrian Hayes has twelve years experience in the IT industry specialising
in both software development and IT security. He has consulted on
security for some of the largest organisations in the financial,
government, telecommunications, and education sectors across New Zealand
and internationally. Adrian has been known to speak at various security
events including Kiwicon, OWASP NZ Day, ISACA education days, and OWASP
Asia AppSec. He has published security research in the IEEE Security and
Privacy magazine, and has been invited to speak on wider IT issues on
Radio NZ.

### Grace Nolan and Catherine McIlvride - Enable Ltd and Assurity - 30 Days (ish) of Security

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

What is it like to learn security as complete beginner? What is is like
to teach a complete beginner? Where would you start? This talk is about
what it’s like learning security as a complete beginner.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Grace has been pressing buttons on computers her whole life. The right
buttons and the wrong buttons. Now she presses buttons for a living.
She’s currently a systems developer for Enable Ltd, a fibre broadband
company in Christchurch, which sounds terrifyingly adult on paper. She
cares about Computer Science in schools and Women in Tech stuff. She’s
an enthusiastic choral singer, tea fanatic, and paints watercolours when
she’s not devouring the latest in tech news.

Catherine is a Software Tester from Assurity. Her role is to gently
bring developers back down to earth by methodically exposing their bugs.
She laughs kindly at their dismay. She is a woman to be celebrated and
feared. Wanting to discover new challenges, Cat is learning about
security in the hopes of finding even better, juicier bugs.

good knowledge of JavaScript as well, and have explored a variety of
open source technologies and programming languages. Since 2016 I’m
working full time as a security consultant for Aura Information
Security, mainly performing penetration tests for web and mobile
applications.

### Lukas Weichselbaum & Michele Spagnuolo - Google Switzerland - So we broke all CSPs... You won't guess what happened next\!

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

Last year we proved that the whitelist-based approach of Content
Security Policy (CSP) is flawed and proposed an alternative based on
'strict-dynamic' in combination with nonces or hashes.

In our academic paper (CSP Is Dead, Long Live CSP\! On the Insecurity of
Whitelists and the Future of Content Security Policy, ACM CCS, 2016), we
demonstrated, using automatic checks, that 94.72% of all real-world
policies can be trivially bypassed by an attacker with an XSS bug, and
75.81% are bypassable due to whitelists.

Thanks to the new 'strict-dynamic' approach, we were finally able to
deploy an effective policy to many important Google products, such as
GMail, Photos, and others. In this presentation we would like to share
our experience, show examples, best practices and common pitfalls.

Finally, we share how we are addressing the recent bypasses of
nonce-based policies, such as nonce exfiltration/reuse techniques and
dangling markup attacks.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Lukas Weichselbaum is an Information Security Researcher at Google
focusing on security enhancements and mitigations for web applications.
He co-authored the specification for ‘strict-dynamic’ in CSP3 and
launched CSP-Evaluator (csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com), a tool for
developers and security experts to check if a Content Security Policy
serves as a strong mitigation against cross-site scripting attacks.
Lukas previously worked on dynamic analysis of Android malware. He also
founded Andrubis – one of the very first large scale malware analysis
platforms for Android applications.

Michele Spagnuolo is an Information Security Engineer at Google focusing
on security enhancements and mitigations for web applications. He
co-authored the specification for ‘strict-dynamic’ in CSP3, serving as a
strong mitigation against cross-site scripting attacks. Other works
include Rosetta Flash (rosettaflash.com) and BitIodine (bitiodine.net).

### Peter Chestna - Veracode - AppSec in a DevOps World

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

Dev teams were already struggling with adding security to their Agile
processes. DevOps teams are pushing to release continuously, meaning
integrating security will become even more of a challenge. How can teams
deliver secure code while maintaining the speed required in a DevOps
world?

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

As Director of Developer Engagement at Veracode, Pete provides customers
with practical advice on how to successfully roll out developer-centric
application security programs. Relying on more than 10 years of direct
AppSec experience as both a developer and development leader, Pete
provides information on best practices amassed from working with
Veracode’s 1,000+ customers.

Pete joined Veracode in 2006 as a software developer and was
instrumental in delivering the first version of Veracode’s service to
customers. Later, as Director of Platform Engineering, Pete built and
managed the Agile teams responsible for delivering Veracode’s SaaS
platform. He also built the first DevOps team to deliver microservices.
He is a certified product owner and scrum master. Pete also spearheaded
Veracode’s initiative to automate the use of Veracode products into the
company’s development processes called project Purina. Using this
experience, he has spoken with hundreds of Veracode customers to help
them set up similar programs.

Pete has more than 25 years’ experience developing software and has been
granted 3 patents. He has been developing web applications since 1996,
including one of the first applications to be delivered through a web
interface. In his spare time he enjoys listening to Rush, drinking
whiskey and programming on the Arduino platform.

### Ruth McDavitt - Summer of Tech - Hacking the Talent Pipeline

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

How can we join together to creatively overcome the limitations of our
current education & recruitment systems to achieve a better talent
pipeline? It’s recognised as a massive barrier, so what can we do about
it today, to grow the talent pool right now, and for the future?

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Ruth works on the human side of the technology industry, leading the
Summer of Tech programme that is addressing the shortage of NZ
technology skills through connecting experienced industry mentors with
students. She is an active mentor to young entrepreneurs in a variety of
programmes, including incubators, accelerators, universities, within
community groups and at high schools.

### Sam Macleod - SafeStack - Trust me, I'm a cloud

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

As the cloud continues to take over every part of our lives, chances are
that most of our systems and applications look quite different today
than they used to. I will be talking about some of the Business
Continuity pitfalls that are common in cloud environments, and how we
can weather the storm.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Sam comes from an operations background, with experience in
infrastructure design, incident response, and policy writing and
implementation.  Working with financial applications, he has extensive
experience in creating and working with high security environments.

### Charlie Gavey - Snapper Services - Conscious Incompetence: Started from the bottom, now we're here

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

Feeling like your organisation isn’t getting anywhere with security? The
realisation that you don’t know anything is actually a critical part of
the process. Described as the “conscious competence model”, this talk
discusses how being conscious of your own incompetence is an important
first step.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

As a Scrum Master and Product Owner at Snapper Services, I’m all about
empowering agile teams, with an interest in how agile teams mature and
scale. I’m enthusiastic about fostering the next generation of tech
talent; working with PC4G, RailsGirls, Cultivate Mentoring, and Summer
of Tech. Will tramp for scroggin.

### Alex Hogue - Atlassian - Graphing when your Facebook friends are awake

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

We’re going to talk about finding this weird bug/feature,
reverse-engineering what it does, actually looking at the graphs of
real-life humans, using it in a social engineering context, how to
prevent it, and tips for applying to work at the NSA.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Alex is a kid with a laptop and a pocketful of memes. Critics have
described him as “aggressively wonky”. As far as he can tell from
carefully examining the smoking crater that is his life, he’s working in
Incident Response at Atlassian, which is a little bit like being an
adult but with more ice cream. He does magic tricks and makes dumb
one-use novelty websites as a substitude for getting out more.

### Erica Anderson - The Magical World of Cloud Security

-----

<b>Abstract</b>

Before you can get to a web app, your request usually goes through a few
different levels of security infrastructure. This talk will focus on
common tools and technology used at the host and platform level, why
they are used, and which ones are full of fairy dust.

<b>Speaker Bio</b>

Her twitter bio says “info sec, cat, and ketchup enthusiast”. This story
checks out.

# Diversity fund

## Diversity and Financial Aid fund

\[We have unashamedly followed the model adopted by the nz.js(con) team
with their fund. Many thanks to Jen and the team\!\]

Due to the support of our lovely sponsors, we have some additional
funding available to help people from around New Zealand attend the
OWASP NZ Day that would find it hard to otherwise attend. In particular,
we welcome applications from women, people of colour, LGBTIQ and all
others. You all deserve to be able to learn more about security, and
we’ll do our darndest to help make that happen\!

Our funds are limited, and we’ll be reviewing applications every two
weeks. Submit your applications soon, so we can approve them early and
you’ll be in several review cycles\!

Process:

  - Fill out our [application
    form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfgj4k8PzOiZpA5KunjhaEpHPQUP31mqwcESfDlEMP2odTZFg/viewform?usp=sf_link)
  - We will review and approve applications each two weeks. The next
    review date is 12 April 2017.
  - We will contact all applicants and let them know the result of the
    review.
  - Successful applicants will be contacted to help sort things out.

We use the following criteria to help us decide who gets approved:

  - We are biased towards (but not exclusively for) diverse applicants.
  - We do attempt to maximise cost efficiency and will aim to get as
    many people to OWASP with our limited funds.

Each successful recipient can choose whether to be kept anonymous (in
which case only the OWASP NZ committee will know the details of your
funding), or to be put in touch with the supporting company whose
sponsorship is going towards your attendance. We think some of our
sponsors may enjoy the opportunity to chat with you on the day talk
about your experiences and plans for the future, but that’s totally
optional and up to you.

If you have any questions, feel free to drop us an email:
denis.andzakovic@owasp.org | kirk.jackson@owasp.org |
kim.carter@owasp.org

# Code of Conduct

## Code of Conduct

We want to make the OWASP NZ Day a welcoming environment for all
attendees. To that end, we would like to remind you of OWASP's
anti-harassment policy:
[1](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Governance/Conference_Policies).

Speakers, trainers and sponsors have all been reminded of these
policies, and are expected to abide by them like all attendees.

If you have any concerns during the day, please seek out Kirk, Denis or
Kim. We will make ourselves visible at the start of the day so you know
what we look like.

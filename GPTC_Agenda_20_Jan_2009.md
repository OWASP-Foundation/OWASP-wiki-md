## Agenda for Global Projects & Tools Committee on 20 Jan 2009

Old Business

  -   - A follow-up on what was done over the results from our first and
        second meetings.

New Business

  - Establish a Idea Catcher to track the results of the meetings and
    publish them to the wiki for the next meeting.
  - Establish the dates/times for monthly committee meetings
    (skype/conf. call other...)
  - Membership Committee had a written proposal that was approved by the
    Board and is now being implemented.
    <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership> how can the adjustment
    be of value for Global Tools (heheh) and should "Supporters" be able
    to sponsor projects?
  - Does everyone agree with this process?
    <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/How_to_Start_an_OWASP_Project>
      - How does it change if someone has a existing project and wants
        to "Donate" it to OWASP Foundation?
  - Items from Paulo's list here:
    <http://docs.google.com/View?docid=dcn8962c_24g648x5d3>
      - Is the New “streamlined” table approved? Are there any
        recommendations?
      - Dave has asked for a google sheet to deal with the assessment
        criteria. I suppose the goal is to make the assessment process
        easier. Should it be linked with the new “streamlined” table?
        How?

      - Can the reviewers role definition be improved? Shouldn't it be
        linked to the assessment criteria? How?

  -   - We need to set up as as possible a new season of code. How will
        it be done?
      - New projects waiting for Committee's response:

            Against Malware' project - Giorgio Fedon, See Appendant (2).

  - Boaz Gelbord's
    <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Security_Spending_Benchmarks>
    - Paulo's involvement and will be used by the Global Industry
    Committee to collect stats.

      - Can a set of criterion be established to define OWASP priorities
        in terms of projects available to be sponsored by our OWASP
        Members?

  - Discuss new project creation process: Paulos has directed many new
    project e-mails for our list and I think we should prioritize our
    tasks in order to make those projects start correctly. In this
    sense, integration activities should be prioritized.

      - Projects moving to release quality:
          - Anti-Sammy for Java
      - Identfify the list of projects that shall be sponsored by for
        2009 - should we consider having one season of quality/cleaning
        and one season of code?

<!-- end list -->

  -   - discuss a proper operational/coordination workflow

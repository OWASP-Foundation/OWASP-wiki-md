## Owasp.org Email Accounts

Owasp.org email accounts are provided for paid OWASP members, Chapter
Leaders, and Project Leaders. If you do not have one and fall into one
of these categories, submit your request through the contact us form.

It is recommended that chapter leaders use their owasp.org email account
for all OWASP related matters. There are a number of reasons for this
including: a separation between your contributions for OWASP and other
volunteer or paid work you may do, eliminating the appearance of
conflict of interest (by using a work email address for OWASP matters),
and protecting your personal privacy. The email address of chapter
leaders is listed both on the chapter wiki page (a means of contact) as
well as the administrator of the chapter mailing list. Using an
owasp.org email address prevents your personal email address from being
listed on a public site.

Your OWASP email account is also linked to your Google Drive account.
 You can use it to access or build community documents as needed.

## OWASP Wiki

Maintaining the website is the most basic aspect of promoting an OWASP
chapter. This is the place where people will be directed when looking at
our list of [meeting locations by geographic

Part of holding free and open chapter meetings is making the information
about your meetings (time and place) freely available and accessible.
Therefore it is imperative that  the information is posted on your wiki
page as soon as the meeting is set.  People must not be required to pay
or sign up for a service to learn about your meetings. 

The local chapter wiki page must include at least:

  - Information about the chapter leadership, including best way to
    contact.
  - Link to the chapter’s mailing list.
  - Information about future and historical events.
  - The presentations given in past meetings.

Other promotional services such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Ning,
Meetup, etc. are useful to inform people about your local chapter and
its activities; however, the OWASP Chapter Wiki Page must be the
authoritative information source at all times. Some services will have
an official alternative.  One example of this is MeetUp Pro which will
has an api that will allow you to mirror the meeting information you
post on your MeetUp Pro account to your wiki page and the OWASP Events
Calendar (Coming 2017).

If you have not already created a user account on our wiki site to edit
your chapter's wiki page, [please do
so](Special:RequestAccount "wikilink").

## Local Domain Names

Many leaders wish to purchase a local domain name for their OWASP
chapter, and this domain should point to the chapter web page on the
wiki and vice versa. It is important to note that the OWASP wiki is the
only website that ensures OWASP values and principles.

A few countries (such as China) have not been able to access the wiki
and therefore the local domain name is used as the main source of
information about OWASP for the country. If an exception is permitted,
every effort must be made to announce changes to leadership and upcoming
meetings on the chapter wiki page so that the global site information is
up to date.  If all else fails, you can do this by submitting a case
through the [Contact Us](http://sl.owasp.org/contactus) form.

Chapter leaders are free to register local domain names and submit the
expense for reimbursement from their chapter’s account.  To maintain
brand cohesion all domain names must be “OWASP \[Chapter location\]”
  If additional paperwork or authorization is needed for the
registration, submit your request to through the [Contact Us
form](http://sl.owasp.org/contactus). You must notify the Foundation
through this same form if you have registered the name to help us keep
track of what domain names have been purchased by OWASP.

## Mailing Lists

The chapter mailing list should be used to inform list members about
local OWASP activities. In addition to chapter meetings, which should
all be posted to the list, many chapters use their list as a way to
communicate information about upcoming security events, projects the
chapter is working on, or AppSec-related issues

Chapter leaders will be given the administrative password for their
chapter mailing list and will be responsible for moderation of the list.
If additional moderators need to be added to your list, please feel free
to add them as needed. Should a post need to be moderated, you will
receive an email from your list requesting approval.

When a person is listed as an administrator of a mailing list they will
receive all email sent to the OWASP leader's list. Please add all
(additional) chapter leaders to the administrative area on the mailing
list so that they will receive timely communication from the community.

Some other suggestions:

  - It is frowned upon by the OWASP Community to “spam” OWASP mailing
    lists regarding conferences in other regions. For example, it would
    be inappropriate for someone hosting a non-OWASP conference in India
    to send emails to multiple mailing lists outside of India.

<!-- end list -->

  - The best way to prevent “spam” from your chapter’s mailing list is
    to enable list moderation. This can be done by logging into the
    mailing list administrative interface and clicking on “Privacy
    Options” and “Sender filter.” There are options for moderating posts
    by both mailing list subscribers and nonsubscribers.

<!-- end list -->

  - The subject of posting job leads to a chapter’s mailing list is
    handled differently by each chapter. Some chapters encourage it as
    long as the jobs are local and security related, others frown upon
    it, instead encouraging the people hiring to stand up and promote
    their openings in person at the chapter meetings.
      - For discussion details: see “[\[Owasp-leaders\] Job Leads on
        Chapter Mailing
        Lists?](https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-leaders/2011-September/006072.html)”
      - OWASP has a [Jobs
        Board](https://www.linkedin.com/groups?jobs=&gid=36874&trk=groups_most_recent-h-jobs&_mSplash=1%7CJob)
        on LinkedIn. OWASP does not endorse commercial products or
        services and provides this listing for the benefit of the
        community. If you have additional questions or would like to
        post a job opening to this page visit our LinkedIn Jobs page.

## Social Media

Similar to the OWASP chapter mailing lists, social media under the
“OWASP” Chapter name should be used to inform subscribers about OWASP
activities as well as communicate information about upcoming security
events, projects the chapter is working on, or other appsec-related
issues. Social media used under the OWASP chapter name, must abide by
the [OWASP Principles and Code of Ethics](About_OWASP "wikilink").
Additionally, anyone who posts or moderates OWASP branded social media
must sign and abide by the Social Media Agreement.

While the chapter leader or member that sets up the account will hold
the password and be the official “owner” of the account,  this account
login information with other members of the leadership team and with the
Foundation. When new leadership takes over, the information must be
handed over to the new leader(s).

Note that, the chapter page on the OWASP wiki is the official
representation of the chapter. Therefore, communication on social media
platforms complement rather than replace the wiki page. Chapter members
cannot be required to sign up for any social media account to get access
to meeting notices. Do keep any new event or activity announcements up
to date on the wiki page, per section 4.2. It is important that any
social media platform the chapter uses be openly accessible, regularly
maintained and updated with accurate information.  Should the chapter
choose to leave a platform, it should close the social media account and
alert the Foundation using the [Contact
Us](http://sl.owasp.org/contactus) form.

Ideas for social media platforms used by current OWASP chapters (it is
not necessary for each chapter to have an account with each of these
platforms -- choose the forum that will be best for your geographic area
and audience):

  - [Delicious](http://delicious.com/)
  - [Digg](http://digg.com/)
  - [Eventbrite](http://www.eventbrite.com/)
  - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/owaspfoundation/)
  - [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/)
  - [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/)
  - [MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/pro/OWASP/)
  - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/owasp?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)

If the chapter opens an account on a service that the Foundation also
uses, is advisable that the chapter follow the Foundation account.  

## Organizing Your Contacts

It is recommended that each chapter have a central database (you have
access to the tools to maintain this in your force portal) in which to
organize their contacts and other important information. This can be a
comprehensive list of mailing list subscribers, LinkedIn group members,
local affiliations (and point of contact within the organization), and
sponsors (past, current, future). This will not only help when it is
time to pass chapter management onto a new person, but also with direct
mailings (which often generate more results than “list” mailings) and
finding future venues, sponsors, or even speakers. See also t
“Recruiting List Members.”

When using the contact database, remember to abide by our privacy rule.
Member contact lists may not be distributed outside of chapter
leadership.

## Handling Money

Chapter funds should be used for your chapter and must be spent in line
with the OWASP Foundation [purpose](About_OWASP "wikilink"),
[goals](OWASP_Strategic_Goals "wikilink"),
[principles](About_OWASP "wikilink"), and [code of
ethics](About_OWASP "wikilink"). Accordingly, chapter finances should be
handled in a transparent manner as described in [Chapter
2](Chapter_Handbook/Chapter_2:_Mandatory_Chapter_Rules "wikilink")

A chapter should have a treasurer who is in charge of money. This person
can be (and often is) the leader. His/her name should be communicated to
the Community Manager so we can update our official records. Some key
guidelines about managing your chapter budget:

  - Any Chapter which has a $0 or low bank account can ask for a grant.
     The funding request must include specifically what you wish to
    spend the money on.  Any amount in your chapter account will first
    be subtracted from the request.  For example, if you ask for $100 to
    pay for refreshments but have $40 in your account, we may give you a
    grant of $60. Needing a grant does not guarantee the OWASP
    Foundation will provide a grant. Pre-approval is required to ensure
    an expense is covered, especially if there's a chance of it
    exceeding a chapters's total funds.
  - Any Chapter with more than $5000 at the end of the year must submit
    a budget for the use of these monies or risk the surplus being put
    in the general outreach fund
  - Some ways of using funds require prior approval (see below).
  - All discussions about using funds, requests for funds, and budgets
    must be linked to transparently on the chapter wiki or in the
    chapter list archives.
  - Chapters have the right to ask for large budget items from the board
    during the annual budget creation (Prior to November first) (see
    below).

### Spending Guidelines

For the following common expenses, if the expenditure is under $500,
Chapter Leaders can consider their purchase “white-listed” for
reimbursement out of the chapter’s account, provided that the chapter
has the necessary funds in its account:

  -   - Meeting venue rental
      - Refreshments for a meeting
      - Promotion of a meeting
      - OWASP Merchandise

If, however, the expense does not fall under one of the above categories
or is greater than $500, a second signer (another chapter leader or
board member) must sign off on the purchase. While travel for speakers
is a common expense and may fall under $500, some chapters still prefer
to have a second signer to avoid the appearance of conflict of interest.
. Similarly, a donation of money out of the chapter’s account back to
the Foundation, requires a second signer. The exact details of the
reimbursement process can be found under [Reimbursement Process
Details](Reimbursement_Process_Details "wikilink")

From an administrative perspective, OWASP has a responsibility to show
its supporters that their donations (via members, sponsorship or other)
are being used properly - in support of the OWASP mission. Visit the
[OWASP Funding page](Funding "wikilink") under "Additional Resources" to
see your chapter's current funding balance.

Exceptions to the guidelines can be brought to the Staff for potential
approval and tracking.

### Additional Expense Policies

A chapter is free to adopt any additional procedure for authorizing
expenses as long as it is also authorized by the treasurer (or leader)
and documented on the wiki with all other chapter specific policies. The
treasurer (or leader) must, in addition to any bookkeeping required by
local authorities, keep a list of expenses made. This list should be
made public on the wiki with the budget.

### Reimbursement Process

The recommended process for paying for chapter-related expenses is to
pay for the expense out of pocket and submit the receipt through the
[OWASP reimbursement request
form](https://owasporg.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals) to
get your money back. This is a standardized reimbursement procedure for
OWASP. When your request is submitted, an authorization request will be
send to the appropriate chapter leaders for approval. You will not
receive your reimbursement until the approval has been received.

In case of doubt if an expense is in line with the OWASP principles, get
advice from the [Community
Manager](About_The_Open_Web_Application_Security_Project "wikilink").

### Chapter Budgets

[Sample Budget
Template](http://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fa%2Fowasp.org%2Fspreadsheet%2Fccc%3Fkey%3D0ApZ9zE0hx0LNdDQxakhaM1VWVG83N1ZwMGZCRGhYR3c%26hl%3Den_US%23gid%3D0)

Chapters do not hold their own money, it is held in trust for them by
the OWASP Foundation. However Chapters can track their balances using
the Chapter funding totals provided on the [OWASP Funding
page](Funding "wikilink") and write a budget for use of funds where
desired.  However all chapters with more than $5,000 in their account by
October 1st must submit a budget prior to November 1 for inclusion in
the Foundation budget for the following calendar year. The budget should
identify how they plan to spend the money in their account over the
course of the next year. A future projection budget can be included as
well for forecasted spending within the next 2 years. Unbudgeted funds
may be diverted to other chapters, or Community Engagement Funding
accounts if the chapter cannot be contacted or a budget is not received
prior to January 1.

Separate from the aforementioned budgeting process for chapter and
project accounts, any OWASP Leader can create a budget and provide it to
the OWASP Board prior to November 1 for inclusion in the Foundation
budget planning process. The budget will be reviewed by the Executive
Director and Board and, if approved, incorporated into the overall OWASP
Foundation budget for the following year. This would effectively set
aside the funds to use at the appropriate period of time, in the future,
with no further approvals necessary. Money that is budgeted in this
manner, that wasn’t spent during the calendar year, would be returned
back to the OWASP Foundation general funds.

### Money not Tracked by the Foundation

Chapter leaders cannot accept finances/funds through their own bank
accounts. OWASP Foundation (US) and OWASP Inc. (Europe) have been
created for the purpose of handling funds. Other countries have hired
third party companies to handle their finances. If OWASP funds will be
handled by a third party, notify the OWASP Foundation in advance to make
sure any necessary paperwork is completed.

If a sponsor pays a vendor directly (for signage, food, venue, etc.),
then this is a transaction that the Foundation does not need to track.
However, if the sponsor needs a receipt or record of the transaction
(for tax or other purposes), the money WILL need to go through the
Foundation.

To avoid appearance of impropriety, direct all potential donors to the
Donate button on your chapter wiki page or to an approved third party
processor.

## Charging for Events

It is against OWASP’s core values and principles to charge people to
attend chapter meetings. However, a chapter may decide to charge for a
training, or local conference. If your chapter is charging a fee for
training, event, or conference, the registration must go through the
Foundation’s account on your chosen registration platform.  Learn more
by using the [Contact Us form](http://sl.owasp.org/contactus).

Any event that charges an admission fee or requires more than $1000
foundation funds must be submitted to the [OCMS
System](https://ocms.owasp.org/) and approved by the [Executive
Director](About_The_Open_Web_Application_Security_Project "wikilink").
 To host an event, please read the [How to Host a
Conference](How_to_Host_a_Conference "wikilink") page.

## Insurance

The OWASP Foundation carries insurance coverage that is sufficient for
most meetings. If you need a certificate of insurance or have additional
questions about insurance, please submit your request through the
[Contact Us](http://sl.owasp.org/contactus) form.

## (Signing) Contracts

Chapter leaders are not authorized to sign contracts or enter into any
legal agreements on behalf of the OWASP Foundation. If a signed contract
is needed to guarantee your meeting venue or another service you would
like for your chapter, please [contact
us](http://sl.owasp.org/contactus) for approval.

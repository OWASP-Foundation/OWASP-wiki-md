This category is for tagging common types of application automated
threats.

## What is an automated threat?

Threat events (an instance of something causing harm) to applications
undertaken using automated actions. The focus is on abuse of
functionality - misuse of inherent functionality and related design
flaws, some of which are also referred to as business logic flaws. There
is almost no focus on implementation bugs.

In the specific case of web applications, threat events to web
applications undertaken using automated actions. And for this web
application case, attacks that can be achieved without the web are not
in scope.

## What web application automated threats exist?

The OWASP Automated Threat Handbook - Wed Applications
([pdf](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Automated-threat-handbook.pdf),
print), is the definitive guide to threats, detection and
countermeasures in this area. It is an output of the [OWASP Automated
Threats to Web Applications
Project](OWASP_Automated_Threats_to_Web_Applications "wikilink").

## How can I differentiate between automated threats to web applications?

The handbook provides defining characteristics, properties and a
description, as well as alternative names and threats each can be
confused with. The project has also created a [threat identification
chart](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/File:Oat-ontology-decision-chart.pdf)
to help correctly identify the automated threat.

## WebAppSec for Managers and Executives - The Road Less Travelled

**Instructor**

[Mano Paul](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/User:Manopaul)

**Duration**

1 day

**Summary**

With the financial turn tables of major corporations resting on web
applications that connect businesses, transmit and store sensitive
financial and personal transaction, combined with the ubiquitous nature
of the web; it is imperative that web applications that are designed,
architected and developed are secure.

What do you think Shakespeare had to say about Software Security? What
does an naked motorist have to do with Confidentiality? What does the
Jungle Book character Baloo have to say about Security Essentials (The
Bear Bare Necessities of Life security)? What does the African Wildlife
have to do with Security Concepts? What does pH have to do with
Security? and more … The Road Less Travelled by renowned poet, Robert
Frost ends by with the statement "And that has made all the difference".
Come to find out the answers to the questions above and see what it
takes to look at Security from a different perspective that would make
ALL the difference for you and your company.

**Audience**

## The Art and Science of Threat Modeling Web Applications

**Instructor**

[Mano Paul](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/User:Manopaul)

**Duration**

1 day

**Summary**

To secure your home, you will first need to know how the thief could
possibly enter and exit and where you should store your valuables. The
same is true of your web applications. Unless you know what the
vulnerabilities and threats of your web applications are, and what
security measures you should take to protect them, ev1L h@x0rS or the
enemy within (insider) could take advantage of the vulnerabilities.

Threat Modeling is a technique that you can use to identify ATVS
(attacks, threats, vulnerabilities and safeguards) that could affect
your web applications. Threat Modeling helps in designing your
application securely from a confidentiality, integrity, availability,
authentication, authorization and auditing perspective. It is an
essential activity to be undertaken during the design stage of your SDLC
and helps mitigate and minimize overall risk.

**Audience**

This session is for Management, Technical (Developer, QA, Security ...)
and Operational professionals and any stakeholder that needs to
understand how threat modeling can benefit their organizations/companies
in designing secure web applications. Whether you are a novice or an
expert apropos threat modeling, you will all leave learning something
new to design the next generation of hack-resilient web applications.

## Web server/services hardening using SELinux

**Instructor**

Pavol Luptak

**Duration**

1 day

**Summary**

Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a FLASK implementation integrated
in the Linux kernel with a number of utilities designed to provide
mandatory access controls (MAC) through the use of Linux Security
Modules (LSM) in the Linux kernel. SELinux generally supports many kinds
of mandatory access control policies, including those based on the
concepts of type enforcement, role-based access control, and multi-level
security.

A Linux kernel integrating SELinux enforces mandatory access control
policies that confine user programs and system servers to the minimum
amount of privilege they require to do their jobs. This reduces or
eliminates the ability of these programs and daemons to cause harm when
compromised (via buffer overflows or misconfigurations, for example).
This confinement mechanism operates independently of the traditional
Linux access control mechanisms. It has no concept of a "root"
super-user, and does not share the well-known shortcomings of the
traditional Linux security mechanisms (such as a dependence on
setuid/setgid binaries).

This training provides basic concepts of SELinux, its differences to
classical UNIX/Linux systems, describe security advantages of mandatory
access control policies and teach how to effectively and rapidly
configure a fully functional LAMP environment on SELinux system.

**Audience**

Security consultants, system administators, programmers focused on
system security

## Secure Programming with Java

**Instructor**

Lucas C. Ferreira

**Duration**

1 Day

**Summary**

This training class will present best practices of secure programming in
the Java language. It includes Java specific practices (i.e. how to
avoid problems that arise from the compilation of Java source code to
the bytecode language used by the JVM) and practices that may arise in
other programming languages (with examples in Java). Some tools that may
be used to verify the security of Java code and systems will be shown.

The topics include a quick overview of the OWASP Top 10, in order to
contextualize the practices presented, and several best practices aimed
at the different software layers. At the presentation layer, we focus on
input validation, access control issues and dealing with exceptions. At
the business objects layer, the practices deal with cloning and
serialization issues. Practices to prevent command injection are
presented at the persistence layer. Practices that should be used
throughout all the software are also presented, including input data
validation, class and method visibility, using and storing secrets,
dealing with inner classes, overflows and boxing, and object
initialization.

**Audience**

Java web application developers. This training requires basic
understanding of web applications and an intermediate level of
proficiency in the Java language and Object Oriented concepts. People
with interest in other OO languages may also benefit from this training,
but specific techniques, examples and tools used are targeted to Java.

## OWASP Top 10 - What Developers Should Know on Web Application Security

**Instructor**

Sebastien Deleersnyder and Martin Knobloch

**Duration**

4 h To be scheduled on Tuesday.

**Summary**

Application security is an essential component of any successful
project; this includes web applications, open source PHP applications,
web services and proprietary business web sites. Web application
security education and awareness is needed throughout the entire
development and deployment organization. Each area and level of
development or deployment organizations have specific needs and
requirements regarding web application security education. A manager
needs other information than a security professional or developer.
Novices to the profession require other training than people with
several years of experience.

The OWASP Education project aims to provide in building blocks of web
application security information. These modules can be combined together
in education tracks targeting different audiences. This Education Track
provides in a 4 hour session covering what developers should know on web
application security. It starts with an explanation of web application
security and why it is important. Then the OWASP Top 10 is used to
explain the nastiest vulnerabilities and how these can be prevented or
re mediated. A secure coding initiative must deal with all stages of a
program’s life cycle. Secure web applications are only possible when a
secure SDLC is used. The SDLC is explained from the standpoint of
people, processes and tools. Particularly for developers good secure
development practices are covered in a separate topic. Finally the track
finishes with an exhaustive list of web application security resources
for web application developers.

**Audience**

Web application developers who are unaware there are security issues
with contemporary web applications. No prior knowledge of web
application security is assumed nor necessary. This track is independent
of the coding language or web frameworks used; like PHP, JSF, Java EE or
.NET. We must realize that web application developers are only one link
- albeit an important one - of the chain that represents the security of
a web application. This track aims to make that link as secure as
possible, given the constraint of 4 hours. Another important aspect is
that web application security should be tailored to the risk profile of
an organization and the specific development environment of that
organization.

**Table of Contents**

The challenge is to cover web application security in 4 hours to a web
application developer. This is presented in such a way that the
developers will be able to recognize and correct web application
vulnerabilities in their projects.

**Table of Contents**

If you're attending the OWASP Summit, then you understand that web
application security is a big issue. Empirical and anecdotal evidence
clearly suggests web applications are being attacked, and with high
degrees of success. But its one thing to know about web application
hacking, and its quite another to know how to hack them yourself. This
workshop by SensePost is about hacking web applications. Not the
theories, the lists and the tools, but the techniques and an out-of-box
thought process that underpin genuinely unique and original web
application compromises. The workshop employees a series of carefully
designed web hacking exercises as its integral learning tool.

Each exercise is designed to teach a specific lesson and will be
discussed in detail after it is completed. In this way you learn from
your instructors, your colleagues and your own successes and failures.
The exercises have all been designed to replicate real-life scenarios
with real-life-hacker stumbling blocks along the way.

### About the OWASP Connections Committee (OCC)

The OWASP Connections Committee was created during the OWASP AppSec DC
2009 conference. Our mission is to help the OWASP foundation communicate
to the outside world in a unified and coherent way. We also assist with
internal communication between different OWASP projects and committees.

**Application Security Tools**

This category is for articles describing application security tools. The
tools can be divided into a few basic categories:

  - [:Category:OWASP Tool](:Category:OWASP_Tool "wikilink")
  - [:Category:Commercial Tool](:Category:Commercial_Tool "wikilink")
  - [:Category:Non-OWASP Open
    Tool](:Category:Non-OWASP_Open_Tool "wikilink")

## Important note about commercial tools

OWASP encourages constructive discussion of commercial application
security tools. We support the use of tools as a **part** of an
application security program. However, we object to the marketing of
these tools as a solution to application security. Vendors that claim
that their tools address the OWASP Top Ten (and there are many) should
be aware that this is well beyond the state of the art. In addition, the
use of the OWASP brand in this manner is a violation of the [OWASP brand
usage rules](OWASP_brand_usage_rules "wikilink").

## How to add a tool

First create a [stub](:Category:Stub "wikilink") for the tool you want
to add. Your article should include details about:

  - the type of tool
  - basic features of the tool
  - key distinguishers of the tool
  - where the tool can be found
  - constructive information about strengths and weaknesses of the tool

This year the Portland OWASP chapter is hosting a training day. This
will be an excellent opportunity for students to receive quality
information security and application security training for next to
nothing. It will also be a great chance to network with the local
infosec community.

# Courses

Courses are held in two tracks: two in the morning session, and two in
the afternoon session. Each student can register for one morning course,
or one afternoon course, or one of each. The four courses offered are as
follows:

## Morning Session

### Cyber Hygiene - Critical Security Controls

*Instructor: Brian Ventura*
*Assistant: Anthony Gold*
With so many types of network attacks and so many tools/solutions to
combat these attacks, which should I implement first? Which should I
buy? Can I build it myself? The CIS Critical Security Controls are a
prioritized approach to ensuring information security. As a general risk
assessment, the Critical Security Controls address the past, current and
expected attacks occurring across the Internet. In this course we will
outline the controls, discuss implementation and testing, and provide
examples.

### Introduction to Injection Vulnerabilities

*Instructor: Timothy D. Morgan*
*Assistant: Bhushan Gupta*
*Sponsored by [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/)*

Ever concatenated strings in your code? Did those strings include any
kind of structured syntax? Then your code might be vulnerable to
injection. Injection flaws are broad, common category of vulnerability
in modern software. While many developers are aware of high-profile
technical issues, such as SQL injection, any number of injection
vulnerabilities are possible in other languages, protocols, and
syntaxes. Upon studying these flaws in many contexts, an underlying
"theory of injection" emerges. This simple concept can be applied to
many situations (including new technologies and those yet to be
invented) to help developers avoid the most common types of
implementation vulnerabilities. The reason why "injection" is \#1 on the
OWASP Top 10 will become very clear by the end of this class. This
course will provide students a detailed introduction to injection
vulnerabilities and then get students busy with hands-on exercises where
a variety of different injection flaws can be explored and understood in
real-world contexts.

## Afternoon Session

### Applied Physical Attacks on Embedded Systems, Introductory Version

*Instructor: Joe Fitzpatrick*
*Assistant: Scott Davis*
This workshop introduces several different relatively accessible
interfaces on embedded systems. Attendees will get hands-on experience
with UART, SPI, and JTAG interfaces on a MIPS-based wifi router. After a
brief architectural overview of each interface, hands-on labs will guide
through the process understanding, observing, interacting with, and
exploiting the interface to potentially access a root shell on the
target.

### Communications Security in Modern Software

*Instructor: Adam Russell*
*Assistant: Sonny*
*Sponsored by [OHSU School of
Medicine](https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/)*
Securing communications over untrusted networks is a critical component
to any modern application's security. However, far too often developers
and operations personnel become tripped up by the many pitfalls of
implementation in this area, which often leads to complete failures to
secure data on the wire. In this course we discuss how attackers can
gain access to other users' communication through a variety of
techniques and cover the strategies for preventing this. The course
covers specific topics ranging from the SSL/TLS certificate authority
system, to secure web session management and mobile communications
security. A hands-on exercise is included in the course which helps
students empirically test SSL/TLS certificate validation in a realistic
scenario.

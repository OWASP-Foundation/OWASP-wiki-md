\== The presentation ==

![Owasp_logo_normal.jpg](Owasp_logo_normal.jpg
"Owasp_logo_normal.jpg")The ESAPI Swingset is a web application which
demonstrates common security vulnerabilities and asks users to secure
the application against these vulnerabilities using the ESAPI library.
The application is intended for Java Developers. The goal of the
application is to teach developers about the functionality of the ESAPI
library and give users a practical understanding of how it can be used
to protect web applications against common security vulnerabilities.
During the talk, Fabio will demonstrate how to install and use ESAPI
Swingset in your organization.

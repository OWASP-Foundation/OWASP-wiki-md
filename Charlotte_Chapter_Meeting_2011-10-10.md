Our 2011-10-10 meeting featured [Jeff
Williams](User:Jeff_Williams "wikilink"), CEO of Aspect Security and
former Volunteer Chair for OWASP. Jeff did a rapid-fire discussion of
[lots of different
topics](Media:OWASP_Jeff_Williams_Talk.ppt "wikilink"). We also
discussed things we can do to make the chapter a success. Please be sure
to send [Jeff](User:Jeff_Williams "wikilink") your thanks.

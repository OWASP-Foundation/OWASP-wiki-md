## Request for Review

Now that the The OWASP Testing Guide v2.0 has reached the 'Release
Candidate 1 milestone, the time has come to make sure that everything is
100% and that there is nothing major missing.

During the next month we invite you all to review the current version of
the OWASP Testing Guide, which is available in WIKI format here:
[OWASP_Testing_Guide_v2_Table_of_Contents](OWASP_Testing_Guide_v2_Table_of_Contents "wikilink")

For your conveinience this version is also available in [Adobe PDF
format](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Image:OWASP_Testing_Guide_v2_RC1_pdf.zip)
or [Ms Doc
format](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Image:OWASP_Testing_Guide_v2_RC1_doc.zip)

The current plan is to create a 'published' version of this guide on the
10th of February which will be sent to all OWASP members in book format.

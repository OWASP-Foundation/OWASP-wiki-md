### How to track an OWASP Leader

Ideally we should be able to track OWASP leaders, the question is how?

What could we give the leaders that would easily identify them (in
practical and usable way):

  - a special wristband
      - with a particular color?
      - with a particular logo or message?
      - wth a GPC tag? (or auto-location-tweet)
  - an armband
  - a hat
  - a scarf
  - a t-shirt
  - a bag
  - with a paintball gun?

### AppSec Soccer Tournament

**When:** Friday after the conference
**Where:** TBC
**Participants:**

  - Dinis Cruz
  - Kate Hartmann (can also be a referre)



### To do (tasks)

  - for each each participant
      - link to MediaWiki user page
      - add twitter accounts
  - Travel arrangements
      - map travel dates
      - when/where they are arriving
      - where are they staying
  - figure out what to do with the leaders when they are there
  - should we create a welcome pack for these leaders?
  - should we see if they need help in their travel arrangements?
  - should we see if its possible to find a local host for the
    accomodation (it is always better than going into an hotel)?
  - do we need a budget? if so, how much?

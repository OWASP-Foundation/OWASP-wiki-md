<td><h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>The OWASP Java™ and JVM Technology Knowledge Base is the clearing house for all information related to building secure web/distributed applications and services based on Java and JVM technologies. The focus of these pages is on guidance for developers and architects using Java frameworks and JVM based technologies for web application development, on OWASP components that use Java and on participation in OWASP projects that use Java and JVM technologies. Moreover, we aim to provide security related guidance for system administrators managing Java and JVM based applications and tools.</p>
<p>The project is not limited to Java. It aims to also address topics around the JVM in general.</p>
<p>Community content is key to security information. The project depends on content from developers throughout the Java and JVM ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<ul>
<li>Provide deep, rich guidance for Java developers in using the security features of Java and of Java frameworks.</li>
<li>Address security in relation to the Java Virtual Machine and derived technologies.</li>
<li>Guide system administrators in managing Java and JVM related components and applications.</li>
<li>Create guidance for use of OWASP components that are designed for use with Java or other JVM languages.</li>
<li>Focus on information about working with and on OWASP tools built using Java or other JVM technologies.</li>
<li>Provide a stream of security related information, like vulnerabilities and security patches, related to the Java and JVM universe.</li>
<li>Build an ecosystem allowing to all actors interested to discuss, share and learn.</li>

# Related 3rd Party Projects

A list of third party (i.e. not part of Java SE or EE) security
frameworks. This page contains a list of Java security libraries and
frameworks and indicates which security features each library supports.

## Enterprise

  - [Apache Shiro](http://shiro.apache.org/) is a Java security
    framework that performs authentication, authorization, cryptography,
    and session management.
  - [Spring Security](http://projects.spring.io/spring-security/)
    provides security services for Java EE-based enterprise software
    applications. Services include authentication, authorization and
    protection against attacks like session fixation, clickjacking and
    cross site request forgery.
  - [HDIV](http://www.hdiv.org/) A web application security framework
    that provides a number of functions.

## Access Control (Authentication and Authorization)

  - [OACC](http://oaccframework.org/) is an application security
    framework for Java designed for fine grained (object level) access
    control. OACC uses the abstraction of a *resource* for the
    application objects being secured. This key abstraction enables OACC
    to provide a rich API that includes grant, revoke and query
    capabilities for storing and managing the application's security
    relationships.
  - [PicketLink](http://picketlink.org/appsecurity/) provides
    authentication, single sign on, permission based access control and
    other security features.

## Encryption

  - [Keyczar](https://github.com/google/keyczar) is an open source
    cryptographic toolkit designed to make it easier and safer for
    developers to use cryptography in their applications. Keyczar
    supports authentication and encryption with both symmetric and
    asymmetric keys.
  - [Bouncycastle](http://www.bouncycastle.org/) is a lightweight Java
    cryptography API <i>provider</i>.
  - [Jasypt](http://www.jasypt.org/) is a Java library which allows the
    developer to add basic encryption capabilities to his/her projects
    with minimum effort, and without the need of having deep knowledge
    on how cryptography works.

## XML Security

  - The [Apache Santuario](http://santuario.apache.org/) project is
    aimed at providing implementation of the primary security standards
    for XML: XML-Signature Syntax and Processing and XML Encryption
    Syntax and Processing.

## Validation

  - [Vlad](http://www.sapia-oss.org/projects/vlad/home.html) stands for
    "validation". This projects indeed aims at offering a simple,
    high-level, extensible, generic validation framework that can easily
    be integrated into existing applications.
  - [This OWASP
    article](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Protect_FileUpload_Against_Malicious_File)
    and [code
    snippet](https://github.com/righettod/document-upload-protection)
    proposes a way to protect a file upload feature against submission
    of files that may contain malicious code.
  - [The Apache Common's
    validator](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-validator/) can
    be used to perform validation.

# Tasks and Roadmap

## Roadmap

  - Build Java and JVM security related net resources guide
  - The OWASP Java and JVM Technology Knowledge Base is principally
    about creating deep, rich guidance for Java and JVM developers using
    all kind of security resources. The idea is to have an effort of
    building a internet resource guide for everything around the JVM
    universe. Information, blogs, articles, tools, test servers and
    more. Important however is that this list is seriously curated.
  - Concrete guideline for Java and JVM developers
  - Clear checklists, around various topics, language, servers and
    frameworks.



# Get involved

The first step would be to establish contact with the project leaders
and/or the entire team. This can be done using a direct and private
message, or by joining the public mailing list to say hello.

When it comes to participating in project activities, everything depends
on the time you are willing and able to invest. It is however very
important to not jump into too many things at the beginning, later
having to back out or to let unfinished things behind you. It is much
better to start with small tasks, increasing intensity and investment
over time.

Please also be patient with expecting the "merge" of your work into the
existing project pages and code. As everywhere in live, trust has to be
built-up.

The Java and JVM knowledge base has currently multiple tasks open, which
can be found on the adequate section of this page. Not all tasks require
a wiki account. Please take something you are interested in and start
participating. Work load is not the only outcome when participating in
open projects. You are getting a lot of things back: recognition,
satisfaction, knowledge and contacts, sometime friends.

Sounds cool? Then jump in...

JVM Mailing List](http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/java-project)

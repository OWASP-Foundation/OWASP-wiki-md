## Summary

There is nothing new under the sun, and nearly every web application
that one may think of developing has already been developed. With the
vast number of free and open source software projects that are actively
developed and deployed around the world, it is very likely that an
application security test will face a target site that is entirely or
partly dependent on these well known applications (e.g. Wordpress,
phpBB, Mediawiki, etc). Knowing the web application components that are
being tested significantly helps in the testing process and will also
drastically reduce the effort required during the test. These well known
web applications have known HTML headers, cookies, and directory
structures that can be enumerated to identify the application.

## Test Objectives

Identify the web application and version to determine known
vulnerabilities and the appropriate exploits to use during testing.

## How to Test

### Cookies

A relatively reliable way to identify a web application is by the
application-specific cookies.

Consider the following HTTP-request:

    GET / HTTP/1.1
    User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.2; WOW64; rv:31.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/31.0
    Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
    Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
    '''Cookie: wp-settings-time-1=1406093286; wp-settings-time-2=1405988284'''
    DNT: 1
    Connection: keep-alive
    Host: blog.owasp.org

The cookie *CAKEPHP* has automatically been set, which gives information
about the framework being used. List of common cookies names is
presented in Cpmmon Application Identifiers section. However, it is
possible to change the name of the cookie.

### HTML source code

This technique is based on finding certain patterns in the HTML page
source code. Often one can find a lot of information which helps a
tester to recognize a specific web application. One of the common
markers are HTML comments that directly lead to application disclosure.
More often certain application-specific paths can be found, i.e. links
to application-specific css and/or js folders. Finally, specific script
variables might also point to a certain application.

From the meta tag below, one can easily learn the application used by a
website and its version. The comment, specific paths and script
variables can all help an attacker to quickly determine an instance of
an application.

    <meta name="generator" content="WordPress 3.9.2" />

More frequently such information is placed between

<head>

</head>

tags, in

<meta>

tags or at the end of the page. Nevertheless, it is recommended to check
the whole document since it can be useful for other purposes such as
inspection of other useful comments and hidden fields.

### Specific files and folders

Apart from information gathered from HTML sources, there is another
approach which greatly helps an attacker to determine the application
with high accuracy. Every application has its own specific file and
folder structure on the server. It has been pointed out that one can see
the specific path from the HTML page source but sometimes they are not
explicitly presented there and still reside on the server.

In order to uncover them a technique known as dirbusting is used.
Dirbusting is brute forcing a target with predictable folder and file
names and monitoring HTTP-responses to emumerate server contents. This
information can be used both for finding default files and attacking
them, and for fingerprinting the web application. Dirbusting can be done
in several ways, the example below shows a successful dirbusting attack
against a WordPress-powered target with the help of defined list and
intruder functionality of Burp Suite.

![Image:Wordpress_dirbusting.png](Wordpress_dirbusting.png
"Image:Wordpress_dirbusting.png")

We can see that for some WordPress-specific folders (for instance,
/wp-includes/, /wp-admin/ and /wp-content/) HTTP-reponses are 403
(Forbidden), 302 (Found, redirection toÂ wp-login.php) and 200 (OK)
respectively. This is a good indicator that the target is
WordPress-powered. The same way it is possible to dirbust different
application plugin folders and their versions. On the screenshot below
one can see a typical CHANGELOG file of a Drupal plugin, which provides
information on the application being used and discloses a vulnerable
plugin version.

![Image:Drupal_botcha_disclosure.png](Drupal_botcha_disclosure.png
"Image:Drupal_botcha_disclosure.png")

Tip: before starting dirbusting, it is recommended to check the
robots.txt file first. Sometimes application specific folders and other
sensitive information can be found there as well. An example of such a
robots.txt file is presented on a screenshot below.

![Image:Robots-info-disclosure.png](Robots-info-disclosure.png
"Image:Robots-info-disclosure.png")

Specific files and folders are different for each specific application.
It is recommended to install the corresponding application during
penetration tests in order to have better understanding of what
infrastructure is presented and what files might be left on the server.
However, several good file lists already exist and one good example is
FuzzDB wordlists of predictable files/folders
(http://code.google.com/p/fuzzdb/).

## Tools

A list of general and well-known tools is presented below. There are
also a lot of other utilities, as well as framework-based fingerprinting
tools.

### WhatWeb

Website: <http://www.morningstarsecurity.com/research/whatweb>
Currently one of the best fingerprinting tools on the market. Included
in a default [Kali Linux](Kali_Linux "wikilink") build. Language: Ruby
Matches for fingerprinting are made with:

  - Text strings (case sensitive)
  - Regular expressions
  - Google Hack Database queries (limited set of keywords)
  - MD5 hashes
  - URL recognition
  - HTML tag patterns
  - Custom ruby code for passive and aggressive operations

Sample output is presented on a screenshot below:

### BlindElephant

Website: <https://community.qualys.com/community/blindelephant>
This great tool works on the principle of static file checksum based
version difference thus providing a very high quality of fingerprinting.
Language: Python

Sample output of a successful fingerprint:

    pentester$ python BlindElephant.py http://my_target drupal
    Loaded /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/blindelephant/dbs/drupal.pkl with 145 versions, 478 differentiating paths, and 434 version groups.
    Starting BlindElephant fingerprint for version of drupal at http://my_target

    Hit http://my_target/CHANGELOG.txt
    File produced no match. Error: Retrieved file doesn't match known fingerprint. 527b085a3717bd691d47713dff74acf4

    Hit http://my_target/INSTALL.txt
    File produced no match. Error: Retrieved file doesn't match known fingerprint. 14dfc133e4101be6f0ef5c64566da4a4

    Hit http://my_target/misc/drupal.js
    Possible versions based on result: 7.12, 7.13, 7.14

    Hit http://my_target/MAINTAINERS.txt
    File produced no match. Error: Retrieved file doesn't match known fingerprint. 36b740941a19912f3fdbfcca7caa08ca

    Hit http://my_target/themes/garland/style.css
    Possible versions based on result: 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 7.7, 7.8, 7.9, 7.10, 7.11, 7.12, 7.13, 7.14

    ...

    Fingerprinting resulted in:
    7.14


    Best Guess: 7.14

### Wappalyzer

Website: <http://wappalyzer.com>
Wapplyzer is a Firefox Chrome plug-in. It works only on regular
expression matching and doesn't need anything other than the page to be
loaded on browser. It works completely at the browser level and gives
results in the form of icons. Although sometimes it has false positives,
this is very handy to have notion of what technologies were used to
construct a target website immediately after browsing a page.

Sample output of a plug-in is presented on a screenshot below.

## Remediation

The general advice is to use several of the tools described above and
check logs to better understand what exactly helps an attacker to
disclose the web framework. By performing multiple scans after changes
have been made to hide framework tracks, it's possible to achieve a
better level of security and to make sure of the framework can not be
detected by automatic scans. Below are some specific recommendations by
framework marker location and some additional interesting approaches.

#### HTTP headers

Check the configuration and disable or obfuscate all HTTP-headers that
disclose information the technologies used. Here is an interesting
article about HTTP-headers obfuscation using Netscaler:
<http://grahamhosking.blogspot.ru/2013/07/obfuscating-http-header-using-netscaler.html>

#### Cookies

It is recommended to change cookie names by making changes in the
corresponding configuration files.

#### HTML source code

Manually check the contents of the HTML code and remove everything that
explicitly points to the framework.

General guidelines:

  - Make sure there are no visual markers disclosing the framework
  - Remove any unnecessary comments (copyrights, bug information,
    specific framework comments)
  - Remove META and generator tags
  - Use the companies own css or js files and do not store those in a
    framework-specific folders
  - Do not use default scripts on the page or obfuscate them if they
    must be used.

#### Specific files and folders

General guidelines:

  - Remove any unnecessary or unused files on the server. This implies
    text files disclosing information about versions and installation
    too.
  - Restrict access to other files in order to achieve 404-response when
    accessing them from outside. This can be done, for example, by
    modifying htaccess file and adding RewriteCond or RewriteRule there.
    An example of such restriction for two common WordPress folders is
    presented below.

<!-- end list -->

    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} /wp-login\.php$ [OR]
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} /wp-admin/$
    RewriteRule $ /http://your_website [R=404,L]

However, these are not the only ways to restrict access. In order to
automate this process, certain framework-specific plugins exist. One
example for WordPress is StealthLogin
(http://wordpress.org/plugins/stealth-login-page).

#### Additional approaches

General guidelines:

  - Checksum management
      -
        The purpose of this approach is to beat checksum-based scanners
        and not let them disclose files by their hashes. Generally,
        there are two approaches in checksum management:
          - Change the location of where those files are placed (i.e.
            move them to another folder, or rename the existing folder)
          - Modify the contents - even slight modification results in a
            completely different hash sum, so adding a single byte in
            the end of the file should not be a big problem.
  - Controlled chaos
      -
        A funny and effective method that involves adding bogus files
        and folders from other frameworks in order to fool scanners and
        confuse an attacker. But be careful not to overwrite existing
        files and folders and to break the current framework\!

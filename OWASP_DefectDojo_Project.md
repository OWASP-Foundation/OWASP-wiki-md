<p>An open source vulnerability management tool that streamlines the testing process by offering templating, report generation, metrics, and baseline self-service tools.</p>
<p>DefectDojo is an Application Security Program tool written in Python / Django. DefectDojo was created in 2013 and open-sourced on March 13th, 2015. The project was started to make optimizing vulnerability tracking less painful. The top goal of DefectDojo is to reduce the amount of time security professionals spend logging vulnerabilities. DefectDojo accomplishes this by offering a templating system for vulnerabilities, imports for common vulnerability scanners, report generation, and metrics.</p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>DefectDojo streamlines the testing process through several 'models' that an admin can manipulate with Python code. The core models include: 'engagements', 'tests' and 'findings'. DefectDojo has supplemental models that facilitate metrics, authentication, report generation, and tools. DefectDojo is written in Python and Django.</p>
<p>Testing or installing DefectDojo is easy. If you decide to setup an instance of Dojo for your organization, we have developed a script that handles all dependencies, configures the database, and creates a super user. Complete installation instructions are found <a href="https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo#installation">here</a>. A complete walk-through can be found <a href="http://defectdojo.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">here</a>. Documented example workflows can be found <a href="https://github.com/rackerlabs/django-DefectDojo/blob/master/doc/workflows.md">1</a>.</p>

# FAQs

## How can I participate in your project?

All you have to do is make the Project Leaders aware of your available
time to contribute to the project. It is also important to let the
Leaders know how you would like to contribute and pitch in to help the
project meet its goals and milestones. There are many different ways you
can contribute to an OWASP Project, but communication with the leads is
key. If you are a programmer and wish to contribute code, we regularly
review [pull
requests](https://github.com/rackerlabs/django-DefectDojo/pulls).

## If I am not a programmer can I participate in your project?

Yes, you can certainly participate in the project if you are not a
programmer or technical. The project needs different skills and
expertise and different times during its development. Currently, we are
looking for people to help translate our documentation. See the Road Map
and Getting Involved tab for more details.

# Acknowledgements

## Contributors

The project is extremely grateful for all of our contributors both prior
to becoming open source and after. [Contributors since going open
source](https://github.com/OWASP/django-DefectDojo/graphs/contributors).

# Road Map and Getting Involved

At this time, Dojo is already being used by multiple large enterprises.
Part of our next steps is to better evangelize our work and encourage
others to contribute. However, we do have a set of core contributors
that actively work on the project.

## Roadmap

**July 2018 Release 1.5:**

  -   - Updated UI with a new DefectDojo logo, default colors and CSS.
      - Updated Product views with tabs for Product Overview, Metrics,
        Engagements, Endpoints, Benchmarks (ASVS), and Settings to make
        it easier to navigate and manage your products.
      - New Product Information fields: Regulations, Criticality,
        Platform, Lifecycle, Origin, User Records, Revenue, External
        Audience, Internet Accessible
      - Languages pie chart on product overview, only supported through
        the API and Django admin, integrates with cloc analyzer
      - New Engagement type of CI/CD to support continual testing
      - Engagement shortcuts and ability to import findings and
        auto-create an engagement
      - Engagement labels for overdue, no tests and findings
      - New Contextual menus throughout DefectDojo and shortcuts to new
        findings and critical findings
      - Ability to merge a finding into a parent finding and either
        inactivate or delete the merged findings.
      - Report improvements and styling adjustment with the default
        option of HTML reports
      - SLA for remediation of severities based on finding criticality,
        for example critical findings remediated within 7 days.
        Configurable in System Settings.
      - Engagement Auto-Close Days in System Settings. Automatically
        close an engagement if open past the end date.
      - Ability to apply remediation advice based on CWE. For example
        XSS can be configured as a template so that itâ€™s consistent
        across all findings. Enabled in system settings.
      - Finding confidence field supported from scanners. First
        implementation in the Burp importer.
      - Goast importer for static analysis of Golang products
      - Celery status check on System Settings
      - Beta rules framework release for modifying findings on the fly
      - DefectDojo 2.0 API with Swagger support
      - Created and Modified fields on all major tables
      - Various bug fixes reported on Github

As of March, 2016, the highest priorities for the next 6 months are:
<strong>

  - A proof of concept plugin that will aid in retesting automation
  - JIRA Integration
  - Dynamic Application Tagging.

</strong>

Subsequent Releases will add:

<strong>

  - CI / CD for pull requests
  - Additional Unit Tests
  - Automated Regression tests

</strong>

## Getting Involved

Involvement in the development and promotion of
<strong>DefectDojo</strong> is actively encouraged\! You do not have to
be a security expert or a programmer to contribute. Some of the ways you
can help are as follows:

### Coding

We could implement some of the later items on the roadmap sooner if
someone wanted to help out with unit or automated regression tests

### Localization

Are you fluent in another language? Can you help translate the text
strings in the <strong>DefectDojo</strong> into that language?

### Testing

Do you have a flair for finding bugs in software? We want to produce a
high quality product, so any help with Quality Assurance would be
greatly appreciated. Let us know if you can offer any help.

### Feedback

Please use the [DefectDojo project mailing
list](https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/OWASP_Tool_Project_Template)
for feedback about:

  - What do like?
  - What don't you like?
  - What features would you like to see prioritized on the roadmap?

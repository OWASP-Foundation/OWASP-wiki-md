### Description

Lists of full credit and/or debit card data are tested against a
merchantâ€™s payment processes to identify valid card details. The quality
of stolen data is often unknown, and Carding is used to identify good
data of higher value. Payment cardholder data may have been stolen from
another application, stolen from a different payment channel, or
acquired from a criminal marketplace.

When partial cardholder data is available, and the expiry date and/or
security code are not known, the process is instead known as [OAT-010
Card Cracking](OAT-010_Card_Cracking "wikilink"). The use of stolen
cards to obtain cash or goods is [OAT-012 Cashing
Out](OAT-012_Cashing_Out "wikilink").

### Other Names and Examples

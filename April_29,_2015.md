  - Proposed change to Section 3.03 of the bylaws (Bil Corry)
      - Text: "PROPOSED SECTION 3.03 Regular Meetings. The Board of
        Directors shall have regular meetings as needed. A link to the
        board meeting agendaâ€™s and the historical minutes is here:
        <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Board_Meetings>. Meetings
        shall be at such dates, times, and places as the Board shall
        determine in December of the preceding year and as amended by
        the Board. In no event will there be less than one meeting per
        quarter. These meetings will be open to public attendance,
        however, certain portions of the meeting may be closed to board
        members and their delegates when required for legal reasons, or
        to shield liability, or to handle personnel issues, or similar.
        Attendance in person or virtually by board members is required
        at no less than 75% of the total meetings each year and shall be
        highly encouraged to meet in person at least once annually at a
        date to be announced and agreed upon. Attendance is tabulated
        after every scheduled meeting for the purpose of determining if
        the 75% attendance requirement has been met, and the tabulation
        is based upon the entire calendar year. Cancelled meetings are
        considered attended for the purposes of the tabulation. Failure
        by a board member to meet the 75% attendance requirement after
        any tabulation will cause a mandatory vote of confidence by the
        remaining board members, whose votes will be publicly recorded.
        An overall vote of "no confidence" is recorded if half or more
        of the board members vote for it, which causes the board member
        in question to be instantly removed from their seat on the
        board. Vacancies on the board are handled as per Section 3.10."
      - current bylaws:
        <https://www.owasp.org/images/9/92/April2014OWASPFoundationByLaws.pdf>
      - short discussion whether 75% or 66% or what would be good
        number?

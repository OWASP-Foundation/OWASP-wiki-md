### Implementation guides

## Objective

This document will describe different areas of secure implementation of
Enterprise Business Applications and ERP systems. Here, we will mainly
focus on security architecture and configuration threats because program
errors are well described in the "Software vulnerabilities" topic.

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to increase awareness of the
administrators of Business Application security and help them to start
self-assessment of their systems to find the most critical violations.

## Intro

Enterprise Business Applications (like ERP, it is any software system
that has been designed to support and automate the business process of
medium and large business) are very large systems that consist of
different components such as Database server, Front-end, Web server,
Application server and other parts. Also, those systems rely on
different hardware and software that can have their own vulnerabilities.
Every described layer may have its own vulnerabilities and
misconfigurations that can give an attacker full access to business
data, even if other layers are completely secured.

All of the data was collected and categorized during our extensive
experience of assessing the security of popular Business Applications
such as SAP ERP, Oracle E-Business Suite, Oracle Peoplesoft, JD-Edwards
and other less known or custom applications.

## Main

Overall security of Enterprise Business Application consists of
different layers, including:
• Network architecture security
• OS security
• Database security
• Application security
• Front-end security
In this document, we will describe top 10 violations for every layer of
Enterprise Business Applications that can be easily assessed and
mitigated.

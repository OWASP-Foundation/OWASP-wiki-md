## OWASP AppSec US 2009 Highlights

In this lecture we will review the highlights of the last OWASP AppSec
Conference in DC. We review some of the trends in application security,
and updates to OWASP Projects. Among other topics, we will discuss the
upcoming launch of the new OWASP Top 10 (2010), which is now in Release
Candidate state, and reflects the changes in the spread of various
application attacks.

## Decompilation Injection

'''Maty Siman, Checkmarx '''

The presentation will show a novel way to protect .NET assemblies
against reverse-engineering and recompilation. By injecting them with
commands that are activated only at the recompilation stage, the
application retroactively detects the reverse-engineering process and
acts upon it.

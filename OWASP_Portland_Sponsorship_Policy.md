    that you have made a contribution and would like to be registered as
    a chapter supporter.

Alternatively, you may choose to host a chapter meeting or similar
chapter event. In doing so, the chapter will consider this equivalent to
a $150 donation if you provide:

  - A venue for the event
  - Food and drinks for participants

# How Funds are Used

Chapter funds are used to host chapter meetings, trainings, networking,
and other community outreach events. In some cases, funds may be used to
compensate speakers and trainers for their travel costs.

Chapter organizers are volunteers and are never paid for their time. All
chapter funds are managed by the OWASP Foundation and are spent in
accordance with OWASP policy and guidance in the [Chapter
Handbook](Chapter_Leader_Handbook "wikilink").

# Why Contribute?

Besides supporting OWASP's very important mission to make software
security visible, chapter supporters are also:

  - Thanked for their support on the chapter home page and at chapter
    meetings they have supported
  - Invited to post any job openings they wish to advertise on the
    [local chapter email
    list](http://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-Portland). This
    email list has over 200 members coming from varied technical
    backgrounds.

<i>Please note that the chapter leadership makes its decisions on
speakers and meeting topics independently from knowledge of who supports
the chapter. That is, becoming a supporter does not guarantee you or
your organization a speaking opportunity or any other consideration.</i>

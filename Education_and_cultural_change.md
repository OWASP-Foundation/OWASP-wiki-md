Educating developers to write secure code is the paramount goal of a
secure code review. Taking code review from this standpoint is the only
way to promote and improve code quality. Part of the education process
is to empower developers with the knowledge in order to write better
code.
This can be done by providing developers with a controlled set of rules
which the developer can compare their code to. Automated tools provide
this functionality and also help reducing the overhead from a time
perspective. A developer can check his/her code using a tool without
much initial knowledge of the security concerns pertaining to their task
at hand. Also running a tool to assess the code if a fairly painless
task once the developer becomes familiar with the tool(s).

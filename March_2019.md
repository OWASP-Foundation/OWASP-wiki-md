## Old Business

Resolutions updates on

1.  Direct the Interim Executive Director to proceed with a registered
    trademark effort for the organization's identity and conferences in
    the United States, European Union, and the United Kingdom. The
    budget cap for this effort is $75,000.
      - The BoD has asked the Interim Executive Director to review
        possibilities reducing the perceived high costs by
          - Getting a quote with less research required
          - Getting a quote from a European based company
          - Estimating if it would be financial beneficial not to
            include UK trademark yet but to delay until Brexit
2.  Direct staff to implement an Attributed Giving policy that restricts
    donations and membership dues splits to gifts more than $25,000.
    This policy will, as soon as is practically possible, sunset the
    practice of allowing membership dues being allocated to chapters and
    projects.
      - The BoD has asked the Interim Executive Directory to come with a
        new proposal based on the discussion during the February public
        board call.
3.  Approve the [Draft 2019

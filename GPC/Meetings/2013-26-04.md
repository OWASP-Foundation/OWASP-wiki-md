## Currently Working On

  - **OWASP Marketing**
      - I worked with Sisterworks Publishing this week on organizing a
        webinar for our community.
      - They were meant to present their Phase 2 recommendations to us
        on Thursday during a live webinar.
      - Unfortunately, the presenters were not able to make it during
        the regular time.
      - I stepped in and presented their recommendations to the
        community.
      - [Sisterworks Publishing recommendations to
        OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/images/c/c5/OWASP_Recommendations-Presentation2-April24.pdf).

  - **Determining Active Project Status**
      - All existing project meta data has been entered into SalesForce.
      - There are still quite a few challenges with managing all of this
        data.
      - I've determined that we must first confirm that our Active
        projects are indeed Active, and that the named project leader is
        accurate as well.
      - I am reaching out to each leader individually to confirm these
        two key pieces of data for all 148 projects.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Projects at AppSec EU**
      - I have put together several communications pieces, instructions,
        forms, and scheduled deadlines for the AppSec EU Open Source
        Showcase (OSS).
      - As mentioned in my previous report, the local event organizers
        are already trying to allocate presenters for the OWASP Projects
        Track (OPT).
      - I don't anticipate needing to have a call for entries for the
        OPT, but I am prepared if we find we need to.

  - **Personal Development**
      - I am always looking for different ways of improving my skills so
        I have developed a list of personal development activities I
        wish to undertake for the year.
      - I have each activity separated into quarters.
      - This quarter, Q2, I am focusing on increasing my Information
        Security knowledge and understanding.
      - To do this, I am taking a 7 week course on [Information Security
        and Risk Management in
        Context](https://www.coursera.org/course/inforiskman).
      - The course is made available through Coursera.

  - **Daily Project based queries and requests**
      - This has not changed much since I began the post: questions are
        very similar in nature.

      - Funding queries.
      - Travel availability.
      - Project based administrative help.
      - Project status information.
      - Several project donations questions.
      - OWASP Social Media Updates.

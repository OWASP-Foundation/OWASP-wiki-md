## Currently Working On

  - **OWASP Asia Leadership Outreach Project**
      - This Asia Leadership Outreach Project came about during the
        discussion Dhillon and I had about OWASP at the Kuala Lumpur,
        Hack in the Box event.
      - He mentioned that he has offered OWASP a booth at the Kuala
        Lumpur, Hack in the Box event for a few years, but local
        chapters have not represented OWASP very well.
      - We suggested developing an OWASP Malaysia and Singapore outreach
        project that would involve a workshop, and the co-running of the
        Hack in the Box booth by members of both chapters.
      - I have put together a proposal where I outline a 3 day outreach
        initiative that aims to bring more experienced chapter leaders
        to the region for a workshop.
      - Read the [full
        proposal](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Projects/Asia_Leadership_Outreach_Proposal_2013)
        for more information.

  - **Development of Technical Project Advisor Requirements**
      - This item involves the new management work flow for project
        reviews that was proposed for 2013.
      - [Projects Review Process
        Proposal](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Projects/Reviews_Management_Proposal_2013)
      - It will involve a working group of technical project advisors
        headed by a member of the board.
      - The working group will be made up of the following areas: Secure
        Development, Secure Lifecycle Activity, Static Analysis, Dynamic
        Analysis, Governance, and Education.
      - These roles will be responsible for reviewing projects, and
        increasing the quality of the project review process and
        criteria.
      - I have put together experience requirements for each technical
        advisor volunteer role.
      - To read the full descriptions, please visit the [advisory role
        descriptions

<!-- end list -->

  - **Categorization of OWASP Projects**
      - I have begun categorizing our OWASP projects into the Builder,
        Breaker, and Defender categories.
      - Currently, our categorization is limited so I have begun to
        increase the search criteria for our projects.
      - Additionally, I have begun to label our projects based on OWASP
        Open SAMM criteria.
      - The labels are as follows: Governance, Construction,
        Verification, Deployment.
      - The plan is to allow users to find projects based on these
        labels on our projects wiki page.

<!-- end list -->

  - **Project Leader Responsibilities & Expectations**
      - I am currently working on putting together documentation that
        outlines a project leader's responsibilities, and our
        organizational expectations of them.
      - I am also developing a "How to run a successful OWASP project"
        document.
      - Jim and I are developing brand usage guidelines for our project
        leaders.
      - An OWASP project lifecycle info graphic is being developed as
        well.
      - I hope that these "How To" documents and graphics will help
        project leaders understand their responsibilities, and how to
        leverage the OWASP project infrastructure for success.

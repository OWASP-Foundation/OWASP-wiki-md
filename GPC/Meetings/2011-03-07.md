# Minutes

  - Meeting started: 21:00 GMT
  - Meeting adjourned: 23:00 GMT
  - [Update for April Board
    Meeting](https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=0AWvv_7Gz8Z7TZGdmOGZybWhfN2Z2YnB0NWMy&hl=en_US)

## Attendees

  - Jason Li (Chair)
  - Brad Causey (Committee Member)
  - Chris Schmidt (Committee Member)
  - Justin Searle (Committee Member)
  - Larry Casey (Committee Member)
  - Keith Turpin (Committee Member)
  - Paulo Coimbra (Projects Manager)
  - Kate Hartmann (Director of Operations)
  - Sarah Baso (observer)

## Notes

1.  Budget will be presented to Board by Jason
2.  PayPal Donation button should be incorporated into project homepage
    template
3.  Need to flesh out project migration strategy for projects to OWASP
    hosting
4.  Need to streamline or remove the release review process while still
    preserving the value of the process
5.  If Mainstream is the "top", project leaders will want a path to it -
    so we can't make "Mainstream" unattainable. Projects don't all
    *need* to be "enterprise ready" (currently the intention of
    "Mainstream"), but they don't necessarily want to be associated with
    "Labs". There's a difference between a stable project and a project
    that's willing to be "enterprise ready". Enterprise-ready projects
    need support staff and productization. New separate stage ("OWASP
    Enterprise")
6.  Do we want security reviews of projects?
      - Already part of requirements for stable releases, but has been a
        huge time sink in the past
      - Need to beware of time delay
      - Is there added value?
7.  Need a coverage map of OWASP projects to identify areas where OWASP
    is weak
      - Might lead to an OWASP "Suite" of projects?

## Decisions

1.  Chris, Justin and Larry have been formally seated as GPC members;
    Keith is awaiting additional nominations and has been named a
    provisional member
2.  LiveCD 2007 project page should be archived and marked inactive with
    reference pointer to current LiveCD (WTE) project
3.  Any approval step in the Incubator/Labs processes of the OWASP
    Projects Lifecycle will have an rolling approval window (i.e. if GPC
    does not take action within X time, it is automatically approved).
    This compromise prevents the GPC from becoming a bottleneck. Note
    this policy places extra burden on the GPC to get things right.

## Action Items

1.  Chris will reach out to ESAPI PHP project about project leadership
2.  Jason will work with Paulo to identify aspects of his workflow that
    can be automated
3.  Justin will research licensing issues for Projects and what would be
    involved in a license change (Sarah has volunteered to be a
    resource)
4.  Justin/Chris will sketch out an addition to the lifecycle process
    ("OWASP Enterprise")
5.  Jason will identify tools to help improve committee calls (e.g.
    Google Moderator, "talking stick")
6.  Jason will send Doodle for April meeting

Steps to starting a project (paraphrased from *draft* [Project
Handbook](http://sl.owasp.org/gpcws-jun11-projects-handbook#h.tao6g9hw1lup):

1.  Submitter sends request via: [new project request
    form](http://sl.owasp.org/new-project)
2.  Request generates an email to the GPC containing project submission
3.  *All* requests are held for a five day waiting period ("speedbump")
    for committee and community review/feedback. The proposal will be
    sent to the Global Projects Committee Mailing List:
    global-projects-committee@lists.owasp.org
4.  At the conclusion of the "speedbump" period, the project is created.

Steps to creating a project on the OWASP Wiki:

  - Determine Project Name (e.g. “OWASP Example Project”)
  - Create OWASP mailing list (e.g.
    <https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-example-project>)
  - Create Project Roadmap Page (e.g.
    <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Projects/OWASP_Example_Project/Roadmap>
    )
      - In this wiki page, paste the text from the Incubator Project
        Application (roadmap column J)
      - Save the wii page

<!-- end list -->

  - Create main project page (e.g.
    <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Example_Project> )
  - Use the following syntax (replace Projects/OWASP_Example_Project
    with the appropriate Project Metadata wiki page created above)

<!-- end list -->

    =Main=
    Project Leader’s content goes here

    =Project About=
    {{:Projects/OWASP_Example_Project}}

    [[Category:OWASP_Project|Category:OWASP Project]]

  - Create Project Metadata wiki page (e.g.
    <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Projects/OWASP_Example_Project> )
      - Type the syntax below and fill in details from the Incubator
        Project Application spreadsheet. It creates a Project About
        using this template:
        [Template:Project_About](Template:Project_About "wikilink")

<!-- end list -->

    {{Template:Project About
    | project_name =OWASP Example Project
    | project_home_page =OWASP Example Project
    | project_description =This is the description from column I of the Incubator Project Application spreadsheet
    | project_license =This is the license from column D of the Incubator Project Application spreadsheet
    | leader_name1 =This is the leader from column E of the Incubator Project Application spreadsheet
    | leader_email1 =This is the email @owasp.org created for the leader
    | leader_username1 =This is the wiki account for the leader
    | mailing_list_name = This is the full link to the mailing list (e.g. https://lists.owasp.org/mailman/listinfo/owasp-example-project)
    | project_road_map = This is name of the roadmap wiki page created in the previous step (e.g. Projects/OWASP_Example_Project/Roadmap)
    }}

  - Add the just created project to the Project Inventory Spreadsheet
    with all the relevant details, wiki page, etc.

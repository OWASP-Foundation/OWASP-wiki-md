# Background

The OWASP Foundation came online on December 1st 2001. It was
established as a 503(c) non-profit organization in the United States on
April 21, 2004 to ensure the ongoing availability and support for our
work at OWASP. OWASP is an international organization and the OWASP
Foundation supports OWASP efforts around the world. OWASP is an open
community dedicated to enabling organizations to conceive, develop,
acquire, operate, and maintain applications that can be trusted. All of
the OWASP tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to
anyone interested in improving application security. We advocate
approaching application security as a people, process, and technology
problem because the most effective approaches to application security
include improvements in all of these areas. Our central wiki can be
found at www.owasp.org.

OWASP is a new kind of organization. Our freedom from commercial
pressures allows us to provide unbiased, practical, cost-effective
information about application security. OWASP is not affiliated with any
technology company, although we support the informed use of commercial
security technology. Similar to many open-source software projects,
OWASP produces many types of materials in a collaborative, open way. The
OWASP Foundation is a not-for-profit entity that ensures the project's
long-term success.

Since its inception as a repository for application security knowledge
and information â€“ OWASP has grown into a haven for security research
tools and libraries aimed at helping organization improve the
application security stance. Many of OWASP's first successful projects
were documentation projects and as a result, our current infrastructure
was designed around hosting projects in wiki format. However, many of
our projects are now code-based tools or libraries and our current wiki
infrastruction does not give us the flexibility necessary to manage
these projects in a cohesive, reliable manner.

The OWASP Global Projects Committee is currently looking for proposals
to provide a cohesive project hosting framework for developers and
users.

# Description

Our envisioned project hosting solution encompasses not just basic
project management tools, but also an infrastructure to implement and/or
support our broader needs to publicize and promote OWASP projects.

## Basic Project Hosting Services

The following features are typical project hosting features that are
relatively self explanatory and we assume will generally be part of any
project hosting service proposal. Should any of these features not be
available, please explicitly note the feature in the proposal.

  - Issue Management
  - Software Configuration Management (e.g. CVS, Subversion, Git, etc)
      - Anonymous Read Access
      - Authenticated Commit Access
      - Granular Access Control for Committers (e.g. folder-level,
        file-level, branch-level)
  - Continuous Integration Build
  - Support for various languages including, but not limited to, C/C++,
    Java, .Net, ASP, and PHP
  - Project Metrics/Statistics for:
      - Downloads
      - Code Commits
      - Active Committers
      - Community Feedback Ratings
      - Average Issue Resolution Time
      - Open/Resolved Issue Counts

## Project Content Presentation Services

The following features are related to how OWASP projects are presented
and consumed to their user community. In general, while project services
and templates would be standardized and provisioned by the GPC, we would
like the use of such services in an individual project to be managed by
the project owner so that they can be relatively self sufficient.

##### OWASP Branded Project wiki home page

Currently, the OWASP wiki hosts everything from chapter meeting notes,
to informational articles, to project home pages. This has provided
project leaders with the flexibility to create their own content as
necessary to document and promote their project. However, the
uncoordinated structure means that there is often no centralized place
for project information. We have tried to address this by creating a
standardized wiki template (e.g. see an [example
template](Projects/Live_CD "wikilink")) but this template is tedious and
time consuming to maintain manually. Additionally, project leaders can
create wiki pages that end up clobbering or colliding with other
projects or initiatives.

We would like to have project home pages that are isolated from each
other and provides some consistent structure for basic project metadata,
while providing project leaders the freedom and flexibility to create
web content for their project as appropriate.

##### Mailing Lists / User Groups

All OWASP projects have individual mailing lists that are manually
provisioned using OWASP's MailMan instance. The mailing list
administrator must be manually set whenever a new project leader or core
contributor arises. While the infrastructure is solidly in place, the
process adds extra overhead to project management. Additionally, project
leaders who want specialized mailing lists (e.g. announcement-only lists
for patches) or other special requests add to the overhead.

We would like a service that provides some level of self-provisioning of
mailing lists for projects. This provisioning can be a service that
provisions default mailing lists automatically at project creation or
provides project owners the ability to self-provision desired mailing
lists within their project namespace.

##### Downloads Page

There is currently no consistent mechanism for OWASP projects to provide
project downloads. In some cases, leaders will upload project releases
to the OWASP wiki as "media files" and reference them in the wiki. In
other cases, they will provide links to external sites where project
releases can be downloaded. The inconsistency makes it difficult for
users to find OWASP project releases and also makes it impossible for us
to track the popularity (e.g. number of downloads) of OWASP projects.

We would like to have a project release download mechanism for projects
that allows us to track download statistics and also provides users a
consistent place to find project releases. Furthermore, this download
mechanism must support the ability to make large files available for
download. For example, the OWASP LiveCD distribution is several
gigabytes in size.

##### Native Language Documentation

The current OWASP wiki is not conducive to publishing native language
documentation, such a JavaDoc or PHPDoc, for our code-based projects.

We would like the project hosting service to support publication of such
documentation under a project's namespace as appropriate.

## Project Management Services

The following features relate to the ability of OWASP (and the GPC in
particular) to leverage the project hosting solution in support of the
OWASP mission.

##### Customizable (OWASP Branded) Projects Portal

With over 160 projects, we have a need to balance the visibility of
projects on our main page to promote both mature projects and those that
are still growing. Currently, OWASP projects are listed on the project
page in a somewhat ad-hoc manner that unfairly benefits established
projects. The sheer volume of projects also makes it extremely difficult
for potential users to navigate and find projects of interest.

We would like for any project hosting service to support the ability to
have a customizable, dynamically driven projects portal. This portal
would highlight projects on a rotating basis on customized selection
criteria. The portal should also allow users to search and navigate
projects based on function, category, classification (e.g. Incubator,
Labs, Mainstream, etc) and other similar project metadata. Ideally, the
infrastructure would support tagging projects with relevant keywords
which can then drive dynamic views of the portal.

##### Metrics Reporting

One of the reasons for gathering the metrics noted above (e.g.
downloads, user activity, community ratings, etc) is to help determine
projects in need of attention and identifying projects that have reached
a minimal level of maturity. In support of this goal, we would like any
project hosting solution to support the aggregation and reporting of
accumulated project metrics.

##### Per Project Feature Settings

OWASP hosts a variety of projects including documentation projects,
tools, and code libraries. Not every project will need native language
documentation publication features or continuous build integration.

We would like for any project hosting service to support adding or
disabling features that are relevant to a specific project.

##### Review Process

OWASP projects are periodically reviewed by community members for
maturity, quality, usability, etc. We would like for any project hosting
service to support a project review process by tracking progress and
lifecycle of formal reviews. Such a process may include capturing and
publishing feedback and quality metrics.

##### Hardened Security

As OWASP is an application security community, it would be hypocritical
of us to use a project hosting service that was not secure. We would
like for any project hosting service to have a concrete security plan
for a reliable, hardened hosting solution. Additionally, we would
appreciate (but do not require) the opportunity for our community to
test the security of any hosting solution in a controlled environment to
provide constructive feedback to the provider should their service be
chosen.

# Evaluation Criteria

The above features indicate our ideal goal for a project hosting service
solution. We recognize that not all features are necessarily feasible or
economical and fully expect that there may be some customization work to
be done (either by the provider or by us). All proposals will be given
consideration, though preference will be given to those proposals which
satisfy a majority of our feature requests. Additionally, as OWASP is a
503(c) non-profit organization consisting almost exclusively of
volunteers, proposals that offer services or products as donations to
the organization will be given preference. Any provider that donates
such services would be recognized as an OWASP Corporate Sponsor and such
services may be tax-deductible.

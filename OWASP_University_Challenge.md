<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The OWASP University Challenge is a one or two day mission style security challenge event during the AppSec conferences training days! University / Student teams can compete solving hack challenges and defending insecure applications.</p>
<h2 id="attack_defense_system">Attack-Defense System</h2>
<p><img src="Attack-Defense.png" title="fig:Attack-Defense.png" alt="Attack-Defense.png" />The challenges are even more dynamic and realistic now. Instead of just solving different security challenges, teams carry out a virtual online battle against each other in an attack-defense based competition, also known as CTF system. If you are interested to learn more about the CTF system, you will find here more information: <a href="http://www.hacking-lab-ctf.com">CTF System</a></p></td>

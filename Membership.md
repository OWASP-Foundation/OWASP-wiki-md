Software powers the world, but insecure software threatens safety,
trust, and economic growth. The Open Web Application Security Project
(OWASP) is dedicated to making application security visible by
empowering individuals and organizations to make informed decisions
about true application security risks.

OWASP boasts 46,000+ participants, more than 65 organizational
supporters, and even more academic supporters.

As a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit worldwide charitable organization, OWASP
does not endorse or recommend commercial products or services. Instead,
we allow our community to remain vendor neutral with the collective
wisdom of the best individual minds in application security worldwide.
This simple rule is the key to our success since 2001.

<b>Your individual and corporate membership powers the organization and
helps us [serve the
mission](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/About_The_Open_Web_Application_Security_Project).
Please consider becoming an OWASP member today\!</b>

# Testimonials

*“At a time when malicious attacks are intensifying and organizations
increasingly rely on applications with known and vulnerabilities to
fulfill their missions, OWASP is a vital part of defending the integrity
of businesses and institutions. We need strong DevOps and AppSec
communities to ensure the safety and security of commerce. We’re proud
to help OWASP fulfill that role.”*
**Brian Maccaba, CEO, Waratek**

*“Johnson Controls has been an innovator in the building and energy
efficiency industry since Warren Johnson’s invention of the electric
room thermostat over a century ago. With the functionality and
efficiency that technology has brought to building controls devices the
need for software security in embedded controls and the IoT is more
apparent than ever. Johnson Controls leverages several OWASP projects to
include the OWASP Top Ten and the Application Security Verification
Standard (ASVS) and others. Partnering with OWASP is a logical step
given our shared commitment to software security.”*
**Jason R. Rosselot, Director Global Product Security (GPS), Johnson
Controls**

*"The OWASP resources and tools have been instrumental in getting our
company going. We want to support the ongoing work."*
**Jacob Hansen, Cobalt.io**

*“We want to give back to the organization which has given the security
community at large so much. It's important that the OWASP mission
continue, and we wish to be a part of it.”*
**Kiran Sharma, Application Security Program –Lead, FICO**

“*OWASP’s AppSec events are one of the world’s most professional events,
gathering a top application security managerial and technical audience.
Ever since its foundation, Checkmarx has been supporting OWASP and has
enjoyed working closely with a hardworking, devoted and professional
team.*”

## 2018

### Owasp Houston April Chapter Meeting

**When:** Wed, April 25, 2018 6:30 PM – 8:30 PM

**Where:** PROS 3100 Main 2nd floor, Room B Houston, TX 77002

**Speaker:** Mahesh Babu, Head of Product Strategy, Contrast Security

> Mahesh is responsible for growing Contrast Protect. He takes every
> opportunity to tell everyone how Contrast has fundamentally changed
> application security for the first time since he started working in
> security 10+ years ago. Mahesh has seen the industry evolve as a
> researcher, consultant, and practitioner within a large bank. He began
> his career as a security researcher at the CERIAS center at Purdue
> University. He then went on to build and scale large security &
> privacy programs a Senior Manager & architect for HSBC Information
> Security & Risk. He also spent time as a consultant at Deloitte and
> Booz & Company. Mahesh has a BS in Computer Science and MS in
> Information Security from Purdue University and an MBA from Duke
> University.

**Title:** A phased approach to building security automation into your
CI/CD

> So your engineering team is using CI / CD and churning out code at a
> frenetic pace. It is unclear where the risk is, what controls to focus
> on and where in the SDLC to introduce those controls. Mahesh will
> introduce a practical, risk-based approach to introducing security
> automation into the CI / CD pipeline to surface critical issues,
> shorten remediation time without bottlenecking the release. Finally,
> he will touch on the concepts of interactive analysis (IAST) and
> runtime protection (RASP) as key tools in this approach.

> of technology features and functions. In this talk Checkmarx discusses
> how Application Security can actually help drive an organization's
> bottom line and internal processes. In this age of ever expanding risk
> to organizations, Application Security can be used to expand your
> customer base, drive compliance, and expand the knowledge of an
> organization's executives and employees.

DefectDojo

> DefectDojo was created in 2013 when one security engineer at Rackspace
> stupidly opened his mouth in front of his leadership team.
> Vulnerability management is traditionally tedious, time consuming, and
> mentally draining. DefectDojo attempts to streamline vulnerability
> management with automation centered around templating, report
> generation, metrics, scanner consolidation, and baseline self-service
> tools. DefectDojo is currently used by multiple large enterprises and
> has core contributors from five different companies. It has made
> several engineers' lives much easier, and it can help you too. Got a
> ton of findings to consolidate and report on? DefectDojo has you
> covered. Need to have a dashboard of your team’s work? DefectDojo has
> you covered. Tired of boilerplate report generation? DefectDojo does
> that for you. Come check out how to make vulnerability management less
> painful and speed up your appsec program in this talk with demo.

> extraction feature. This talk will utilize the Python scripting
> language primary for dynamic analysis, but the examples used in the
> talk should be easily transferable into the other scripting
> languages.
> Adam is an independent information security consultant, who is
> pursuing his PhD in Computer Science under the supervision of Dr. Dan
> Wallach at Rice University. He is also an active contributor to the
> radare reverse engineering framework, where he has contributed support

> build internal security testing standards and guidelines, developing
> tools, and executing engagements at Praetorian. Adam consults on a
> wide range of topics that including code reviews, threat modeling, and
> software penetration testing. Additionally, he has also presented on a
> wide range of information security topics as a lecturer and instructor
> in public, private, and academic settings.

**Title:** WAF bypassing, breaking client-side validation, and advanced
SQL injection obsfucation

> The first bandaid that web app administrators typically apply to their
> site is a web application firewall. Most lack the technical skill set
> to tune it properly, or leave default settings "as is". Whitelists can
> be difficult to customize appropriately and blacklists usually fall
> prey to persistent attackers. Spoiler alert: All WAF's can be
> bypassed. This becomes even more devastating when the WAF is the only
> line of defense. This presentation will focus on injection
> obfuscation, and include a few cool tricks for bypassing pesky WAF
> blacklists and filters that I've come across on my journey to become a
> more thorough penetration tester.

**Speaker:** Daniel Buentello

**Title:** Weaponizing your Coffee Pot

> As SoC price continue to drop and their implementation continues to
> rise, connected “”appliances”" (Internet of Things)will become an
> attractive avenue for cybercriminals. Due to the fact they provide no
> traditional feedback (monitor) or input (mouse/keyboard) If one were
> able to compromise an embedded host it would be the perfect vantage
> point for a MITM attack or a beachhead to launch other attacks. I plan
> to guide you through some of the steps from initial reconnaissance to
> building binaries for different architectures. Then end goal being to
> take over the host without breaking designed functionality (stealthy),
> being able to run third-party binaries at the start (lethal), and
> surviving basic removal techniques (persistent) aka weaponizing.

**Title:** Can You Hear Me Now?

> Leveraging Mobile Devices on Pentests BYOD is not a new concept. From
> contractor laptops to an employee’s game console in the break room, a
> compromised device in the corporate environment can lead to all sorts
> of bad things. In this talk we will look at the unique threats that
> BYOD for mobile devices brings to the table. The most security
> conscious corporations are deploying the latest devices and policies
> to stop attackers from breaching the perimeter and if they do to stop
> data exfiltration. We will discuss how mobile devices on a corporate
> network and/or handling company data undermines these efforts. We will
> look at multiple mobile platforms gathering sensitive information,
> attacking other devices such as other mobile devices, servers, and
> workstations, and using out of band communication to perform data
> exfiltration and communicate with internal devices. Multiple live demo
> scenarios will be shown and some useful code for pentesters will be
> released.

**Speaker:** Clint Pollock

> Clint Pollock is a Senior Solutions Architect at Veracode. Since 1997,
> he has also created security solutions for large-scale enterprise
> environments on behalf of CREDANT Technologies and Netegrity. In his
> current role, Clint helps globally distributed organizations evaluate,
> track, and mitigate their application security risk. Clint’s greatest
> strengths are his enthusiasm, experience and determination to help
> customers succeed in maintaining secure, compliant systems, and avoid
> the consequences and bad headlines that come with application security
> breaches.

**Title:** Tips for Building a Successful Application Security Program
Application

> Vulnerabilities are steeply on the rise. At $350 billion per year
> software is the largest manufacturing industry in the world yet there
> are no uniform standards or insight into security, risk or liability
> of the final product. The development environment is becoming
> increasingly complex – application origin ranges from internally
> developed code, outsourced, 3rd party, Open Source, and Commercial Off
> the Shelf software. Ensuring these entities are creating secure
> software is becoming a daunting task. Lots of emphasis is placed on IT
> controls, patching, etc, but the new attack vector is your
> applications. During this presentation we will recap the state of
> software security today and discuss detailed actions you can take to
> build a successful application security program that is centralized,
> policy-driven, and comprehensive.

> language called XPath and discover how it, too, can be susceptible to
> injection attacks. Using the "XMLmao" testbed from the Magical Code
> Injection Rainbow suite, attendees will learn hands-on how to perform
> XPath injection attacks.
> We will also have a copy of the testbed running on some virtual
> machines for everyone to test out after the workshop.

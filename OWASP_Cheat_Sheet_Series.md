<p>The OWASP Cheat Sheet Series was created to provide a concise collection of high value information on specific application security topics. These cheat sheets were created by various application security professionals who have expertise in specific topics. We hope that the OWASP Cheat Sheet Series provides you with excellent security guidance in an easy to read format.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the OWASP Cheat Sheet Series, please email the project leader <a href="mailto:jim.manico@owasp.org">Jim Manico</a>, contact us on the project's Slack channel, or on our <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/forum/#!forum/cheat-sheets-project">Google Group</a> (<strong>Slack is highly preferred over the Google Group</strong>).</p>
<p>The archives of the old mailing list can be consulted <a href="https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-cheat-sheets/index">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="official_website">Official website</h2>
<p>The official website on which all the cheat sheets are hosted is <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org">https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org</a> .</p>
<h2 id="migration_to_github">Migration to GitHub</h2>
<p>Project has been fully migrated to <a href="https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>This page is used as the OWASP homepage of the project, all the project content is hosted on the <a href="https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries">GitHub repository</a> and we work <strong>only from</strong> this repository, <strong>wiki is not used anymore</strong>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries">GitHub</a> repository is used for the work on the cheat sheets and the released ones are deployed on the <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org">official website</a>.</p>
<p>So, from now, only a GitHub account is needed to contribute :)</p>
<h2 id="bridge_between_the_projects_owasp_proactive_controlsowasp_application_security_verification_standard_and_owasp_cheat_sheet_series">Bridge between the projects OWASP Proactive Controls/OWASP Application Security Verification Standard and OWASP Cheat Sheet Series</h2>
<p>A work channel has been created between these 2 projects and the Cheat Sheet Series using the following process (<em>OPC = OWASP Proactive Controls / OASVS = OWASP Application Security Verification Standard / OCS = OWASP Cheat Sheet</em>):</p>
<ul>
<li>When a Cheat Sheet is missing for a point in OPC/OASVS then the OCS will handle the missing and create one. When the Cheat Sheet is ready then the reference is added by OPC/OASVS.</li>
<li>If a Cheat Sheet exists for an OPC/OASVS point but the content do not provide the expected help then the Cheat Sheet is updated to provide the content needed/expected.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason of the creation of this bridge is to help the OCS/OASVS projects by providing them:</p>
<ul>
<li>A consistent source for the requests regarding new Cheat Sheets.</li>
<li>Same approach about the update of the existing Cheat Sheets.</li>
<li>A usage context for the Cheat Sheet and a quick source of feedack about the quality and the efficiency of the Cheat Sheet.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is not mandatory that a request for a new Cheat Sheet (or for an update) come only from OPC/OASVS, it is just a extra channel.</p>
<pre><code>Requests from OPC/OASVS are flagged with a special label in the GitHub repository issues list in order to identify them and set them as a top level priority.</code></pre>

# Roadmap

Roadmap is managed using the [GitHub
feature](https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/projects/1) of the
repository.

# Project Logo

**Project is now finished, we let the specification online for further
evolution of the logo.**

Big thanks to Amélie Didion for the design work.

## Logo files

Logo files are hosted on the official OWASP dedicated [Github
repository](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-swag/tree/master/projects/cheat-sheet-series).

Logo n°1:

Logo n°2:

[2](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-swag/blob/master/projects/cheat-sheet-series/owasp-2.png)

## Objective

This section contains the information that we have gathered and plan to
use for the creation of the project logo and related design materials.

The first phase of the work is to commission a project logo.

## Phase 1: Logo

### Introduction

The project requires a logo which will comprise three components:

  - Graphical element indicating the idea or use of the cheat sheets
  - The project title
  - Motto/straplines.

Not all of these will necessarily be shown together at the same time.
Phase 1 requires the creation of a logo, which may be used with one, two
or all three of these components.

The logo will be used in many ways such as on a website banner, or just
the graphical element on a bag, or the graphical element and a
motto/strapline on a t-shirt. These other outputs are not included in
the scope of Phase 1.

### Project Name

The project name is *OWASP Cheat Sheet Series project*. The project name
will be positioned next to the graphical element in some outputs, and
this layout must be provided. In other cases, the project name will not
be included beside the logo.

### Motto/Strapline

Three mottos/straplines will be used in the logo - they are context
dependent:

  - *Life is too short, AppSec is tough, Cheat\!*
  - *Its not cheating if you do it for the right reasons*
  - *Sometimes the only good thing to do is cheat*.

The logo layout must allow for any of these or none to be included.

### Layout, Media Formats and Colours

Some media or placements may mean the motto/strapline does not fit or is
not needed. Therefore the logo must be usable with, or without, the
motto/strapline.

The logo will need to be used at multiple scales. For example, if the
logo is square excluding the motto/strapline, the following formats must
work

  - Low-resolution use on web pages (e.g. as small as 100x100 pixels
    excluding moto/strapline)
  - Medium resolution use on fabric such as t-sirts or bags (e.g.
    900x900 pixels at 150 dpi)
  - High-resolution use on large posters and banners (e.g. as large as
    5,000x5,000 pixels at 300dpi).

The logo may be printed in CMYK for physical media, but must also have
RGB colours for screen use. Additionally the logo must also be available
in grayscale, and separately as single colour (i.e. black and white
without any tones).

### Deliverables Required

All outputs must be provided digitally:

1.  Logo demonstrating how it looks with just the graphical element, the
    graphical element with the project title, and the graphical element
    with each of the mottos/straplines, and everything together
2.  Source layered vector graphic files created in Adobe Illustrator
3.  Exported versions for quick use low, medium and high resolution
    full-colour PNG/JPEGs in RGB and CMYK
4.  Colour and font specification.

Rights/licensing:

1.  The designer will not retain any rights - all design and use rights
    will be given to OWASP, who will publish the logo and files using am
    open source licence, and OWASP will be able to use the logo, source
    files, ideas, designs in any manner it desires in any media in any
    quantity, without any additional payments, commission or royalties
    to the designer or anyone else
2.  All fonts used in the design must be provided to OWASP and comply
    with the above requirements

## Future Phases: Other Graphical Elements

Scope TBC - Banners, t-shirts, etc

Background pictures (picture provider and designer will be cited on the
project site):

  - *A smart tech looking woman reading a piece of paper (the
    cheatsheet) while resting on a beach.*
  - *A woman hand holding cards with an ace up the sleeve.*

Pictures proposal (just a proposal as bootstrap, others pictures can be
used):

  - Cards:

# Community Engagement Funding

Successful global outreach and community support are critical activities
that support our purpose of driving visibility and evolution of safety
and security of the worlds software. To this end, some guidelines have
been established for the OWASP community leadership to follow as they
support the OWASP Foundation and itâ€™s core purpose.

  - Payments are [tracked
    online](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Community_Engagement_-_Payments)

Be sure to read the full process below to ensure a smooth and timely
transaction. There's a new and improved reimbursement process - [full
details including screenshots for every
role](Reimbursement_Process_Details "wikilink").

  - First check the Chapter and "Project Funding Totals" below under
    "Additional Resources" to make sure you know what is in your Project
    or Chapter's available funds
  - Ready to make a request? **[REQUEST FUNDING
    PRE-APPROVAL](https://owasporg.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/4/group/14)**
  - Already approved? Submit receipts for reimbursement with our
    **[REIMBURSEMENT SUBMISSION
    FORM](https://owasporg.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/4/group/9)**
  - Need to see past requests? See this
    [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yoTx7NM3yjLvenLn_226nq4uM-G2TnByOokhexTPWB0/edit).

**Please note: Payments are made twice per month and may take up to 20
days depending on time of submission.**

## Types of Activity Supported

The Board of Directors approved a motion at the October 14, 2015 board
meeting that any request for funding that has been approved for one
chapter or project, can be considered an acceptable expense for all
chapters or projects. If you have an account balance which covers that
expense in full, then the item should be considered pre-approved for
spending. See **[Community Engagement
Payments](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Community_Engagement_-_Payments)**
for a list of previously approved expenses. If you do not see a
comparable expense or expense category or aren't sure your expense is
pre-approved, you must submit a request for approval via the [Request
Funding
Pre-Approval](https://owasporg.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/4/group/14)
form before requesting reimbursement.

## Community Engagement Funding Rules

The following rules apply for community engagement funding:

  - Funding opportunities are available to chapter or project leaders
    and active OWASP members.
  - All funding requests MUST be pre-approved. This is necessary for
    global budgeting.
  - Requested funds will first be deducted from the local chapter or
    project budget.
  - A chapter or project without sufficient funds may request funding
    from the foundation "Community Engagement" budget. These funds are
    available on a first come-first serve basis.
  - The standard funding thresholds are listed above based on the type
    of activity.

<!-- end list -->

  - <strong>Community Engagement funds cannot be used by speakers to
    attend OWASP conferences</strong>. Under extreme circumstances an
    exception may be requested by [Contacting
    Us](https://owasporg.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/7/group/18/create/72).

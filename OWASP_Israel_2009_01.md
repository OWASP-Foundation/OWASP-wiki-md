    The challenge in implementing Web Application Firewalls is proper
    performance testing to validate true performance while ensuring that
    proper security policies are in place. The presentation will discuss
    ways to test the performance and the security of Web Application
    Firewall for better network capacity planning and proper deployment
    in production networks.

    Not a future but a present, Web 2.0 technologies and services are
    here to stay. Prophecies of Web 2.0 insecurity are age old, but only
    now real threats such as the recent [Twitter JSON
    bug](http://www.xiom.com/whid-2009-4) start to emerge. Nimrod will
    prove by using real world stories and demos how insecure Web 2.0
    applications can be.
    Nimrod Luria is an acclaimed application security expert who has
    recently founded Qrity, a promising startup. Previously he was a
    member of Microsoft ACE team.
  - Wiki Security, Ofer Shezaf, Xiom
    ([download](http://www.xiom.com/research/wiki_security))
    Wiki is a revolutionary tool for creation and sharing of content by
    a team. To be revolutionary it needs to make radical changes from
    prevailing paradigms, and one of the key changes is in its security
    model: Wiki forgo with traditional authorization for revision
    control. The presentation will discuss this new security model as
    well as what it required in regard to more traditional application
    security issues.
    Ofer Shezaf is the leader of OWASP Israel. Ofer is the fonder of
    Xiom, a web application firewall research, services and support
    company. Previously Ofer served as VP of Product Management and VP
    of Security Research at Breach Security, a web application firewalls
    vendor.

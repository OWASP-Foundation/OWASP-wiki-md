## Cryptographic Elections - How to Simultaneously Achieve Verifiability and Privacy

Advances in computer technology have created the illusion that
electronic means would bring us closer to achieving improved voting
systems. However, if not designed properly, electronic elections carry
more risk than reward. The core of the problem is that computers cannot
be trusted, both because of malicious software, and because code
verification is effectively infeasible. Needless to say that this
reduces the trust in the result of the election, and may have disastrous
consequences.

In this talk I will survey the saga of electronic elections in the
United States, and use it to motivate the concept of "software
independence" (Rivest and Wack '06). I will then describe how modern
cryptographic techniques can be harnessed in order to implement election
mechanisms that enable both public verifiability and ballot secrecy.
This is a combination that cannot be achieved by other means.

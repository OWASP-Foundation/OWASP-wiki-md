# 4\. Governance and control

## Security Strategy

Noteworthy, although two thirds of organizations are using technical
tools to support their programs, only about 57% have a documented
application security strategy to guide their program decisions. The
median of security strategy timespans lies at 1 year, with about half of
the organizations with security strategy timespans of 1 year or less and
the other half with 2 years or more. As noted in the section on
investments, interestingly we noted that there appears to be a
correlation “sweet spot” for increasing your security budget if you use
a planning horizon of two years (but note, we did not see additional
budget advantages when going beyond the 2 years horizon.).

## Alignment and review of the security strategy

An interesting observation is further: although the far majority have
reviewed and updated their strategy within the past 12 months, yet, only
half of the security strategies are aligned or integrated with the
organization’s business strategy and only half outline the key security
activities for the next 12 months. Considering that CISOs see as one of
their challenges an awareness gap of senior management for security
topics, it might be a good idea to build that bridge from both ends:
sharpen awareness for security issues and also at the same time align
the security strategy with the business strategy, thus making it more
relevant for day-to-day business decisions.

| And of those with an application security strategy, this strategy           |     |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| … has been reviewed and updated within the past 12 months                   | 76% |
| … is aligned with, or integrated into, the organization's IT strategy       | 65% |
| … is aligned with, or integrated into, the organization's business strategy | 53% |
| … outlines our key security activities for the next 12 months               | 51% |

## Do strategies address new technology risks, related to social networking, personal devices, or cloud?

The question is not only whether your strategy is up-to-date and aligned
with your business strategy, but there are constantly new risks arising
and we asked CISOs how confident they are that their current strategy is
addressing new risks associated with the increased use of social
networking, personal devices, or cloud. And only one third found their
strategy sufficient, while two thirds either need to investigate or
modify how these new technology risks affect their security and security
strategy.

## Use of Application Security Management Systems (ASMS) and Maturity Models

We also noted that only a small portion of CISO are currently using an
ASMS or maturity models to assess their security status and develop
their security roadmap or strategy based on that assessment. In fact
only one in four is using or in the process of currently implementing an
ASMS.

![<File:CISO_Survey_2013_16b_ASMS_or_MM.png>](CISO_Survey_2013_16b_ASMS_or_MM.png
"File:CISO_Survey_2013_16b_ASMS_or_MM.png")

This is interesting, as some may argue that it is vital to understand
your current position in order to formulate an adequate security
strategy going forward. However, ASMS and maturity models come in many
different shapes and sizes and some of them can require great effort
just for getting this first assessment.

(On a personal note: I found the OWASP openSAMM a very fast and
lightweight maturity model to get that first assessment with a just few
hours on an afternoon with some of my CISO clients. And building on that
you can develop your security roadmap very quickly. And you may notice
that openSAMM is still used in only very few organizations as you can
see from the following graph.)

## Frameworks and Security Management Systems used by organizations

Going beyond the maturity models, we also wanted to see which systems
are used at the moment by organizations. And clearly the ISO 2700x
standards are most common, used by nearly half of the organizations. But
using a maturity model seems today to be still an exotic approach,
practiced by only a minority.

## Assessing the quality and effectiveness of application security

And although the use of external frameworks is relatively low, the vast
majority (85%) of organizations are performing assessments of their
application security in one way or the other. Most of them through
internal self-assessments by IT or application security functions.

## The CISO role: scope and areas of responsibility

And last but not least, we also took a closer look at the role and
responsibilities of the CISO. They seem to still vary a great deal
between organizations and across industries. So we were curious as to
the current extend of the surveyed CISOs areas of responsibility and
especially as to how far her/his domain is stretching when it comes to
application security related questions.

Interestingly while CISOs find policies and metrics close to their desk,
nearly one third of the CISOs find secure development processes (SDLC)
outside of their area of responsibility, and nearly one fourth of the
CISOs have security training and awareness not in their area of
responsibility. These aspects might be due to delegation to other
application stakeholders and/or lower levels of functional management.
They could also indicate a gap in aligning CISO responsibilities on
application security within risk management, governance and compliance.
It will be interesting to see whether the CISO role will further evolve
over time when revisiting the CISO role and responsibilities in the next
iteration of the CISO survey in 2014.

    *Abstract:* This talk intends to demonstrate how to improve web
    application security testing by combining browser automation
    framework and web proxy API.
    The goal of this research is to bring a web proxy as close as
    possible to a browser to achieve a better security testing coverage,
    especially when dealing with complex client-side technology.
    The presentation includes a montage of real case scenarios, showing
    how this approach can lead to the discovery of vulnerabilities which
    might otherwise go unnoticed.
    *Bio:* Roberto loves breaking applications for fun and profit. In
    the last years, Roberto has been involved in the infosec community
    by founding the OWASP New Zealand chapter and by publishing
    vulnerabilities affecting major software products. Roberto has been
    a guest speaker at global security conferences, including HITB,
    EUSecWest, DEFCON, Ruxcon, Kiwicon and HackPra AllStars.

  - 20h00 - 20h15: **Break**
  - 20h15 - 21h15: **[If You Tolerate This, Your Child Processes Will Be
    Next](https://www.owasp.org/images/c/cc/Ifyoutoleratethisyourchildprocesseswillbenext.pdf)**
    (by Bart Leppens)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    *Abstract:* Browser 0-days are very expensive and thus not available
    for the common attacker. Therefore an attacker may switch his focus
    from exploiting the browser towards exploiting the browser's
    internal network infrastructure. A normal webbrowser can serve as a
    pivot to attack the company's internal network. Internal networks
    are generally less protected and are potentially less segregated in
    terms of security, so pivoting through the browser can help the
    attacker to reach those otherwise unreachable targets.
    The Browser Exploitation Framework, aka BeEF, is a professional
    security tool that can help you during a pentest performing these
    kinds of attacks.
    *Bio:* Bart Leppens is one of the BeEF developers. During his talk
    he will introduce you to BeEF, Inter-Protocol Communication (IPC) &
    Inter-Protocol Exploitation (IPE). If you're thinking about buying
    an expensive firewall, it's advisable to wait until after his talk.
    There is a risk you might want to throw it all away.

  -
    There is a way to build common, classic web applications. You know,
    servers, databases, some HTML and a bit of JavaScript. Ye olde way.
    Grandfather still knows. And there is a way to build hip and fancy,
    modern and light-weight, elastic and scalable client-side web
    applications. Sometimes with a server in the background, sometimes
    with a database - but all the hard work is done by something new:
    JavaScript Model-View-Controller and templating frameworks.
    Angular, Ember and CanJS, Knockout, Handlebars and Underscore...
    those aren't names of famous wrestlers but modern JavaScript
    fame-works that offer a boost in performance and productivity by
    taking care of many things web-app right there in the browser, where
    the magic happens. And more and more people jump on the bandwagon
    and implement those frameworks with great success. High time for a
    stern look from the security perspective, ain't it not?
    This talk will show you how those frameworks work, how secure their
    core is and what kind of security issues spawn from the generous
    feature cornucopia they offer. Do their authors really know the DOM
    well enough to enrich it with dozens of abstraction layers? Or did
    they open a gate straight to JavaScript hell introducing a wide
    range of new injection bugs and coding worst-practices? Well, you'll
    know after this talk. You'll know...
    [Mario Heiderich](http://heideri.ch) is founder of the German/UK
    pen-test outfit Cure53 and a Microsoft security contractor. He
    focuses on HTML5, SVG security, script-less attacks and believes XSS
    can be eradicated by using JavaScript. Maybe. Some day. Actually
    quite soon. Mario invoked the HTML5 security cheat-sheet, the Alexa
    Top 1x search engine Crawly and several other projects. In the
    remaining time he delivers trainings and security consultancy for
    larger German and international companies for sweet sweet money and
    the simple minded fun in breaking things. Mario has spoken on a
    large variety of international conferences - both academic and
    industry-focused, co-authored two books, several academic papers and
    doesn't see a problem in his one year old son having a tablet
    already. There you have it.

    Using static analysis to identify software bugs is not a new
    paradigm. For years, developers have used static analysis tools to
    identifying code quality issues. While these tools may not be
    specifically designed for identifying security bugs. This
    presentation will discuss how custom security rules can be added to
    existing code quality tools to identify potential software security
    bugs. Writing custom software security rules for the popular Java
    code scanning tool PMD will be the focus of the presentation.
    Justin Clarke is a Director and Co-Founder of Gotham Digital
    Science. He is the lead author/technical editor of "SQL Injection
    Attacks and Defense" (Syngress), co-author of "Network Security
    Tools" (O'Reilly), contributor to "Network Security Assessment, 2nd
    Edition" (O'Reilly), as well as a speaker at numerous security
    conferences and events such as Black Hat, EuSecWest, ISACA, BruCON,
    OWASP AppSec, OSCON, RSA and SANS. Justin is the Chapter Leader for
    the OWASP London chapter in the United Kingdom.

    Applications](https://www.owasp.org/images/d/d1/Owasp_be_Vulnerability_Prediction_in_Android_Apps.pdf)**
    (by Aram Hovsepyan, Ph. D.)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    We present an approach to predict which components of a software
    system contain security vulnerabilities. Prediction models are a key
    instrument to identify the weak spots that deserve special scrutiny.
    Our approach is based on text mining the source code of an
    application. We have explored the potential of the bag-of-words
    representation and discovered that a dependable prediction model can
    be built by means of machine learning techniques. In a validation
    with 10 Android applications we have obtained performance results
    that often outclass state-of-the-art approaches.

### PROGRAM

The agenda:

  - 18h00 - 18h30: **Welcome & sandwiches**
  - 18h30 - 18h45: **OWASP Update** (by Lieven Desmet, OWASP Belgium
    Board)
  - 18h45 - 19h45: **25 Years of Vulnerabilities** (by Yves Younan,
    Senior Research Engineer at Sourcefire)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    This talk will take a look into the interesting world of
    vulnerability statistics. We have examined data for the last 25
    years and used it to map out trends and general information on
    vulnerabilities in software. Some of the questions we look at are
    "What were the most popular vulnerabilities? Which had the most
    impact? Which vendors and products suffered from the most issues?
    Etc. While some of the statistics are predictable, others are
    surprising. This data was first introduced at RSA Conference San
    Francisco 2013.
    **Dr. Yves Younan** is a Senior Research Engineer in the
    Vulnerability Research Team (VRT) at Sourcefire where he works on
    vulnerabilities and mitigations. Prior to joining Sourcefire, he
    worked as a Security Researcher with BlackBerry Security at Research
    In Motion. Before joining RIM, he was an academic, founding the
    Native Code Security group within the DistriNet research group at
    the KU Leuven in Belgium. He received a Master's degree in Computer
    Science from the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) and a PhD in
    Engineering: Computer Science from KU Leuven. His PhD focused on
    building efficient mitigations against vulnerability exploitation,
    several practical mitigations were published and presented at
    international conferences.

  - 20h00 - 21h00: **Banking Security: Attacks and Defences** (by Steven
    Murdoch, Senior Researcher at University of Cambridge)

<!-- end list -->

  -
    Designers of banking security systems are faced with a difficult
    challenge of developing technology within a tightly constrained
    budget, yet which must be capable of defeating attacks by
    determined, well-equipped criminals. This talk will summarise
    banking security technologies for protecting Chip and PIN/EMV card
    payments, online shopping, and online banking. The effectiveness of
    the security measures will be discussed, along with vulnerabilities
    discovered in them both by academics and by criminals. These
    vulnerabilities include cryptographic flaws, failures of tamper
    resistance, and poor implementation decisions, and have led not only
    to significant financial losses, but in some cases unfair allocation
    of liability. Proposed improvements will also be described, not only
    to the technical failures but also to the legal and regulatory
    regimes which are the underlying reason for some of these problems
    not being properly addressed.
    **Dr. Steven J. Murdoch** is a Royal Society University Research
    Fellow in the Security Group of the University of Cambridge Computer
    Laboratory, working on developing metrics for security and privacy.
    His research interests include covert channels, banking security,
    anonymous communications, and censorship resistance. Following his
    PhD studies on anonymous communications, he worked with the OpenNet
    Initiative, investigating Internet censorship. He then worked for
    the Tor Project, on improving the security and usability of the Tor
    anonymity system. Currently he is supported by the Royal Society on
    developing methods to understand complex system security. He is also
    working on analyzing the security of banking systems especially Chip
    & PIN/EMV, and is Chief Security Architect of Cronto, an online
    authentication technology provider.

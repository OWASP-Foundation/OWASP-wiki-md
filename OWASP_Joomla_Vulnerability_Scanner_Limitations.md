## Limitations on Current Release

  - The vulnerability database still lacks of unknown exploit checks. If
    the exploit check is not available, the scanner verify based on
    deduced version. If deduced version is not available, it then cannot
    verify the vulnerability
  - The Scanner lacks IDS evasion bypass
  - The Scanner lacks sophisticated fuzzing
  - The Scanner is not a full fledged SQL Injection tool

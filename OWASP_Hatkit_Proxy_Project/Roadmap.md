### Some ideas/improvements:

  - Improve TCP-interception capabilities, largely by working on the UI.
  - Improve TCP-interception by adding database storage of tcp traffic
    aswell.
  - Implement support for intercepting WebSockets (although this
    probably will have to be performed on the Owasp Proxy part).
  - Implement asynchronous sockets using NIO (although this probably
    will have to be performed on the Owasp Proxy part).
  - Improve HTTP/HTML syntax highlightning by implementing JSON lexer.

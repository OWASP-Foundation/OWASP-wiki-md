# Minutes

(Meeting started 9pm GMT)

  - Board has voted and approved creating OWASP Grant framework. SoC
    will operate as a specialized initiative under the Grant framework.
    GPC will take existing SoC Framework and generalize it to create
    OWASP Grant Framework. Grant framework will be applied to all grants
    (including things like ESAPI and ISWG).
  - Board has voted and approved on reserving a space on every project
    page that will be under the control of the GPC/Board to organize
    information about the project and its quality status
  - Board has voted and approved that SoC will be launched at OWASP
    AppSec Europe 2009
  - Board has voted and approved action to reclaim inactive projects for
    new owners (or for removal) pending an additional two weeks for
    project updates.
  - Board has voted and approved proposal to evaluate projects across
    versions and status ([Project
    Governance](Project_Governance "wikilink"))
  - Project contributors will be for specific versions. This allows
    contributors to remain recognized for their work, but keeps the
    contributions relevant for recent versions
  - Release tables need to be added to encapsulate release assessments
  - GPC will explore creating a pool of reviewer (incentives, roles,
    etc)
  - GPC will send out periodic meeting notes to leader's list to keep
    everyone apprised of what we're doing

(Meeting ended 10pm GMT)

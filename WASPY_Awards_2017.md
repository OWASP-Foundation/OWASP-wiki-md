## Purpose of the Awards

Each year there are many individuals who do amazing work, dedicating
countless hours to share, improve, and strengthen the OWASP mission.
Some of these individuals are well known to the community while others
are not. 

**The purpose of these awards is to bring recognition to those who "FLY
UNDER THE RADAR". These are the individuals who are passionate about
OWASP, who contribute hours of their own free time to the organization
to help improve the cyber-security world, yet seem to go
unrecognized.**

## **New Voting for This Year**

In the past, we have struggled with the WASPY Awards becoming a
popularity contest with mainly only well known individuals winning. 
Popularity contests alienate the work of the people we are trying to
recognize for these awards.

This year, in an attempt to keep WASPYs from only going to high-profile
community members and get back to the roots of the award--recognizing
“unsung hero’s” for their contributions to the Foundation-- we have
changed the way WASPYs are awarded.  

This year all community members were encouraged to nominate a person for
each category whose awesome work makes OWASP a better place.  Then,
members of the staff and Board will each get a vote for each category. 
Our goal is that by avoiding the tendency to vote only for names you
might have heard of, we will instead have votes cast solely on the
merits that each person was nominated for.

## Categories

The WASPYs celebrate the actors in our community who grow OWASP and
drive innovation to the safety and security of the world’s software.
This year we are excited to offer three categories.
**Best Community Supporter** - The WASPY for COMMUNITY honors members
who create dynamic INTERACTION and LEARNING opportunities for the OWASP
Community.  Nominees to the Community WASPY Award create collaborative
and inclusive environments and grow the OWASP Community.  WASPYs focus
on the unsung heros of the OWASP community.  Chapter Leaders and
Community Members should especially consider leaders and volunteers who
bring something extra to the environment, help the chapter reach out to
new attendees, or carry out the tedious and repetitive tasks that make
growing an OWASP Chapter possible.
**Best Mission Outreach** - The WASPY for Mission Outreach honors
community members who help the community GROW.  Growth can happen inside
the larger OWASP community or outside it in the broader AppSec and
development communities.   Leaders and Members should especially
consider volunteers who pushed the boundaries of the audience and reach
of OWASP to provide new exposure for OWASP’s projects and chapters.  New
leaders and volunteers who help bring more people to your chapter,
project, or actively represent OWASP at non-OWASP events, gatherings,
and activities to build an active OWASP community are ideal candidates
for the Mission Outreach WASPY award.
**Best Innovator** - The WASPY for Innovation is given to a community
member who has contributed to the TECHNICAL advancement of OWASP in the
past year.  This advancement is usually through an [OWASP
Project](:Category:OWASP_Project "wikilink") and can be in the form of
code, an application, or anything that materially makes the AppSec
community better in a unique way.  WASPYs focus on the unsung heros of
the OWASP community who quietly go about making the world a bit better
for their work.  Project Leaders and Community Members should especially
consider nominating new projects, projects that have recently graduated,
and project contributors for this WASPY.

## Rules

**Remember the purpose of these awards is to recognize the UNSUNG HEROS
out there, that are barely recognized for their contributions to the
OWASP Foundation.**

<td><p><strong><em>Best Community Supporter</em></strong> "In 2015, Joaquin took it upon himself to revive the OWASP Phoenix Chapter. He created a meet-up group to gain broader visibility. Since 2015, the meeting attendance has grown from an average of 15 attendees to over 60! Joaquin dedicates a lot of time and effort into scheduling an impressive variety of presentation topics including safe hacking, vulnerability scanner deep dives, hands on web exploitation CTF, video game hacking and more. I learn something new and cool at every event.</p>
<p>More importantly, Joaquin works hard to foster a friendly, inclusive environment. During our hands-on web exploitation session, Joaquin recruited co-works to assist participants with the Security Shephard challenges so no one felt overwhelmed or impossibly stuck. He always takes the time meet and welcome new members. For example, my 17-year-old son attends meetings with me. He looks up to Joaquin as a mentor for a future information security career because Joaquin encourages his learning and offers career guidance.</p>
<p>I highly recommend Joaquin for a WASPY award</p></td>
<td><p>He is a kind, soft spoken person with a passion for sharing information security and helping others!"</p>
<p><strong>2nd Citation:</strong> "He resurrected the Phoenix chapter and has kept it going with great content."</p>
<p><strong>3rd Citation:</strong> "For all he has done to build up the Phoenix OWASP community. Prior to Joaquin taking point the community in Phoenix was dead. Meetings weren't happening on a regular basis. The prior leaders had done a great job but I think they had burnt out. Joaquin started the community back up and got corporate support from his employer to facilitate not only regular meetings but great meetings with great content. He also implemented MeetUp. I'm not a consistent attendee because of my work/life schedule but I always know when the meetings are happening and what the subject matter will be because of Joaquin utilizing MeetUp."</p>
<p><strong>4th Citation:</strong> "Put simply, due to the efforts of Joaquin Fuentes, the Phoenix chapter has risen from the ashes (some pun intended). Before Joaquin took over the chapter there were consistently between 5-10 persons in attendance, Joaquin himself being one of them, and the chapter only met about every 3 months or so. Since Joaquin took over the chapter, we have had fantastic presenters each month, paid for dinners, along with a collaborative, comfortable, and engaging environment to meet in. Even more impressive the attendance has grown to 60+ consistently. Joaquin isn't even done yet! He is more great ideas and plans for the chapter that will undoubtedly contribute to the continued growth and over all quality of this once fallen chapter. When he speaks of where this chapter has come from and his plans for the future, it is undeniable to all that he does so with the passion that a leader must possess to accomplish that which Joaquin has."</p>
<p><strong>5th Citation:</strong> "I am sure someone else will write in with Joaquin's email, but I felt the need to second his name on the list. The events he puts together are top notch, have excellent speakers, always have things to eat, and are generally excellent. I almost never miss them. He is actually so gracious about the entire chapter that I am sure he does not get the credit he deserves... the whole show is put on by just him, I think. Yay Joaquin!"</p>
<p><strong>6th Citation:</strong> "A few years ago, the Phoenix (AZ) OWASP group was basically defunct. As the leader of the Phoenix OWASP group, not only has Joaquin helped to resurrect the group, but we've had great presentations on reverse engineering, secure coding, a hands-on CTF contest with Security Shepherd, etc. Joaquin is a very visible member of the security community being an employee at Early Warning, which not only hosts the OWASP meetings, but also is a sponsor and makes a strong showing at CactusCon every year, the biggest security conference in Arizona.</p>
<p>Our local OWASP group is not strong, going from being non-existent a few years ago to now getting a regular attendance of 40-80 people. I've gotten to know Joaquin through OWASP meetings and other security events in the area I have crossed paths with him, and he is a fine representative and evangelist for the OWASP organization."</p>
<p><strong>7th Citation:</strong> "Joaquin is the Phoenix OWASP Chapter leader and regularly plans amazing talks with great speakers for the Phoenix Community. Frequently, the Phoenix OWASP talks will have over 50 attendees which Joaquin manages without a problem! Joaquin also pushes for candidates he is interviewing to be familiar with OWASP before their interview."</p>
<p><strong>8th Citation:</strong> "Joaquin is the leader for the Phoenix OWASP, and it is clear that through his leadership the Phoenix OWASP thrives. Joaquin organizes all the meetings, and is constantly working with folks to create an excellent sense of community in the Phoenix area."</p>
<p><strong>9th Citation:</strong> "Joaquin has taken the Phoenix OWASP chapter that had not been managed for years and brought it back to life. We consistently see 50+ members coming to our Meetups to talk about AppSec related topics. Joaquin is well connected to the InfoSec groups and has had great success in pulling in new speakers, we have already had a few speakers who are prepping their BlackHat and DefCon talks by giving their presentations to our local chapter. Finally Joaquin does a great job by reaching out to the local colleges and supporting CTF activities to garner interest in pen-testing and the OWASP community. He is a true community supporter and fully deserves a WASPY for his efforts..."</p>
<p><strong>10th Citation:</strong> "Joaquin has been leading the OWASP Phoenix chapter and due to his initiative, has placed Phoenix on the map as a hub for application security. I would like to nominate him because he is always bringing in new and interesting speakers that provide great content. The most recent OWASP chapter meeting had over 60 attendees!"</p>
<p><strong>11th Citation:</strong> "As a leader of Phoenix OWASP chapter, Joaquin strives to organize talks and trainings to make people in the valley learn InfoSec and AppSec from experienced individuals. He has always gone a step ahead to conduct OWASP meetings that are informative and hands on. Right from giving Arizona State University (ASU) students an overview of basic InfoSec and career opportunities to organizing a hands on hacking workshop for people in the community, Joaquin has always demonstrated passion and determination to take Phoenix to a better place in the field of Cyber Security."</p>
<p><strong>12th Citation:</strong> "I've attended and participated in three OWASP meetings lead by Joaquin. They are always well organized, offer a great learning experience and considerably contribute to the community. His continuous interest and dedication to the Phoenix chapter do not go unnoticed and are appreciated by all who attend."</p>
<p><strong>13th Citation:</strong> "Joaquin restarted the OWASP chapter in Phoenix/Scottsdale. Chapter meetings have grown significantly to where there were about 65 attendees at the most recent meeting with hundreds more on the mailing list (I was at the meeting, but I've only heard about the mailing list). As someone who works with him, I know how dedicated he is to the work of IT security and he's been able to attract top-notch speakers for OWASP meetings.'</p>
<p><strong>14th Citation:</strong> "Joaquin had successfully revived the Phoenix OWASP Chapter. Since, the chapter has excelled from zero to filled audience bringing security talent from all around to speak and educate to security professionals on the many facets of security domains.</p>
<p>Additionally, this has provided a great forum to network with the many security professionals around the community and share their knowledge and strengthen the security community.</p>
<p>Joaquin has provided his unselfish time as an OWASP Chapter leader, and has breathed new life into the Chapter."</p>
<p><strong>15th Citation:</strong> "Joaquin does a bang up job of running the Phoenix OWASP chapter. He does a great job of raising awareness and bringing folks from the infosec community into the fold."</p>
<p><strong>16th Citation:</strong> "Joaquin Fuentes has had a big impact in raising attendance at the Phoenix meetings to more than 100 people monthly. The quality has gotten significantly better under his leadership. He has organized many speakers, including recruiting speakers from out of the area that have significantly developed the knowledge base of the community. Joaquin is a pen testing manager at Early Warning and he shares his professional knowledge to help us all become better in the practice of information security."</p>

The chapter has not only grown by over 500% in that time, but female membership has grown from 2 female members to over 70 (the chapter has grown for many reasons, some of which are her promotional efforts). Activities include starting a mentoring program that matches senior AppSec members of the community with juniors or people who are hoping to get into Application Security; attending all sorts of technology meetups (but especially female-centric ones) to talk about OWASP and personally invite them to attend; bringing OWASP products, concepts and resources to the Canadian Government (and is currently attempting to sway policy to be more application security focused as we speak); as well as performing over 40 public speaking engagements that describe OWASP as “Your new BFF” as part of the application security lesson she has taught. She has also begun speaking at conferences semi-regularly, singing OWASP’s praises as part of every presentation. She also forms female groups to attend events together, to make them more accessible, such as her all-female team for the Ottawa iHack CTP and “Learn by Breaking things” event in June 2017 and her all female CTF team for OWASP Ottawa’s first CTF in 2015. Her claim of being an “application security evangelist” certainly seems fitting."</p></td>

In the wake of WannaCry, anti-ransomware guidance has become more pertinent than ever and the project is regularly updated to keep abreast of the latest ransomware adaptations. Chris regularly shares his anti-ransomware knowledge with the security and healthcare communities and is an advocate for organizations conducting mock ransomware incidents. Chris has shared his knowledge of ransomware protections and of pertinent OWASP resources in numerous venues including articles (https://iapp.org/news/a/why-the-wannacry-outbreak-should-be-a-wake-up-call/) and conference presentations at both the local and international level (https://iapp.org/conference/iapp-canada-privacy-symposium/sessions/?id=a191a000000zrqPAAQ). A Spanish version of the guidance is also available. In addition, he has worked to call attention to the need for healthcare facilities to improve the security of their medical device implementations and is responsible for authoring version 1 of the OWASP Secure Medical Device Deployment Standard. The project has really worked to raise awareness of these issues and has been covered by CSO magazine (http://www.csoonline.com/article/3188230/security/how-to-securely-deploy-medical-devices.html) and other news sources. Chris has given interviews on medical device security for the Cloud Security Alliance and others and will be speaking on medical device security at the Defcon BioHacking Village.

I would like to nominate him because he is always bringing in new and interesting speakers that provide great content. The most recent OWASP chapter meeting had over 60 attendees!"</p>
<p><strong>3rd Citation</strong>: "Joaquin Fuentes has had a big impact in raising attendance at the Phoenix meetings to more than 100 people monthly. The quality has gotten significantly better under his leadership. He has organized many speakers, including recruiting speakers from out of the area that have significantly developed the knowledge base of the community. Joaquin is a pen testing manager at Early Warning and he shares his professional knowledge to help us all become better in the practice of information security."</p>
<p><strong>4th Citation</strong>: "My job takes me to many different OWASP Chapters, along with ISSA, CSA, ISACA, etc. The Phoenix OWASP Chapter was DEAD before Joaquin volunteered to lead the Chapter a few years ago. It is now consistently one of the BEST ITSec community gatherings, and I go out of my way to be in Phoenix for their meetings. To put it a different way, at my first Phoenix OWASP meeting there were less than 12 attendees, including myself and the speaker. Last week it was standing room only (75+) *and* there would have been more if Interstate 17 hadn't been closed in both directions at the start of rush-hour. Part of the reason Joaquin deserves this award is that he is EXTREMELY knowledgeable about AppSec and many other aspects of data security and he is ALWAYS friendly and willing to share. His day-job is no picnic, but he finds the time to put together great meetings and do it in a way that everybody has a good time."</p></td>

<td><p><a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/User:Tanyajanca">Tanya Janca</a></p></td>
<td><p><strong><em>Best Mission Outreach</em></strong> "Tanya has been instrumental in outreach in the Ottawa Ontario Canada region building membership and participation in the local OWASP chapter, as well as building bridges with other local organizations (Python user group, Ruby Rails user group, WIA, etc.). Tanya has also been a driver in getting a mentoring program setup via the Ottawa chapter. She has also encouraged participation in local CTF events, presented at local conferences (BSides, etc). Tanya's enthusiasm, support, and interaction is often contagious (in a good way :) ). Lastly, Tanya is a strong advocate or evangelist for OWASP projects, promoting such as appropriate per audience/presentation (including, but not limited to: ZAP, Top 10, SKF)."</p>
<p><strong>2nd Citation:</strong> "Tanya Janca is an excellent ambassador for OWASP. Since her entry into the lead team of the OWASP Ottawa chapter, she has doubled the size of the chapter and developed the chapter into a meeting place for dozens of women interested in Application Security. Tanya Janca is an energetic speaker who held a fantastic presentation at AppSecEU in Belfast. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPTmuaC2lOI She was subsequently invited to the Swiss Cyberstorm Conference where her addition to the rooster was explained in an admiring blogpost https://swisscyberstorm.com/2017/05/23/Introducing_Tany_Janca.html Tanya Janca has the ability to talk security to techies and management alike. She is pushing for the adoption of OWASP practices and project by the government of Canada her employer. Having been nominated for the Government of Canada’s CIO Award for “Excellent in Security” in 2016 she refused to move into the private sector, but continues to support the security community inside the public sector, where her excellent know-how is very important."</p>
<p><strong>3rd Citation:</strong> "Tanya Janca has been performing “outreach” and “recruitment of women” as her main chapter leader responsibilities for the Ottawa chapter since 2015. The chapter has not only grown by over 500% in that time, but female membership has grown from 2 female members to over 70 (the chapter has grown for many reasons, some of which are her promotional efforts). Activities include starting a mentoring program that matches senior AppSec members of the community with juniors or people who are hoping to get into Application Security; attending all sorts of technology meetups (but especially female-centric ones) to talk about OWASP and personally invite them to attend; bringing OWASP products, concepts and resources to the Canadian Government (and is currently attempting to sway policy to be more application security focused as we speak); as well as performing over 40 public speaking engagements that describe OWASP as “Your new BFF” as part of the application security lesson she has taught. She has also begun speaking at conferences semi-regularly, singing OWASP’s praises as part of every presentation. She also forms female groups to attend events together, to make them more accessible, such as her all-female team for the Ottawa iHack CTP and “Learn by Breaking things” event in June 2017 and her all female CTF team for OWASP Ottawa’s first CTF in 2015. Her claim of being an “application security evangelist” certainly seems fitting."</p></td>

He has likely done more then anyone else working with OWASP to bring together, motivate, and get individuals to contribute to OWASP.

You might have encountered them talking at seminars, promoting their project and OWASP, or different companies where they teach development teams how to integrate the OWASP core principles in their workflow using their project. Not only professional development teams but also students of security can only be amazed at the sheer knowledge they gathered and contribute to the global OWASP community trough open source. The sheer effort they put in this project teaches, guides, structures and shows by example how to test and write secure applications by design. There is no other software out there that does this.

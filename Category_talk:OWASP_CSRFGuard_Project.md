How does this affect certain standard browser navigation features?
Specifically, does this break the "Back," "Forward," and
"Reload/Refresh" buttons?

Also, I would assume that re-authentication would be necessary for
bookmarked pages. Does it handle these well, or does it choke on an
invalid (not blank) request token?

Bot-generated attacks targeting web application infrastructure are
increasing in both volume and scope. Bots are becoming more
sophisticated, leveraging headless browser technologies and use
different evasion techniques such as dynamically changing IP addresses.

In this presentation we will review the challenges associated with IP
agnostic detection of bot generated attacks, the complexity involved in
distinguishing the good bots from the bad and the actions application
developers can take for better thwarting of such attacks.

As IoT devices are increasingly embedded in our every day lives,
vulnerabilities have real impact on our digital and physical security.

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), also known as Bluetooth Smart, is part of
Bluetooth 4. Today Bluetooth is the most popular protocol used for
interfacing IoT and smart devices, wearables and medical equipment. Like
most rising technologies, security is often left out.

In this lecture we will demonstrate how to perform penetration-testing
for applications communicating with connected-devices over BLE. What
equipment, libraries and projects can be used.

''' 19:15 – Coffee break '''

''' 19:30 – Should I Trust My Vendor? *'
*' Yaniv Simsolo, CTO, Palantir Security '''
Modern systems and business models mandate different approaches to
security. Sometimes, the business objectives of the vendor override the
security objectives that we, the security community, think the product
should have. When approaching a complex system design, numerous
challenges arise when considering the trust we put on vendors’ hands and
vendors’ responsibilities. Similar security challenges exist on the
other scale: considering the maturity (or lack thereof) of small scale
IoT products.

Does the aim sanctify the means?

In certain cases, either mal-coding or business practices result in a
very poor security of a product or a service. This can get to extreme
cases were the vendor outright attacks its own customers. Such was the
case for example when I purchased a brand new laptop from a known
manufacturer, and was attacked with viruses and malicious business
practices software. Indeed, certain vendors are worse than others.

In the presentation we will explore notable examples of vendors abusing
their customers’ trust and review the (few) mitigation alternatives we
may incorporate in our products and systems.

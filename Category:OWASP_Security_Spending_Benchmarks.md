## NEXT REPORT CURRENTLY COLLECTING RESPONSES - AIMING FOR Q2 DELIVERY

## Q2 Report Published - Focus on Cloud Computing

The Q2 report of the OWASP Security Spending Benchmarks Project is now
available. It can be found at the following link:

[PDF
Download](http://www.owasp.org/images/f/f0/OWASP_SSB_Q2_Project_Report.pdf)

There are a number of key findings in the Q2 09 study:

  - Software-as-a-Service is in much greater use than
    Infrastructure-as-a-Service or Platform-as-a-Service. Over half of
    respondents make moderate or significant use of SaaS. Less than a
    quarter of all respondents make any use of either IaaS or PaaS.

<!-- end list -->

  - Security spending does not change significantly as a result of cloud
    computing. Respondents did not report significant spending changes
    in the areas of network security, third party security reviews,
    security personnel, or identity management.

<!-- end list -->

  - Organizations are not doing their homework when it comes to cloud
    security. When engaging a cloud partner, only half of organizations
    inquire about common security-related issues, and only a third
    require documentation of security measures in place.

<!-- end list -->

  - The risk of an undetected data breach is the greatest concern with
    using cloud computing, closely followed by the risk of a public data
    breach.

<!-- end list -->

  - Compliance and standards requirements related to cloud computing are
    not well understood. Respondents report having the greatest
    understanding of PCI requirements relating to cloud computing and
    the least understanding of HIPAA cloud requirements.

## Security Spending Benchmarks Project Report March 2009

The Q1 2009 report of the OWASP Security Spending Benchmarks Project is
now available. It can be found at the following link:

[PDF
Download](http://www.owasp.org/images/b/b2/OWASP_SSB_Project_Report_March_2009.pdf).

There are a number of key findings in the Q1 09 study:

  - Organizations that have suffered a public data breach spend more on
    security in the development process than those that have not.

<!-- end list -->

  - Web application security spending is expected to either stay flat or
    increase in nearly two thirds of companies.

<!-- end list -->

  - Half of respondents consider security experience important when
    hiring developers, and a majority provide their developers with
    security training. 38% have a third party firm conduct a security
    review of outsourced code.

<!-- end list -->

  - At least 61% of respondents perform an independent third party
    security review before deploying a Web application while 17% do not
    (the remainder do not know or do so when requested by customers).

<!-- end list -->

  - Just under half of the surveyed organizations have Web application
    firewalls deployed for at least some of their Web applications.

## Raw Data

Transparency is a key principle of the OWASP SSB Project. For this
reason all raw survey results are made available to the community. We
welcome additional commentary and interpretations on the survey data.
The raw survey data can be found
[here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/sr_detail.aspx?sm=6RXm2J2aqar1MT7JlandR0MYzVFmx25FwQ9trvJH1JG4GcuRCMp3TAkaCJyNCQYrtI1Ny025AnORe0Y3lU%2bj7w%3d%3d).

## Inquiries

Please contact the project leader Boaz Gelbord (bgelbord at wgen dot
net) if you have questions about the project or you would like to
inquire about contributing to the project.

## About the Security Spending Benchmarks Project

The Security Spending Benchmarks Project seeks to produce guidance and
an industry accepted benchmark for justifying overall Web application
security spending. We want to quantify how many dollars and human
resources should be allocated towards the software development
life-cycle, security training, security software/tools, independent
third-party reviews, Web application firewalls, etc. This project is
motivated by the fact that:

  - There are few, if any, industry standard benchmarks for executive
    management to consider when deciding what is a reasonable amount of
    resources to spend on Web application security in or out of the
    software development processes.
  - Spending on security helps mitigate risks whose potential costs are
    often difficult to quantify, thereby making justifying and obtaining
    security budgets difficult.
  - Many business initiatives require organizations to take “reasonable
    measures” and “adhere to best practices” for developing, delivering,
    and/or hosting secure Web application, but there is no industry
    consensus or data repositories on how this translates into monetary
    terms.
  - Smaller organizations outside of highly regulated industries
    purchase and deploy Web applications with no realistic ability to
    evaluate their security program.
  - Producing a less secure Web application may be less expensive than
    producing a more secure version of the same software. Organization
    that have invested development resources into software security may
    not be able to charge a premium for this investment because there is
    no reference point for the investment.

The survey was formulated with the help of our project partners to
address the following questions and many others:

  - What percentage of a Web application development groups headcount is
    dedicated towards security?
  - How much budget is allocated towards Web application security as a
    percentage of software development and overall operational IT
    security costs?
  - Where do Web application security budget come from?
  - How much budget is allocated towards security education?

## Data Collection & Distribution

We utilize the SurveyMonkey system to host surveys conducted for the
OWASP SSB Project. We do not collect any publicly identifiable
information including names, addresses, employer, email addresses, etc.
from the respondents. While we expect a limited number of respondents
trying to intentionally skew the results, we take precautions to limit
the potential while not creating unnecessary overhead. We control survey
access via username/password, as well as through a trusted network of
contacts. All information collected is made available through Survey
Monkey.

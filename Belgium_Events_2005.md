### Meeting Notes second OWASP Belgium Chapter meeting (Leuven, 28-Sep-2005)

On 28th of September 2005 we had our second OWASP Belgium Chapter
meeting. We had nearly 50 people coming to the meeting\!
**WHEN**
Wednesday 28th of September 2005, 18h00 - 21h00 at Ubizen in Leuven.
**PROGRAM**
18h00 - 18h15: Welcome & get a drink
18h15 - 18h45: Sebastien Deleersnyder, Ascure
        **[OWASP & OWASP
Membership](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Image:OWASP_Belgium_Chapter_Meeting_-_Leuven_-_28_Sep_2005_-_1_OWASP_and_OWASP_Membership.ppt)**
18h45 - 19h30: Emmanuel Bergmans, I-logs
        **[Securing Web Applications with
ModSecurity](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Image:OWASP_Belgium_Chapter_Meeting_-_Leuven_-_28_Sep_2005_-_2_Securing_Web_Applications_with_ModSecurity.ppt)**
Emmanuel gave an interesting introduction on ModSecurity.
The presentation is included as attachment and contains a lot of great
pointers and SWOT analysis.
Conclusions were:
ModSecurity can be particularly useful in an ISP environment
Increased effort is necessary to synchronize multiple ModSecurity
configurations in a Webfarm
19h30 - 20h45:
OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities: Panel Discussion
        **[The presentation is included with an introduction of the
TOP 10.](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Image:OWASP_Belgium_Chapter_Meeting_-_Leuven_-_28_Sep_2005_-_3_OWASP_Top_10_-_Panel.ppt)**
Then we had a lively panel Discussion with:
\* Erwin Geirnaert, Security Innovation
\* Dirk Dussart, Belgian Post
\* Eric Devolder, Mastercard
\* Herman Stevens, Ubizen
\* Frank Piessens, KU Leuven

We handled questions about the Top 10:
\* Is the OWASP Top 10 still necessary?
\* Are we talking vulnerabilities, solutions or threats?
\* Can we base our best practices / standards on the Top 10?
\* How to test your web site security on the Top 10?
\* …
The overall discussion was interesting, and at times diverted to an
overall application security discussion.
Some of the remarkable opinions covered:
Can / or should the OWASP Top 10 form the basis for a certification
scheme
If it is used as an awareness tool, can we promote it with an OWASP
magazine?
The OWASP Top 10 is too vague
A bigger exhaustive list is needed with a clear classification and
taxonomy
It should be based on threat modelling.
One of the more pertinent questions: how did the original authors come
to the Top 10?

### Meeting Notes First OWASP Belgium Chapter Meeting (Gent, 26-May-2005)

On 26th of May 2005 we held the first OWASP Belgium Chapter meeting\!
It was a big success: we had nearly 40 people attending, despite the
Belgium-unlike hot weather.

**PROGRAM**
17h30 - 18h00: Welcome & get a drink
18h00 - 18h45: Sebastien Deleersnyder, Ascure
        **[OWASP
Introduction](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Image:First_OWASP_Belgium_Chapter_Meeting_-_Gent_-_26_May_2005_-_I_OWASP_Introduction.ppt)**
19h00 - 19h45: Erwin Geirnaert, Security Innovation
        **[How to Break Web Application
Security](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Image:First_OWASP_Belgium_Chapter_Meeting_-_Gent_-_26_May_2005_-_II_How_to_Break_Web_Application_Security.ppt)**
20h00 - 20h45: professor Frank Piessens, KU Leuven
        **[How to Build Secure Web
Applications](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Image:First_OWASP_Belgium_Chapter_Meeting_-_Gent_-_26_May_2005_-_III_How_to_Build_Secure_Web_Applications.ppt)**
We had some interesting discussions with Frank on the position of
security controls: within the code or within the supporting
infrastructure?
Another idea is also to look for a top 10 solutions for Web Applications
and have some guidance system when selecting countermeasures.

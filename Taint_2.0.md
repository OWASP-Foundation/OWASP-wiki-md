**Taint 2.0** - Commercial static analysis tools for detecting security
flaws in software use a technique called Taint Analysis. However,
traditional taint analysis has limitations that prevent it from
accurately detecting vulnerabilities in today's complex applications. We
explore the challenges of current taint analysis approaches, and explain
how an exciting new technology called String Analysis answers these
challenges. We show how String Analysis produces more accurate results
while eliminating the need to provide user configuration of sanitizers.

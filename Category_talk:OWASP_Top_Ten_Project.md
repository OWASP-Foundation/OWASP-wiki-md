Is there a 2006 version, or a 2007 in the works?

`Stay tuned, a new version will be out in early 2007.`

Am I the only one that finds the fact that this list is a wiki funny?
Also, what's with all the mixed content errors?

Hi there, I came here to ask this question but found it already there,
and wondering if there is someone who can answer this question. The
question is: Is there a 2006 version?

If I may develop the question, and ask: I suppose there is a Top-10 list
for the year 2005. Has it been done? And if yes it has, then where is
it?

Thanks,

## Claim relating to the Top Ten

In the release announcement for the Lift framework, version 2.1
(http://liftweb.net/21_ga) there is a claim:

"Secure by default... Lift apps are resistant to the OWASP top 10
vulnerabilities including XSS, XSRF, and parameter tampering"

I believe the claim is made in good faith. I was just wondering if
something like this merited a mention somewhere on this page.

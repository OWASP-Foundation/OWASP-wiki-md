**Notes**

All-committee-chair call was held.  Membership-relevant items that came
out of that include:

  - The Industry Committee has had folks express a desire for an
    NDA-like environment where members could discuss issues within
    OWASP but not have the results of those discussions broadcast. 
    This may be of value, but would need to be reconciled with OWASP's
    requirement for Openness.
  - The Conference Committee is in the process of creating a model for
    organizations to sign up for a package of sponsorships for
    conferences throughout the year.  We may be able to link Membership
    with this to accomplish our goal of allowing organizations who want
    to give more than that $5k USD supporter fee to do so.
  - There is talk of creating student chapters and people participating
    in those chapters would need some sort of membership.  This needs to
    be deconflicted with University Supporters and other educational
    efforts coming out of OWASP

Helen spoke with OWASP chatpers around the world:

  - Based on Helen's research talking to parties interested in
    OWASP around the world, it appears that a $20 Individual Membership
    fee and a $2000 Organizational Supporter fee is what the market will
    bear in non-US and non-Western Europe economies (note: Singapore
    folks appear to be all right with the existing fees of $50 and $5000
    respectively).
  - However we still need to address the issue of incentives to become a
    Member/Supporter because the altruistic model promoted to US/Wester
    European folks does not necessarily have a cultural analog in other
    parts of the world.
  - "Certificates of participation" might be a potential benefit
  - We could also partner with other developer and security
    organizations to try and drive awareness of OWASP membership and
    participation
  - We need to be aware that having foreign organizations pay
    OWASP might be challenging.  Using a personal account (specifically
    a credit card account) as an intermediary might be an option in some
    cases.  Tax-free contributions to nonprofits are less common in
    other parts of the world.  For example in China most organizations
    are either State-owned or private - there is less of a concept of
    non-profits

Regional Supporters

  - We made a "one-off" deal with a pseudo-government agency in Malaysia
    to make them an Organizational Supporter for $2k USD. They may be
    able to additionally donate space, etc.
  - We will try to test the waters with this approach and see how it
    progresses
  - Ofer Maor provided a draft model for expanding Regional Supporters
    and that will be reviewed and discussed at the next meeting

The list of Organizational and Educational Supporters on the
OWASP Membership page is getting a bit crowded.

  - Perhaps create a separate page that is searchable?
  - Perhaps move to a model with different levels of support -
    organizations that gave money versus those that provide other
    support such as meeting space, etc.

Ongoing hard question: How does OWASP Membership best provide value to
"Industry" members versus "Vendor" members

  - OWASP NDA-like relationship (as mentioned above)
  - Need to have more discussions with Industry folks - likely brokered
    by the Industry Committee

Plan for using administrative support for OWASP Membership Committee

  - Use same person who is providing support for NY/NJ - will need to
    provide clear guidance to deconflict and create an actual job
    description before she starts
  - Main thrust - provide consistent "touches" with Organizational
    Supporters to get feedback from them and maintain more ongoing
    relationship

Budget:

  - Administrative support
  - Marketing ?

For next meeting:

  - Distill notes from Helen's efforts as well as Ofer's draft Regional
    Supporter plan

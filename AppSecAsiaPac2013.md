### Abusing, Exploiting and Pwning with Firefox Add-ons

**Ajin Abraham** [(Download the
Presentation)](https://docs.google.com/a/owasp.org/file/d/0B5Z9zE0hx0LNZWI0UC1MbjZCSEE/edit)

The talk is about abusing and exploiting Firefox add-on Security model
and explains how JavaScript functions, XPCOM and XPConnect interfaces,
technologies like CORS and WebSocket, Session storing and full privilege
execution can be abused by a hacker for malicious purposes. The widely
popular browser add-ons can be targeted by hackers to implement new
malicious attack vectors resulting in confidential data theft and full
system compromise. This paper is supported by proof of concept add-ons
which abuse and exploits the add-on coding in Firefox 17, the release
which Mozilla boasts to have a more secure architecture against
malicious plugins and add-ons. The proof of concept includes the
implementation of a Local keylogger, a Remote keylogger, stealing Linux
password files, spawning a Reverse Shell, stealing the authenticated
Firefox session data, and Remote DDoS attack. All of these attack
vectors are fully undetectable against anti-virus solutions and can
bypass protection mechanisms.

### A Call for Drastic Action: A Survey of Web Application Firewalls

**Jaeson Yoo** [(Download the
Presentation)](https://owasp.org/images/2/2b/APAC13_Jaeson_Yoo.pdf)

Web application firewalls (WAFs) have become an unquestioned necessity
in the modern world.

According to Gartner, 75% of all IT threats target the web application
layer. The Ponemon Institute announced earlier this year that 93% of
organizations hacked in the past two years were breached via insecure
web applications. These are astounding figures, illustrating the
vulnerability of web servers, through which we conduct so much of our
daily business, as well as the significance of WAFs in addressing this
vulnerability.

So why have so many businesses been reluctant to install WAFs? After
all, they were designed specifically to deal with web application
attacks. WAFs have been proven to block web attacks, and in some cases,
provide effective countermeasures against them.

By taking a closer look at first- and second-generation web application
firewalls, it seems to me that we can begin to find answers to this
question. Until now, WAFs have been undermined by modified attacks,
false positives, and an inordinate amount of burden to those who are
entrusted to manage them.

First generation WAFs were based on a pattern-matching scheme, and
brought about the advent of the Black List. The IT security
administration would add a known attack pattern, and compile similar
patterns to form the Black List. In so doing, the first-generation WAF
could compare web traffic to its updated patterns, analyzing them at the
application level. This list was static, meaning that there was no
detection system put into place for new or modified attacks against the
web application layer.

The first generation WAFs were not particular successful in the IT
security market. Perhaps most companies wanted to stick with their
Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems, ignoring the fact that these
components did painfully little for the OSI Layer 7, or the web
application layer. Perhaps companies wanted to actualize a
return-on-investment on their legacy purchases.

But this does not mean that the first generation WAFs themselves didn’t
have something to do with their disappointing sales. First, the heavy
workload was a drawback. Administrators constantly had to update known
attack patterns on the black list. This meant many hours for the WAF
administration team, assuming that the end-user even had such a team.
More often, it meant having to hire more people, an especially
unattractive prospect for smaller, cash-strapped organizations. In other
words, not only did you have to invest in WAFs, you also had to invest
in an expensive, highly-trained IT staff to run them.

If first-generation WAFs provided top-notch security, perhaps the
additional investments could have been digested. But WAFs did not
protect against new or modified attacks. They also produced a
significant number of false positives. Most significantly, all this work
for marginal security also resulted in poor performance. If you put more
than 3,000 signature-based rules, system performance begins to slow.
More than 5,000 signatures means that you may have to delete some old
rules, just to make rooms for new ones.

In light of these limitations, WAF providers came up with a
second-generation solution to address some of these problems.
Second-generation WAFs came with a white list, or a list that includes
all permissible traffic. By using the white list along with the black
list, these updated WAFs were supposed to make things easier for the WAF
administrator, since the white list would essentially serve as an
automated security policy.

Unfortunately, second-generation WAFs did little to alleviate manpower
requirements. In fact, these updated WAFs resulted in a heavier workload
for the administrator. The white list would take up to two weeks to
implement. Also, in spite of the fact that these automated security
policies were supposed to make things easier for the administrator,
second-generation WAFs still needed manual configuration. All of this
meant more work, not less.

Again, if all this meant greater web security, perhaps all of these
problems could have been overlooked. But this wasn’t the case. It was
still a pattern-matching solution, meaning that it was vulnerable to
unknown or modified attacks. It still produced false positives at a
significant rate. And with the white list, it now worsened the system
performance problem.

WAFs were and are definitely necessary. But these first- and
second-generation solutions were coming up significantly short. More
importantly, hackers were becoming increasingly sophisticated with every
new day. So what was needed?

A whole new breed of WAF, an intelligent WAF, based on an entirely new
concept, is needed. This new breed should be capable of analyzing web
traffic, and detect attacks by analyzing and classifying their modus
operandi. After detecting attacks, WAFs needed to apply appropriate
countermeasures to block the threat. And finally, for practically
purposes (especially for smaller companies that can’t hire a whole
brigade of security administrators), WAFs needed to do all this without
continual administrative involvement. In other words, a new solution was
needed to provide much better security, while lessening the
administrative burden for customers.

### Design Secure Web Applications

**Ashish Rao** [(Download the
Presentation)](https://www.owasp.org/images/f/f4/APAC13_Ashish_Rao.pdf)

[Checklist for securing web application
design](https://www.owasp.org/images/f/f7/Checklist_For_Design.pdf)

We are all aware of “secure coding” and practice it to great extent
while developing applications. But do we give equal attention to –
“Secure Design”? Most of us would probably say, NO. Design level flaws
are lesser known concepts but their presence is a very big risk to the
applications. Such flaws are hard to find in static or dynamic
application scans and instead require deep understanding of application
architecture and layout to uncover them manually. With increasing
business needs the complexities in application design and architecture
are also increasing. There is a rise in the use of custom design
techniques and diverse technologies in the applications today. But in
the midst of all this, have we ever thought about design level security?

Will only secure coding practices help to keep a multi-tiered custom
designed application safe?

If that question gets you thinking this presentation will help fetch you
an answer for it.

This presentation focuses on highlighting some important secure design
principles that developers and architects must adapt to build a secure
application design. With the help of some design flaws we will see the
areas of design that are exposed to security risks and what measures can
be taken to avoid them in our design.

### Dissecting Smart Meters

**Justin Searle** [(Download the
Presentation)](https://owasp.org/images/2/2a/APAC13_Justin_Searle_-_Dissecting_Smart_Meters_v4.pdf)

The Smart Grid brings greater benefits for electric utilities and
customer alike, however these benefits come at a cost from a security
perspective. This presentation will explore the architecture of most
Smart Meters, the protocols they use, a breakdown of their embedded
components, and the functionality their headend servers contain. We'll
explain the methodologies we've developed to perform penetration testing
these AMI systems, enumerate the types of vulnerabilities we commonly
find, and discuss the solutions we recommend to Smart Meter vendors. We
will even demonstrate at least one of the attacks we commonly perform in
our penetration tests. This will be done without the FUD and over-hyped
framing that we usually find in the media and other Smart Grid
presentations.

### The Droid Exploitation Saga

**Aditya Gupta & Subho Halder** [(Download the
Presentation)](https://drive.google.com/a/owasp.org/?tab=mo#folders/0B5Z9zE0hx0LNZmgtazBya0dFMnc)

In this talk, we will be discussing about the recent trends in Android
Security Exploitation, as well as we will be carrying out all the
possible attacks using a framework which we've designed called as
Android Framework for Exploitation.

We will show how easy it could get to break into any Android Device,
either using any exploit, or creating a malware using AFE. Also, in case
the malware gets detected by any of the anti malwares, you 'll have the
option to make it Fully Undetectable again and again, using the
framework.

The things you would be able to steal with the help of AFE-created
malwares, aren't limited to Contacts, Call Logs or Text messages, but
you could also steal the application specific information (contained
within the database files or saved using Content Providers).

We will be covering each topic with live demonstrations and will also
discuss the case studies of vulnerabilities in some of the most popular
android applications.

### Growing sophistication of DDoS attacks

**John Ellis** [(Download the
Presentation)](https://owasp.org/images/6/68/APAC13_John_Ellis.pdf)

2012 saw the unprecedented growth in DDoS attacks, not only in volume
but also in sophistication.

Gone are the days where DDoS attacks were the simple cheap and nasty,
simplistic syn floods. Now they have evolved into a powerful cyber
weapon, a weapon of choice for: cyber extortion, aiding cyber criminals
in their fraud activities, and hacktivists in pushing their cause.

Join John Ellis as he takes a deep dive into the growing sophistication
of DDoS attack and examines:latest tools like 'itsoknoproblembro'the
migration from the botnet to the Virtual Private Systems (VPS) as the
attack platform of choice evolving C2 architecture the use of
multi-vector attacks and the increasing attacks against and over SSL
common approaches to defending against these attacks, whats worked and
what hasn't what organisations should be thinking about next; and ideas
on how to build a protect and perform strategy along with the message to
senior management to secure funding.

### Hacking Authentication Checks in Web Applications

**Siddharth Anbalahan** [(Download the
Presentation)](https://www.owasp.org/images/c/c2/APAC13_Siddharth_Anabalahan.pdf)

Authentication is one of the most coveted and targeted features for
security attacks. Despite its importance and sensitivity we still fail
to see robust implementations of this control in our applications.
Developers just don’t seem to get it right and security researchers just
cannot stop identifying flaws in them. In this talk we will look at 4
insecure authentication control implementation in web applications that
will leave you astounded and make you understand why most of the
applications will be prone to these flaws.

### HTML 5

**Han-Ik Joo** [(Download the
Presentation)](https://www.owasp.org/images/6/6c/APAC13_JooHanik.pdf)

HTML5 unlike the predecessors HTML that was impossible to implement
features is the next generation standard language. However,
vulnerability also is extended, and the fact that it is now possible to
bypass existing countermeasures for Web-based security threats. In this
talk, We will handle Demonstrations and the presentation of the security
threats that can occur in the browser with the newly added features in
HTML5. This talk include the following information as below:

  - CSRF Using XHR Level2
  - XSS using Newly added tag in HTML5
  - Web Storage using information extraction
  - WebSQL Information extraction using JavaScript
  - Web Worker Injection

### Invisibility Purge – Unmasking the Dormant Events of Invisible Web Controls – Advanced Hacking Methods for Asp.Net, Mono and RIA

**Shay Chen** [(Download the
Presentation)](https://owasp.org/images/6/6d/APAC13_ShayChen.pdf)

Web Controls have become common in many popular platforms, enhancing the
software lifecycle by speeding up development, and enabling developers
to reuse custom content.

In platforms such as ASP.Net and Mono, the implementations of Web
controls are packed with features that can enhance the security of
applications, usually with minimum effort.

There are many ways to restrict the access to web controls, including
privilege validation, deletion from pages that were duplicated for low
privileged users, disabling controls, or even by making them invisible
to anyone but users with pre-defined roles.

However, the event activation mechanism can also be a double-edged
sword.

Invisibility, by definition, is in the eyes of the observer.

An object might be invisible to some eyes, while still being visible to
instruments that were designed to locate it.

A new research reveals several methods that attackers can harness to
unmask, enumerate and activate events of hidden web controls, even in
popular platforms such as ASP.Net and Mono.

The slightest mistake or the right conditions can make this development
model a fertile ground for attacks, enabling the attacker to completely
ignore the security features of controls, and gain access to restricted
and dormant server side events.

Locating invisible controls, Unmasking hidden events and activating them
in-spite of various default and custom security measures – once only in
theory, and now a step by step methodology that could be performed
manually, or using designated tools.

This presentation will demonstrate several methods that can be used to
locate invisible web controls, unmask secret events and activate dormant
code. It will also discuss designated modules which are embedded into
the upcoming release of the Diviner extension, an extension of the OWASP
ZAP proxy project.

### Missile of Cyber-terrorism, the reality of APT and Countermeasures

**Security Expert, Growing** [(Download the
Presentation)](https://owasp.org/images/9/9f/APAC13_Ihn-Hyuk._Song.pdf)

APT’s attack is represented intelligented and sophisticated Hacking. As
a result APT can be used to disturb the tackets. Here, this paper
proposed to understand the reality of APT. In other words, APT’s
definitions, properties, and Life-Cycle. Depending on derived
properties, Security defense strategy is suggested differently.

### Open Source Metasploit - The Elixir of Network Security

**Harish Chowdhary and Shubham Mittal**

<span style="color:red"> Talk Cancelled </span>

Today every organization intensely relies on the communication. Every
part of an organization ought to operate closely & ought to be
interconnected for the benefit of the organization. The term
interconnected & communication signifies one of the most vital a part of
an organization primarily of an IT organization is the Computer NETWORK.
Network is the backbone of an IT organizations Network security is a
crucial concern for enterprises, government agencies, and organizations
of all sizes. Today’s advanced threats demand an organized approach to
network security. Information within a network has same importance like
blood in our veins. But the increasing incidence of the network breaches
leading to the critical information loss, finally loss of business &
credibility, clearly indicates that computers networks are not secured
as they seem. Therefore they must be tested for their security. The aim
of this paper is to present the most effective open-source Framework for
network security testing-METASPLOIT. This paper will provide the focused
views on.

What is Metaspliot, how to use Metasploit for Penetration testing & its
various advantages, how to customize you pen test. It will additionally
also put lights on, how to find the intrusion in the network &
mitigation techniques to keep away from the cyber assaults. Whole, the
objective of this paper is to provide a detailed understanding of what
is Metasploit and how to utilize it as a security professional.

### Putting Security within the SDLC via Application Threat Modeling

**Tony UV** [(Download the
Presentation)](https://owasp.org/images/0/0b/APAC13_TonyUV.pdf)

As delusions of effective risk management for application environments
continue to spread, companies continue to bleed large amounts of
security spending without truly knowing if the amount is warranted,
effective, or even elevating security at all. In parallel, hybrid,
thought provoking security strategies are moving beyond conceptual ideas
to practical applications within ripe environments. Application Threat
Modeling is one of those areas where, beyond the hype, provides
practical and sensible security strategy that leverages already existing
security efforts for an improved threat model of what is lurking in the
shadows.

This presentation seeks to walk though practical applications and
exercises associated with application threat modeling. Integration to
multi-security focused disciplines will be included, such as dynamic
analysis, static analysis, incident monitoring, vulnerability
management, social engineering, penetration testing, and more.

The objective of the presentation is to illustrate the efficiency and
effectiveness of application threat modeling in properly integrating and
leveraging security information in order to evolve beyond a broken risk
analysis model for application security today. The PASTA (Process for
Attack Simulation & Threat Analysis) methodology will be introduced as
part of this talk.

The target audience will encompass motley of both IS and IT
professional, ideally providing a cross section of developers, project
managers, system administrators, quality assurance engineers, security
analysts, pen testers, network engineers, security risk analysts, and
even compliance professionals. Due to the level of depth to be covered
in the presentation which will go over Data Flow Diagramming,
Application Decomposition exercises, correlation to existing frameworks
such as Building Security-In Maturity Modeling, Software Assurance
Maturity Modeling, and more.

### Securing data with a Data Encryption Infrastructure

**Arshad Noor** [(Download the
Presentation)](https://owasp.org/images/0/04/APAC13_Arshad_Noor.pdf)

As companies are challenged to keep up with an increasing number of
data-security regulations worldwide, encryption of sensitive data has
become the universal ""safe-harbor"", the last bastion of defense
against unauthorized disclosure of data, mandated or highly recommended
in every regulation.

While the protection of structured data-elements such as Credit Card
Numbers, Bank Account numbers, etc., is addressed by applications on a
case-by-case basis, we are entering an era where unstructured sensitive
data are becoming equally attractive targets. Military documents,
medical data, blueprints of new products, financial and legal documents,
etc. are just as valuable as credit card numbers to attackers depending
on their motiviation and backers.

While it is feasible for companies to address the protection of such
documents on a case-by-case basis, it is far more effective to deploy a
ubiquitous network service that addresses all of the following
requirements:

  - Provide a single point/protocol for commuication to the service
    (much like DNS or DHCP);
  - Is accessible to any platform or programming environment;
  - Provides automated scheduling of cryptographic operations
    (synchronous and asynchronous);
  - Provides automated key-management (generation, escrow, recovery,
    etc.);
  - Auto-scales cryptographic capability to address peaks/valleys of
    processing loads;
  - Integrates with existing Identity and Access Management (IAM)
    infrastructure;
  - Integrates with existing public/private Cloud services;
  - Provides load-balancing and is highly-available; and
  - Meets regulatory requirements of any data-security regulation
    anywhere.

While sounding more like a pipe-dream, this paper presents a case-study
of a real-world implementation of such a network service to protect
structured and unstructured content worth hundreds of millions of
dollars, for one of the largest e-commerce companies in the world.

The Regulatory Compliant Cloud Computing (RC3) - a web-application
architecture for secure cloud-computing - was presented at OWASP AppSec
APAC 2012 in Sydney by this author, where it was fairly well received
(to the best of my knowledge). RC3 is gaining attention worldwide, with
IBM having translated the paper into Chinese, Portuguese and Russian for
the BRIC markets on its developerWorks web-site (http://ibm.co/rc3dw),
and the paper presented at various other conferences around the world
(after AppSec APAC 2012).

This paper continues the discussion to present, for the first time, a
real-world RC3 implementation, and discusses how the experience can be
leveraged by others to address data-protection requirements. It will
include details of the architecture, technology components (FOSS), and
performance data to support the tenets described in the original RC3
paper from 2012.

### Security Challenges of Hybrid Mobile Applications

**Mikko Saario** [(Download the
Presentation)](https://owasp.org/images/2/29/APAC13_Mikko_Saario.pdf)

Mobile application development leveraging a hybrid technology stack is
an accelerated way to bring new apps to market reusing existing
competencies. Hybrid technology essentially refers to using several
different coding languages instead of just the ""native"" one - whatever
it may be in each case. Often existing code and services are reused to
avoid expensive development for each distinctive platform. This way the
‘desktop web’ and the ‘mobile web’ are converging quickly - code can
be shared and reused more and more. The focus technologies in this
presentation are Windows Phone 8 and the Qt framework. Mikko will take a
look into what kind of fundamental security mechanisms or threats do or
do not exist in the two platforms to protect the user and the
application from attacks when mixing several technology stacks. The
expanding availability of development technologies opens up new attack
surface, often with old attacks, to mobile applications: For instance,
Windows Phone 8 introduced the possibility to implement applications in
C++ in addition to the existing C\#/Silverlight + web technologies. Are
buffer overflows back? Qt is built on top of C++ and implements for
instance the WebKit and QtQuick (QML with inline JavaScript)
technologies for quickly developing cross-platform applications. The
combination of these multiple stacks provide ample attack surface
against mobile applications.

The presentation will cover security pitfalls when mixing native code
and JavaScript in the Qt/QML stack, Qt-specific XSS and other injection
issues, deploying code in webviews in both platforms - and the lack of
common user security indicators in them, how malicious code can identify
native methods exposed to a hybrid environment, how the same origin
policy and code sandboxing differ from the typical desktop browser, how
to leak your geolocation in Windows Phone, surprising differences in
using a headless browser vs. IE Mobile in the older Windows Phone 7.5
and much more. Using a live demo application I will walk through several
hybrid platform issues and threats in Windows Phone 8.

During the testing vulnerabilities were discovered in both the WP8 and
Qt platforms and these will be demoed in cases where the vendor has
either fixed the issue or the information is otherwise already public.

### Using the Wisdom of the Crowd to Enhance Application Security

**Moshe Lerner** [(Download the
Presentation)](https://owasp.org/images/6/69/APAC13_Moshe_Lerner.pdf)

Security-oriented source code analysis tools detect vulnerabilities only
for well-defined hacks and tend to return many results which are hard to
remediate. Two problems result: One, how can we overcome the lack of
coverage? And two, how can we improve the ability to fix?

These problems are all the more pressing considering today’s short
development cycles through Agile methodologies, the ever-increasing
requirement for continuous deployment and large applications containing
vast amounts of source code. In these environments, automation and
accuracy are absolute necessities in order to achieve high rates of
vulnerability detection and furthermore, taking the right preventive
actions.

To address these challenges our research turned to the field of Big Data
analysis to integrate their advanced technologies into our research. In
this talk we present our research methodology and findings. In
particular, we show how to:

1.  Adopt new technologies from the Big Data realm - used to locate
    required data and enable proper call for action – and apply them
    into source code analysis
2.  Identify security vulnerabilities through code irregularities using
    the Wisdom of the Crowds (large scale apps reference)
3.  Optimize vulnerability remediation of large result sets using smart
    graph methods that pinpoint vulnerability junctions and best-fix
    locations

### Web Security - New Browser Security Technologies

**Tobias Gondrom** [(Download the
Presentation)](https://owasp.org/images/b/b8/APAC13_TobiasGondrom.pdf)

This is cutting edge and will talk about new browser security
technologies that have recently been developed and/or will be coming up
in the coming months to counter risks that became apparent from the
current trust model used in browsers. This will be improving channel
protection and enabling better protection against XSS, Clickjacking and
XSRF.

In the recent months global standard developing bodies and the browser
vendors have in a joined effort developed and implemented many new major
security capabilities in the browsers allowing web application
developers to counter common security problems with comprehensive new
mechanisms. This talk will be talking about:

  - Channel protection: Securing SSL against Man-in-the-middle-attacks:
    New technologies - HTTP Strict Transport Security and and Pinning of
    Certs
  - Protection against XSS and clickjacking: the future of
    X-Frame-Options and the Content Security Policy

The presented technologies are cutting edge and although some parts of
the specifications are not final yet, they will be rolled-out in about 6
months time.

### What your CISO has not told you - Outbound security of cloud and enterprise web services

**Wong Onn Chee** [(Download the
Presentation)](https://owasp.org/images/4/4b/APAC13_Wong_Onn_Chee.pdf)

This presentation will cover an important topic which no CISO ever
mentions. Cloud and enterprise e-services are accessible 24x7 by anyone
across the world, especially via mobile devices. Yet, efforts for past
decades have sorely neglected the outbound risks of enterprise
e-services and, in recent years, cloud and mobile services. Without
outbound protection, incidents such as leaking private data, infecting
visitors with malware and displaying defaced web pages are often
reported by the press, damaging reputation and customer confidence. With
tighter data privacy laws, many organisations are risking hefty legal
penalties if they continue to neglect this risk area.

This talk will highlight the growing trend of web sites being used to
leak information, transmit malware and display defaced content. The
speaker will walk through a number of case studies and share with the
audience on the lessons learnt from each case study. The speaker will
also explain how the lack of outbound security protection contributed to
the realized risk in each case study.

### OWASP AppSensor the future of Application Security

**Dennis Groves** [(Download the
Presentation)](https://owasp.org/images/8/88/APAC13_Dennis_Groves.pdf)

The OWASP AppSensor is commonly described as an application layer
intrusion detection system. However, it is far more that this. It is
also an architecture design pattern, as well as a development practice
and an operations methodology. I propose the following outline for my
talk:

1.  (describe) I will describe what OWASP AppSenor is and why you would
    want one.
2.  (design) I will give a brief talk about the principles of secure
    architecture and design.
3.  I will give a brief history of IDS and NIDS, their strengths and
    weaknesses.
4.  I will then discuss how how and where AppSensor fits into that
    history, and how it improves upon the past for example:
5.  (development) The concept in implementation is roughly analogous to
    an intrusion detection (and prevention) system in the network
    security world. However, this concept can be applied inside of an
    application in a more specific way that (importantly) reduces false
    positives, which is an issue that often plagues network intrusion
    detection systems. This means that the core of the AppSensor system
    performs detection, monitoring, and (possibly) response depending on
    configuration settings.
6.  (deployment) I will the discuss deployment and operation of
    AppSensor.
7.  I will then describe why I believe this is the most important
    development in application security, and why everbody will develop
    software this way by the end of the decade.
8.  I will then propose future developments and enhancements for the
    OWASP AppSensor

### Using ESAPI for Java to Build Secure Web Applications

**Jim Manico** [(Download the
Presentation)](https://owasp.org/images/5/57/APAC13_Jim_Manico.pdf)

We cannot “firewall” or “patch” our way to secure websites. In the past,
security professionals thought firewalls, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL),
patching, and privacy policies were enough. Today, however, these
methods are outdated and ineffective, as attacks on prominent,
well-protected websites are occurring every day. Organizations around
the world rely on web security services to maintain the safety of their
websites in today’s hostile online environment. Website developers must
also learn to code in a secure fashion to have any chance of providing
organizations with proper defenses in the current threat-scape. The
session will provide specific tips and guidelines to make website code
both low risk and less vulnerable using the OWASP ESAPI for Java
project.

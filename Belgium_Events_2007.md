        **ISSA Intro**
\* 19h00 - 20h00: Patrick Debois
:**Operational security impact on developing secure applications**

  -
    As an experienced programmer you are well experienced in applying
    the OWASP guidelines. At least we hope so ;-) Still we are ainly
    involved :within the creation of the application during a project
    phase. But good security management goes beyond that one phase,
    enter the operational security. Not having programming skills, these
    operationalunits over the years have created several security layers
    around the applications. Think firewalls, intrusion detection,
    prevention, antivirus systems... These server and network oriented
    security measures more and more influence application deployment and
    can also benefit from better application integration.
    This presentation will show you the impact of f.i. central
    logmanagement, patch management, identity & access management,
    loadbalancing, antivirus .. can have on the application deployment
    and how with little modification of our application it can make a
    whole world of difference to the security in the trenches. They will
    be complementary to the OWASP set of guidelines. Also developers
    will get a better understanding of an additional set of
    non-functional requirements that are security related.
    **Patrick Debois** has been an independent consultant for 15 years
    and is fascinated by the transition of a projects into operational
    mode. In order to better understand this interaction, he frequently
    changes his role from being a project manager, systems engineer,
    tester and developer.
    His two main technical point of interests are:
      - portal, cms, dms, search (f.i. brussels airport,
        eurocontrol,www.vrtnieuws.net)
      - identity/access management: (f.i. ministry of Finance, flemish
        government, telenet).
    Complementary to these technical skills, he stimulates the human
    factor within projects by using both coaching (NLP) and project
    manamagement skils(Lean, Scrum).In his latest assignment he is
    experimenting with Scrum and Coaching within an operational team.

  - 20h00 - 20h15: break
  - 20h15 - 21h15: Herman Stevens & Swa Frantzen, NET2S

<!-- end list -->

  -
    **Security awareness programs for development**
    Security awareness programs for developers are an effective tool to
    improve not just the security but can be used as a vehicle to
    improve efficiency in the development cycle just as well. This talk
    gives an overview of what the different roles in a development
    department need to know and introduces some key concepts in order to
    make such a program a success. Real examples from actual security
    awareness trainings will be given as well.
    **Swa Frantzen** first encountered the Internet in its very early
    days at the KULeuven as a system administrator at the Computer
    Science department. Ever since he developed an active interest in
    the security consequences of that network of networks. Swa served in
    different functions at different levels between engineering and
    management in the security service industry (Ubizen, Telindus, SANS,
    NET2S) and the telecommunications world (EUnet, Scarlet). Currently
    he is an independent security consultant. He is also one of the
    handlers at the SANS Internet Storm Center.
    **Herman Stevens** (CISA, CISSP) works in the information security
    field since nearly a decade. At Smals-MvM he developed applications
    regarding the Belgian social security system. He started at Ubizen
    as the security product trainer, and later was asked to become
    information security consultant. The bulk of his work became doing
    risk assessments, creating security policies, performing PCI audits
    and especially application security related work such as application
    security reviews, penetration testing, code review and training
    developers. Currently he works as a senior consultant at NET2S,
    where he focuses on security awareness training for development
    teams.

#### OWASP Evaluation and Certification Criteria Draft (Mark Curphey)

Download
[presentation](:Image:OWASP_Day_-_Belgium_-_Curphey.pdf "wikilink").

As opposed to me continuing saying what’s wrong with PCI DSS, it seems
to me that OWASP is a perfect forum to simply create and publish a
“better criteria”. This can either be adopted and implemented by an
organization like OWASP or considered to be incorporated into the PCI or
other security standards. We won't get bogged down in the politics
up-front, but hold something good up to the world for people to adopt.
This project would of course draw on and bring together many of the
other OWASP Projects including the Guide (What is a secure web app),
Testing Guides (How to test for a secure web app), WebGoat (part of how
to certify an individual understands and can find web app issues) etc.
Many of those projects may not be complete or a perfect fit today, but
this project can bring a common connecting theme to a lot of very
valuable IP that OWASP has built over the years. I will also create it
in such as way that a corporate could adopt/adapt it themseles as well
as an industry. Where other OWASP projects are not complete or currently
suitable I will build a requirements doc that can be considered by those
teams if they feel appropriate.

[Mark Curphey](http://securitybuddha.com/about/) ran Foundstone
consulting from 2003 until late 2006 during which time the company was
sold to McAfee. Before joining Foundstone Mark was the Director of

We take a look into automated web application testing technologies and
their effectiveness against real life applications.

Also, we look into one of GNUCITIZENs latest projects, The Technika
Security Framework (TSF), which will enable users to automate security
testing directly from their browser.

[David Kierznowski](http://gnucitizen.org/about/dk) currently works as a
Senior Security Analyst for a leading penetration testing company in the

#### OWASP Pantera Unleashed (Simon Roses Femerling)

Download
[presentation](:Image:OWASPDay2007Belgium_Pantera_Unleash.ppt "wikilink").

The presentation will provide a glimpse into what Pantera can offer when
performing blackbox web assessments. In the age of Web 2.0 we need
powerful tools that provide us rich and accurate information and allows
us to manipulate that information into our advantage, that's what
Pantera is all about.

Simon Roses Femerling is a Security Technologist at the [ACE
Team](http://blogs.msdn.com/ace_team/) at Microsoft. Former PwC and

#### CLASP, SDL and Touchpoints Compared (Bart De Win)

Download
[presentation](:Image:OWASPDay2007Belgium_BartDeWin.ppt "wikilink").

Over the years, specific methodologies and techniques for secure
software engineering have been proposed, yet dedicated processes have
become available only recently. In this presentation, the highlights of
an activity-driven comparison of three high-profile processes for the
development of secure software are presented.

Bart De Win is a postdoctoral researcher in the research group
DistriNet, Department of Computer Science at the Katholieke Universiteit
Leuven. His research interests are in secure software engineering,
including software development processes, aspect-oriented software
development and model driven security.

#### Threats of e-insecurity in Belgium and the Belgian response (Luc Beirens, FCCU)

Download
[presentation](:Image:OWASP_Day_Belgium_FCCU_e-insecurity.pdf "wikilink").

The presentation will give a short overview of the actual threats on the
e-society in Belgium. How are public and private sector organized (or
not) to tacle the different problems ? What are the tasks of the police
within this framework ?

Since 1991, chief superintendent Luc Beirens is engaged in computer
forensics and cyber crime investigations. He is head of the Federal
Computer Crime Unit of the Federal Police since 2001. Aside consulting
his detectives in current cyber crime investigations, he is responsible
for the reorganization, the equipment and the training of Belgian police
services concerned with cyber crime investigations. As member of the
European Working Party on Information Technology Crime (EWPITC) of
Interpol since 1995 and the EUROPOL cyber crime expert group since 2001,
he has cooperated in writing several documents concerning computer
forensics and cyber crime investigations. He lectures in these fields at
several police academies and universities. His is involved in several
organizations and platforms that are concerned with e-security, ICT
forensics and cyber crime combating. Before his detective career, he has
worked from 1987 till 1995 as analyst and project manager on the
development of the Police Information System of the Belgian Gendarmerie.
He holds master degrees in criminology and information technology.

#### For my next trick... hacking Web2.0 (pdp)

Download
[presentation](:Image:OWASP_Day_Belgium_2007-pdp.ppt "wikilink").

Web2.0, if I can summarize it with a few simple words, is all about
communication, distribution, information, agents, clients and servers.
Those who understand the 2.0 fundamentals have the power to manipulate
the global Web to suit their needs - hackers, the new digital breed of
the 2.0 world. Web2.0 hacking is a mean for communicating and
distributing critical information in a better way. It can be used to
build ghost infrastructures from where to launch attacks - anonymously,
no traces, nothing. Web2.0 hacking is also about the thin line between
client-side and server-side security. It is about the endpoints and the
electronic highways. It is about reaching the masses and yet being able
to perform attacks on specific targets. Web2.0 hacking is also about
distribution and influence, covert channels, bots, IA, ghosts inside the
electronic frame. Web2.0 hacking is also a movement, a cyber subculture
where individuals show their technical abilities, and understandings of
the world and use that to manipulate their way through the system.

Web2.0 hacking practices should never be related to AJAX and JavaScript
exploitation techniques only. Although it is true that client-side
security has a significant part of the Web2.0 ecosystem, it is important
to realize its role. There are far too many other aspects that we need
to look into. My aim is to cover these aspects and reveal the hidden
dangers.

        **Buffer Overflows on .Net and Asp.Net**
:One of the common myths about the .Net Framework is that it is immune
to Buffer Overflows. Although this might be correct in pure managed and
verifiable .Net code, large percentage of .Net and Asp.Net applications
code is unmanaged code. In this talk Dinis will show the areas in .Net
and Asp.Net applications that are vulnerable to Buffer Overflows
(including the demo of a .Net Buffer Overflow Fuzzer).

case study on indirect data
sharing](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Image:OWASP_BeLux_2007-05-10_AppSec_Research_Lieven_Desmet.zip)**
*(Presentation + Discussion)*
:Several research tracks focus on tools and techniques to verify or
guarantee the absence of implementation bugs in web applications, either
at compile-time or at run-time. By guaranteeing the absence of certain
implementation bugs, the reliability and security of the application can
be improved. In this presentation, we will focus on the absence of
implementation bugs due to broken data dependencies.

  -
    Web applications typically share non-persistent session data between
    different parts of the application, e.g. a shopping cart in a
    e-commerce application. By doing so, implicit dependencies arise
    between the different parts of the application, and breaking these
    dependencies in an application may result in information leakage of
    erroneous behavior.
    In our research, we explicitly model dependencies between components
    that indirectly share data. Next, we verify that in a given
    composition these dependencies are not broken by applying a
    combination of static verification and dynamic checking (e.g. by
    using a Web Application Firewall).
    We validated the presented approach in two existing applications: a
    Struts-based, open-source webmail application (GatorMail) and an
    e-commerce site (Duke's BookStore from the J2EE 1.4 tutorial).

        *'[Security implications of AOP for secure
software](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Image:OWASP_BE_2007-01-23_AOP_security.zip)
Over the last decade, Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP), a development
paradigm that focuses on improving the modularisation of crosscutting
concerns, has received a great deal of attention from the academic as
well as from the industrial community. In the context of secure software
development, AOP has been shown to bring a number of benefits, at least
from a software engineering perspective. From a security perspective,
the characteristics of AOP have been studied less. One of the key
questions at this moment is whether we can really use AOP to build
\\emph{secure} software ?
In this presentation we will address this key question by elaborating on
a number of security implications of AOP. Risks will be shown to
originate from the core concepts of AOP, as well as from tool-specific
implementation strategies (with a specific focus on AspectJ). The
presentation will be concluded by indicating how these risks could be

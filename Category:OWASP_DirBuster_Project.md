DirBuster is a multi threaded java application designed to brute force
directories and files names on web/application servers. Often is the
case now of what looks like a web server in a state of default
installation is actually not, and has pages and applications hidden
within. DirBuster attempts to find these.

However tools of this nature are often as only good as the directory and
file list they come with. A different approach was taken to generating
this. The list was generated from scratch, by crawling the Internet and
collecting the directory and files that are actually used by
developers\! DirBuster comes a total of 9 different lists (Further
information can be found below), this makes DirBuster extremely
effective at finding those hidden files and directories. And if that was
not enough DirBuster also has the option to perform a pure brute force,
which leaves the hidden directories and files nowhere to hide\! If you
have the time ;)

#### DirBuster Fork

Please note that DirBuster is currently an inactive project.

However it has essentially been forked by the [OWASP
ZAP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/ZAP) team. It is now included in
the ZAP Marketplace as a ZAP add-on rather than as a stand-alone tool.

The source code for this fork can be found in:

  - [zap-extensions/tree/beta/src/com/sittinglittleduck/DirBuster](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-extensions/tree/beta/src/com/sittinglittleduck/DirBuster)
    : the DirBuster code

#### News

**22nd October 2009 - Perl Module to Parse DirBuster XML output**

A big thanks to Jabra for producing a Perl module for parsing the XML
reports produced by DirBuster. Currently this will only work with the
latest version in cvs, however I am on a final push to get 1.0 out the
door, so it will not stay that way for long\!

<http://search.cpan.org/~jabra/Dirbuster-Parser-0.01/lib/Dirbuster/Parser.pod>

**3rd March 2009 - Version 1.0-RC1**

After some major code changes I have opted for a release candidate
before 1.0, to weed out any bugs. Features introduced in this release
are:

  - Auto pause, when 20 consecutive 20 errors happen
  - Spelling mistakes corrected
  - Multi threaded all the work generation, so multiple dir and file
    exts are scanned at the same time (this makes it much faster\!)
  - Reconstructed multiple parts of the code
  - Proxy settings are now persistent
  - The ability to change the look and feel has now been added
  - Added Jbrofuzz dir list (Thank you Yiannis)
  - Removed the two large dir lists
  - Added new reporting formats (simple lists, xml, csv)

This version can be downloaded from
[here](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=199126&package_id=236213&release_id=664415).

If you find any bugs with this release let me know. ([Add a new
Bug](https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&group_id=199126&atid=968238))
I plan to release 1.0 in the next couple of weeks.

**3rd October 2008 - Version 0.12 is now available**

  - Command line interface added
  - Fixed a bug that caused the "User Agent" to not get set when adding
    custom headers
  - Updated all api's used

**22th August 2008 - Mac dmg for 0.11.1 is now available**

  - A Mac package for version is available, big thanks to Richard Dean
    for this.

**20th August 2008 - Version 0.11.1 is now available**

  - Fixed a bug that caused the check for updates not to work correctly

**20th August 2008 - Version 0.11 is now available**

  - Added a windows installer
  - Added more content to the help section, but it's not finished yet.
  - Improved the way in which DirBuster handles inconsistent fail codes
  - Fixed a bug that caused deadlock due to all the parsing threads
    exiting
  - Tweaked the content analysis code to reduce false positives, when
    DirBuster is using that mode
  - Added code to make sure it display correctly on Vista
  - Fixed a bug that caused files found to not be shown in the report
  - Slight tweak to worker to improve performance
  - Fixed a couple of points within the GUI, and spelling mistakes.

#### Overview

![DirBuster-Main-small.png](DirBuster-Main-small.png
"DirBuster-Main-small.png") DirBuster is a multi threaded java
application designed to brute force directories and files names on
web/application servers. Often is the case now of what looks like a web
server in a state of default installation is actually not, and has pages
and applications hidden within. DirBuster attempts to find these.

However tools of this nature are often as only good as the directory and
file list they come with. A different approach was taken to generating
this. The list was generated from scratch, by crawling the Internet and
collecting the directory and files that are actually used by
developers\! DirBuster comes a total of 9 different lists (Further
information can be found below), this makes DirBuster extremely
effective at finding those hidden files and directories. And if that was
not enough DirBuster also has the option to perform a pure brute force,
which leaves the hidden directories and files nowhere to hide\! If you
have the time ;)

### What DirBuster can do for you

  - Attempt to find hidden pages/directories and directories with a web
    application, thus giving a another attack vector (For example.
    Finding an unlinked to administration page).

### What DirBuster will not do for you

  - Exploit anything it finds. This is not the purpose of DirBuster.
    DirBuster sole job is to find other possible attack vectors.

### How does DirBuster help in the building of secure applications?

  - By finding content on the web server or within the application that
    is not required.
  - By helping developers understand that by simply not linking to a
    page does not mean it can not be accessed.

## Project Goals

The goals for the DirBuster Project are as follows:

  - To produce a tool to that will assist in black box application
    testing, by trying to find hidden content.
  - Ensure the tool produced provides information is such a way that any
    false positives produce can be quickly identified.
  - Produce text based lists that can be used by the above mentioned
    tool.

## Future Development Plans

  - Improve and finish the java portion of the program
      - Add documentation about the program eg Help, FAQ's
      - Fully document the code
  - Improve the DirBuster spider engine that generates the lists
      - Gather information on things like cookie names, sub domain
        names, POST and GET variable names

## Road Map

  - 0.9.8 - Add HTML parsing (Complete)
  - 0.9.9 - Implement the skip work functionality, NTLM auth (Complete)
  - 0.9.10 - Maintenance release to fix a bug (Complete)
  - 1.0 - Complete documentation, generate new lists
  - 1.1 - Implement functionality to process lists of default files and
    directories

#### The DirBuster Lists

DirBuster comes with a set of unique directory and files lists, these
have been generated based on the file and directory names that are
actually used by developers on internet sites. The order of the lists is
based on the frequency of the item found. Therefore the most common
items appear at the top. These lists are what make DirBuster.

**NOTE**: It will come as no surprise to you all that the internet is
full of porn, thus it not surprising that the spider used to generate
the lists visited a few along the way. Thus there are explicit words
contained within the lists. My stand point on this is simple, this tool
was designed to used as part of legitimate security testing, and if
there are directories/files based on explicit words, clients would want
to know\!\!

The following lists are included with DirBuster, or as a separate
download:

  - **directory-list-2.3-small.txt** - (87650 words) - Directories/files
    that where found on at least 3 different hosts
  - **directory-list-2.3-medium.txt** - (220546 words) -
    Directories/files that where found on at least 2 different hosts
  - **directory-list-2.3-big.txt** - (1273819 words) - All
    directories/files that where found
  - **directory-list-lowercase-2.3-small.txt** - (81629 words) - Case
    insensitive version of directory-list-2.3-small.txt
  - **directory-list-lowercase-2.3-medium.txt** - (207629 words) - Case
    insensitive version of directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
  - **directory-list-lowercase-2.3-big.txt** - (1185240 words) - Case
    insensitive version of directory-list-2.3-big.txt
  - **directory-list-1.0.txt** - (141694 words) - Original unordered
    list
  - **apache-user-enum-1.0.txt** - (8916 usernames) - Used for guessing
    system users on apache with the userdir module enabled, based on a
    username list I had lying around (unordered)
  - **apache-user-enum-2.0.txt** - (10341 usernames) - Used for guessing
    system users on apache with the userdir module enabled, based on
    \~XXXXX found during list generation (Ordered)

A download of just the lists can be obtained from here:

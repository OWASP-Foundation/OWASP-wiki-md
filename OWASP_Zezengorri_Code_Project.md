<p><strong>Zezengorri</strong> is a library that allows you to add security to your development IDE from day one. From the moment you decide to implement secure development to your projects.</p>
<p>You can start either while designing your new projects or implement it in old projects. You can use it to detect vulnerabilities of your web server and the programming language even before starting the development parallel to the system development life circle.</p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>Whenever developers, team leaders or project managers add security to a web application, the first question that comes to mind is which technologies will be implemented in the web project, what operating system is supported by the web server and on which version the server or database runs. For these reasons, OWASP defined a threat modeling document.</p>
<p>This project <strong>Zezengorri</strong> is a code library is a downloadable package that adheres to the root of the web project, and from them this can, analyzes and seeks to collect in a simple web page the characteristics of all the security components for examples: if our website uses or not <strong>HSTS</strong>, the versions of <strong>Chipset</strong> active, the use of <strong>SSL</strong> certificate for the web page among other securities characteristics important measure in the during the life cycle development software . Each of these item is display in a new web page in a list of item any show if is active or not, the version of the plugin and a web link. That links redirect to the <strong>CVE</strong> page and the <strong>CVE</strong> score of this item. determine if the project can be promoted to the next category. The information requested is also intended to help Project Leaders think about the road map and feature priorities, and give guidance to the reviews as a result of that effort.</p>
<p>Apart from detecting and resolving security issues, the recompiled information is also useful to project leaders who can use it to create risk-models for the websites they manage.</p>

# FAQs

\==How can I participate in our project?== If you have experience in web
development using for example: Node.JS, C\# or Java and are interested
in learning about applications security please contact us via the
official mail: **gustavo.nievesarreaza@owasp.com**

## If I am not a programmer can I participate in our project?

Yes, you can certainly participate in the project if you are not a
programmer or technician. The project needs different skills and
expertise for different times during its development ,Currently we are
looking for IT persons that are willing to investigate how implement and
improve the security in applications.

We are looking right now people for make our:

**-QA**

**-Marketing**

**-Development (using Node.Js and Python)**

# Acknowledgements

## Volunteers

The OWASP Security **Zenzengorri** Principles project is developed by a
worldwide team of volunteers. A live update of project contributors is
found here .

The first contributors to the project are:

**-Lubyn Rodriguez(PM)**

**-Hernan Pantoja(Developer)**

# Road Map and Getting Involved

## Roadmap

As of ***february* , 2017, the highest priorities for the next 6
months** are: 

  - Complete the first draft of the Code Project Template
  - Get other people to review the Code Project Template and provide
    feedback
  - Incorporate feedback into changes in the Code Project Template
  - Finalize the Code Project template and have it reviewed to be
    promoted from an

As of **august , 2017, the highest priorities for the next 6 months**
are:

  - Promote the library in conferences
  - Get academic support
  - Recruit more volunteers

As of **march , 2018, the highest priorities for the next 6 months**
are:

  - Release version of library 1.0
  - Fundraise for growth the project

<strong></strong>

## Getting Involved

### Coding

If you have experience in programming in Node.js or Python and you want
programming tools for secure applications.

### Testing

Do you have a flair for finding bugs in software? We want to product a
high quality product, so any help with Quality Assurance would be
greatly appreciated. Let us know if you can offer your help.

# Minimal Viable Product

The functionalities of this code library are when it is downloaded and
implemented.

`-Detect vulnerabilities`
`-Compare vulnerabilities, with an updated database online.`
`-Ranking the severity of vulnerabilities`
`-Show how fix the vulnerabilities`
`-Define you own security test in you own program language.`

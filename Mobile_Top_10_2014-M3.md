`    <td ``>When designing a mobile application, data is commonly exchanged in a client-server fashion. When the solution transmits its data, it must traverse the mobile device's carrier network and the internet. Threat agents might exploit vulnerabilities to intercept sensitive data while it's traveling across the wire. The following threat agents exist:`

  - An adversary that shares your local network (compromised or
    monitored Wi-Fi);
  - Carrier or network devices (routers, cell towers, proxy's, etc); or
  - Malware on your mobile device.

`    <td ``> The exploitabilty factor of monitoring a network for insecure communications ranges. Monitoring traffic over a carrier's network is harder than that of monitoring a local coffee shop's traffic. In general, targeted attacks are easier to perform.  `

</td>

`    <td colspan=2  ``>Mobile applications frequently do not protect network traffic. They may use SSL/TLS during authentication but not elsewhere.  This inconsistency leads to the risk of exposing data and session IDs to interception.`

The use of transport security does not mean the app has implemented it
correctly.

To detect basic flaws, observe the phone's network traffic. More subtle
flaws require inspecting the design of the application and the
applications configuration.

`    <td ``>This flaw exposes an individual user's data and can lead to account theft. If the adversary intercepts an admin account, the entire site could be exposed. Poor SSL setup can also facilitate phishing and MITM attacks.`

`    <td ``>At a minimum, interception of sensitive data through a communication channel will result in a privacy violation.`

The violation of a user's confidentiality may result in:

  - Identity theft;
  - Fraud, or
  - Reputational Damage.

To find out if an application has sufficient transport layer protection,
look at the application traffic through a proxy. Answer the following
questions:

1.  Are all connections, not just ones to servers you own, properly
    encrypted?
2.  Are the SSL certificates in date?
3.  Are the SSL certificates self signed?
4.  Does the SSL use high enough cipher strengths?
5.  Will your application accept user accepted certificates as
    authorities?

**General Best Practices:**

  - Assume that the network layer is not secure and is susceptible to
    eavesdropping.
  - Apply SSL/TLS to transport channels that the mobile app will use to
    transmit sensitive information, session tokens, or other sensitive
    data to a backend API or web service.
  - Account for outside entities like third-party analytics companies,
    social networks, etc. by using their SSL versions when an
    application runs a routine via the browser/webkit. Avoid mixed SSL
    sessions as they may expose the user’s session ID.
  - Use strong, industry standard cipher suites with appropriate key
    lengths.
  - Use certificates signed by a trusted CA provider.
  - Never allow self-signed certificates, and consider certificate
    pinning for security conscious applications.
  - Always require SSL chain verification.
  - Only establish a secure connection after verifying the identity of
    the endpoint server using trusted certificates in the key chain.
  - Alert users through the UI if the mobile app detects an invalid
    certificate.
  - Do not send sensitive data over alternate channels (e.g, SMS, MMS,
    or notifications).
  - If possible, apply a separate layer of encryption to any sensitive
    data before it is given to the SSL channel. In the event that future
    vulnerabilities are discovered in the SSL implementation, the
    encrypted data will provide a secondary defense against
    confidentiality violation.

Newer threats allow an adversary to eavesdrop on sensitive traffic by
intercepting the traffic within the mobile device just before the mobile
device's SSL library encrypts and transmits the network traffic to the
destination server. See M10 for more information on the nature of this
risk.

**iOS Specific Best Practices**

Default classes in the latest version of iOS handle SSL cipher strength
negotiation very well. Trouble comes when developers temporarily add
code to bypass these defaults to accommodate development hurdles. In
addition to the above general practices:

  - Ensure that certificates are valid and fail closed.
  - When using CFNetwork, consider using the Secure Transport API to
    designate trusted client certificates. In almost all situations,
    NSStreamSocketSecurityLevelTLSv1 should be used for higher standard
    cipher strength.
  - After development, ensure all NSURL calls (or wrappers of NSURL) do
    not allow self signed or invalid certificates such as the NSURL
    class method setAllowsAnyHTTPSCertificate.
  - Consider using certificate pinning by doing the following: export
    your certificate, include it in your app bundle, and anchor it to
    your trust object. Using the NSURL method
    connection:willSendRequestForAuthenticationChallenge: will now
    accept your cert.

**Android Specific Best Practices**

  - Remove all code after the development cycle that may allow the
    application to accept all certificates such as
    org.apache.http.conn.ssl.AllowAllHostnameVerifier or
    SSLSocketFactory.ALLOW_ALL_HOSTNAME_VERIFIER. These are
    equivalent to trusting all certificates.
  - If using a class which extends SSLSocketFactory, make sure
    checkServerTrusted method is properly implemented so that server
    certificate is correctly checked.

There are a few common scenarios that penetration testers frequently
discover when inspecting a mobile app's transport layer security:

  - Lack of Certificate Inspection
    The mobile app and an endpoint successfully connect and perform a
    SSL/TLS handshake to establish a secure channel. However, the mobile
    app fails to inspect the certificate offered by the server and the
    mobile app unconditionally accepts any certificate offered to it by
    the server. This destroys any mutual authentication capability
    between the mobile app and the endpoint. The mobile app is
    susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks through a SSL proxy
  - Weak Handshake Negotiation
    The mobile app and an endpoint successfully connect and negotiate a
    cipher suite as part of the connection handshake. The client
    successfully negotiates with the server to use a weak cipher suite
    that results in weak encryption that can be easily decrypted by the
    adversary. This jeopardizes the confidentiality of the channel
    between the mobile app and the endpoint;
  - Privacy Information Leakage
    The mobile app transmits personally identifiable information to an
    endpoint via non-secure channels instead of over SSL. This
    jeopardizes the confidentiality of any privacy-related data between
    the mobile app and the endpoint.

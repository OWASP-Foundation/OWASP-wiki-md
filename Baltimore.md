# Welcome to OWASP Baltimore

<tr class="odd">
<td><p>The <strong>OWASP Baltimore Local Chapter</strong> meetings are FREE and OPEN to anyone interested in learning more about application security. We encourage individuals to provide knowledge transfer via hands-on training and presentations about OWASP projects, security research topics, and the Software Development Life Cycle.</p>
<p>The chapter is committed to providing an engaging experience for a variety of audience types ranging from local students and those beginning in AppSec to experienced and accomplished professionals and researchers who are looking for competent collaborators for active OWASP-related projects.</p>
<p>We encourage vendor-agnostic presentations and individual volunteerism to enable perpetual growth. As a 501(3)c non-profit association, we encourage donations of meeting space, catering, and event sponsorship. Simply contact the local chapter leaders listed on this page to discuss.</p>

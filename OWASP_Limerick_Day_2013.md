<br />
Social enterprise is reshaping the way employees communicate, work and collaborate for increased productivity. With all such benefits for the business, it could be easy to overlook the security risks. From exposure of confidential data and files, to the classic Cross-Site Scripting and Insecure Direct Object Reference issues, the lack of proper security controls could lead to serious data breaches. Unfortunately, social enterprise solutions are not immune to such risks.<br />
Marian will present various security risks identified for representative social enterprise solutions (from Salesforce, Blogtronix, Tibco , Yammer and Jive), while also providing recommendations on effective risks mitigation for adoption of social enterprise solutions.</p></td>

<br />
In this hands-on talk, Angelo and Yoel will introduce new targeted techniques and research that allows an attacker to reliably retrieve encrypted secrets (session identifiers, CSRF tokens, OAuth tokens, email addresses, ViewState hidden fields, etc.) from an HTTPS channel. They will demonstrate this new browser vector is real and practical by executing a PoC against a major enterprise product in under 30 seconds. They will also describe the algorithm behind the attack, how the usage of basic statistical analysis can be applied to extract data from dynamic pages, as well as practical mitigations you can implement today. They will also describe the posture of different SaaS vendors vis-à-vis this attack while also presenting the BREACH tool.</p></td>

# Welcome

### Welcome to [OWASP SAMM Project](OWASP_SAMM_Project "wikilink") Summit 2016

Read the wrap-up of the Summit here:
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/19_LC1euR7ZuazRYgeblhPE1Fv6E8N56Bu8zANq2JB30/edit>

The SAMM Summit is not a regular conference with speaking slots, but a
summit where the participants work together in a 2-day sprint on SAMMv2.

If you are interested to contribute to this, you are most welcome
(knowledge of SAMM or other secure development methodology experience is
a **prerequisite**)

This is an excellent opportunity to influence the direction of SAMM and
exchange experiences with your peers.

testimonial from 2015:

"The SAMM summit provided an opportunity to breathe new life into a
framework that I use to facilitate my day-to-day work and support my
customers." Bruce C Jenkins, Fortify Security Lead, Hewlett-Packard
Company

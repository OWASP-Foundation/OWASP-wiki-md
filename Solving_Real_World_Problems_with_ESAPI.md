\== The presentation ==

![Owasp_logo_normal.jpg](Owasp_logo_normal.jpg
"Owasp_logo_normal.jpg")A great deal of work has gone into aggregating
statistics and information about security vulnerabilities in enterprise
applications on the internet. A lot of work has also been done in
creating software libraries and secure coding guidelines to mitigate
vulnerabilities. The OWASP group has created an ESAPI that is meant to
act as a service provider of security to enterprise applications. There
is a lot of documentation and resources available on what an ESAPI is,
but there is not much information on how to actually implement an ESAPI
to mitigate a specific set of vulnerabilities in an application. This
presentation aims to provide information on how to use ESAPI to solve
real-world security problems in a clear and interactive way.

Using ESAPI for Java, I will demonstrate examples of vulnerabilities in
simple web applications, describe the problem and solution, then fix the
vulnerabilities. I will also discuss the importance of developing the
ESAPI to fit the business needs of the application.

The presentation will use OWASP ESAPI configured with the reference
implementations for Encoding/Decoding, Encryption, Logging, WAF, and
Validation. For Authentication and Access Control a custom
implementation will be used to show how easy it is to implement business
specific implementations into the ESAPI framework.

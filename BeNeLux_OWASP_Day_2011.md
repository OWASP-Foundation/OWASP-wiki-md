**OWASP Training: Secure Application Development, by Eoin Keary**

**Abstract:** Writing Secure code is the most effective method to
securing your web applications. Writing secure code takes skill and
know-how but results in a more stable and robust application and assists
in protecting an organisations brand. Application security is not
commonly a part of many computer science curricula today and most
organizations have not focused on instituting a culture that includes
application security as a core part of their software development
training efforts. This intensive one-day course focuses on the most
common web application security problems, including aspects of both the
OWASP Top Ten (2010) and the MITRE Top 25. The course will introduce and
demonstrate application assessment techniques, illustrating how
application vulnerabilities can be exploited so students really
understand how to avoid introducing such vulnerabilities in their code.

**This course includes coverage of the following areas:**

  - Unvalidated Input
  - Injection Flaws, OS commanding, SQL Injection
  - Cross-Site Scriping & Client-side security
  - CSRF/XSRF
  - Authentication & Session Management
  - Access control & Authorisation
  - Broken Caching
  - Error Handling & Resource Management
  - The Secure SDLC
  - Fuzzing, Proxy use and testing approach

**Hands on Exercises**

To cement the principles discussed, students can participate in a number
of hands-on security testing exercises where they attack a live web
application (i.e., OWASP Bank etc) that has been seeded with common web
application vulnerabilities.

The students will use proxy tools commonly used by the hacker community
to complete the exercises. Students need to bring their own windows
based laptop to participate in the exercises. Wireless capability is
recommended. **Make sure to get a copy of BURP proxy prior to the
training: <http://www.portswigger.net/burp/downloadfree.html>**

**Audience**

Developers who want to understand the most common web application
security flaws, and how to avoid them and code in a secure manner.

Level: Beginner/Intermediate

Prerequisite: Basic knowledge of a web programming language like Java or
.NET recommended but not required.

Bringing your own windows based laptop is recommended so you can
participate in the hands on exercises

##### Extra session on Security testing: a key challenge for software engineering of web apps (17h00 - 18h00)

While important efforts are dedicated to system functional testing, very
few works study how to specifically and systematically test security
mechanisms. In this talk, we will present two categories of approaches.
The first ones aim at assessing security mechanisms compliance with
declared policies. Any security policy is strongly connected to system
functionality: testing function includes exercising many security
mechanisms. However, testing functionality does not intend at exercizing
all security mechanisms. We thus propose test selection criteria to
produce tests from a security policy. Empirical results will be
presented about access control policies and about Android apps
permission checks.

The second ones concern the attack surface of web apps, with a
particular focus on web browser sensitivity to XSS attacks. Indeed, one
of the major threats against web applications is Cross-Site Scripting
(XSS) that crosses several web components: web server, security
components and finally the client’s web browser. The final target is
thus the client running a particular web browser. During this last
decade, several competing web browsers (IE, Netscape, Chrome, Firefox)
have been upgraded to add new features for the final users benefit.
However, the improvement of web browsers is not related with systematic
security regression testing. Beginning with an analysis of their current
exposure degree to XSS, we extend the empirical study to a decade of
most popular web browser versions.The results reveal a chaotic behavior
in the evolution of most web browsers attack surface over time. This
particularly shows an urgent need for regression testing strategies to
ensure that security is not sacrificed when a new version is delivered.

In both cases, security must become a specific target for testing in
order to get a satisfying level of confidence in security mechanisms

##### OWASP SIMBA - guarding your applications (by [Koen Vanderloock](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/BeNeLux_OWASP_Day_2011#Koen_Vanderloock.2C_Leader_Security_Competence_Group_at_Cegeka), Leader Security Competence Group at Cegeka)

[SIMBA (Security Integration Module for Business
Applications)](OWASP_SIMBA_Project "wikilink") is a OWASP project that
provides you with a User Access Management system that can be integrated
with any business application. The purpose of SIMBA is to secure an
application fast and easy. Because SIMBA itself is generic it can be
customized for every project. Many features are customizable e.g.
designing your own authentication chain is easy and fast by using
existing or newly created building blocks. SIMBA contains
authentication, authorization, session management and a GUI to manage
your security information.

###### Koen Vanderloock, Leader Security Competence Group at Cegeka

investigating security issues and solutions so they could be included in
the current projects. Koen Vanderloock is a Java developer with 8 years
of experience and started exploring the world of security 3 years ago
when UAM problems started to occur.

##### Practical Crypto Attacks Against Web Applications (by [Justin Clarke](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/BeNeLux_OWASP_Day_2011#Justin_Clarke.2C_Director_and_Co-Founder_of_Gotham_Digital_Science_Ltd), Director and Co-Founder of Gotham Digital Science Ltd)

The science of cryptography underpins many of the information security
technologies we use on a daily basis, such as the ability to keep
information confidential and to ensure we can identify who we are
communicating with. However, it is a very complex subject area with many
types of mistakes that can reduce the overall security of a solution. A
number of these types of mistakes can be identified by a tester, if they
know what they're looking for, but in general it isn't a well tested
area.

This talk is intended to provide a high level overview of some of the
areas where cryptographic operations such as encryption and hashing can
provide far less security than was planned, and concrete examples of how
these were found and exploited. Examples will include discussion and
demonstration of the recently patched cryptographic padding attack
against the Microsoft .NET framework (affecting ASP.NET applications)
caused by a design error in how ASP.NET handles some types of encrypted
data, but we will also be looking at some other fun areas including bit
flipping attacks, ECB mode attacks, and some miscellaneous hashing
algorithm attacks against common web application implementations.

##### HTML5 security (by [Lieven Desmet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/BeNeLux_OWASP_Day_2011#Lieven_Desmet.2C_Research_Manager_at_Katholieke_Universiteit_Leuven), Research Manager at Katholieke Universiteit Leuven)

In this talk, Lieven will highlight the results of the HTML5 security
analysis, conducted by the DistriNet Research Group (K.U.Leuven). The
security analysis of next generation web standards, commissioned by
ENISA, looked into 13 emerging W3C web standards (i.e. the specification
of HTML 5 and some of the associated APIs), and assessed the security of
each of them as well as the overall security and consistency across
specifications.

In total 51 security threats and issues have been identified, and
detailed in the ENISA report (http://www.enisa.europa.eu/html5). During
the talk, Lieven will discuss the methodology developed to assess the
huge amount of specifications, and zoom into a representative set of
identified threats and their remediation.

##### Overcoming iOS Data Protection to Re-Enable iPhone Forensics (by [Andrey Belenko](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/BeNeLux_OWASP_Day_2011#Andrey_Belenko.2C_Chief_Security_Researcher_at_ElcomSoft), Chief Security Researcher at ElcomSoft)

Data protection is a feature available for iOS devices (iOS 4 and up)
with hardware encryption: iPhone 4S, iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, iPod touch
(3rd generation or later), and all iPad models. Introduction of this
feature had complicated iPhone forensics process because now (almost)
all files on user partition are encrypted and physical dumps are of much
less value to examiners: while the filesystem seems to be intact, actual
file contents are encrypted and are not suitable for analysis.

This talk will provide in-depth information about iOS Data protection
internals and on the implication it had on iOS forensics. More
specifically, it will cover the following:

  - System keys and their hierarchy
  - Device passcode and its recovery
  - Escrow keys
  - Filesystem encryption
  - Keychain encryption

Presentation will start by providing attendees with required background
on iOS encryption keys architecture: system keys, passcode key, escrow
key. After attendees are familiar with those concepts, presentation will
continue to filesystem and keychain encryption details and to the
techniques that can be used to overcome the hurdles imposed by iOS Data
Protection.

##### Do you... Legal? (by [Ludovic Petit](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/BeNeLux_OWASP_Day_2011#Ludovic_Petit.2C_Group_Fraud_.26_Information_Security_Adviser_at_SFR.2C_Vodafone_Group), Group Fraud & Information Security Adviser at SFR, Vodafone Group)

The OWASP core mission is to make application security visible, so that
people and organizations can make informed decisions about true
application security risks. However, if you do not pay enough attention
to many aspects of Legal compliance, you'll see why Web Application
Security is somehow linked to Legal and Regulatory aspects as well as...
Corporate Responsability, so yours. Who is accountable for what, what
about each other's responsibility? Nowadays, the legal constraints
oblige us to comply via technical means, whatever the local framework,
and this is specially true for Web Application Security, many sensitive
informations having to be handled through these web interfaces. A such,
what do you think about your Security Policy compliance with your local
Legal framework? Compliant? Sure? Really? Interesting isn't it? Let's
have a talk about this.

##### Dynamic malware analysis - or: The \~five deadly (anti-)venoms (by Sascha Rommelfangen, Incident Management - Security Research at CIRCL)

Malware reversing is a time consuming task. Many approaches are
available to dissect and analyse suspicious binaries. Dynamic malware
analysis is one of the option to better understand them and also a nifty
companion to static analysis. The current dynamic malware analysis
techniques will be presented especially the ones relying on instrumented
operating system systems (from the filesystem to the network stack).
You'll see a wandering through common and less common malware partially
analysed using dynamic analysis and how dynamic malware analysis can
help you.

##### The limits of e-banking (by Jean-Marc Bost and Sébastien Bischof, ECLA)

The swiss german TV channel SF1 showed a footage on swiss e-banking
security. The TV show follows a team of the ETH who earned a special
authorization to test several e-anking platforms. After admitting that a
personal computer can be infected by different means (actually 5% of the
tested PCs are infected according to Microsoft), The team from Zürich
showed the limits of the different platforms. Only the bank who signs
each transaction is labelled as safe. We will come back during the
presentation on the nature of the threat.
First of all, we will explain how famous malwares such as Zeus and
SpyEye manage to steal from their victims without them being able to
notice anything. Then we will see that e-banking is not the only target,
as a matter of fact, the reality is far from this.
And then we will comment the most recent techniques that allow malwares
to escape Antivirus and Antimalware programs even if they are up to
date. We will vulgarize several concepts such as DKOM and bootkits in
order to let everybody have a glimpse on the danger they represent.
Finally, we will think about if signing each transaction can efficiently
fight off these threats. In fact, when attacks are coupled with Social
Engineering, they have potentially no limit. Zeus is a living proof of
this fact, because it even managed to attack the transaction validation
system by SMS. As a conclusion, we will see that the e-banking platform
that managed to resist the tests of the ETH team is vulnerable to such
kind of attacks.

##### The Rise of the Vulnerability Markets - History, Impacts, Mitigations (by Thierry Zoller, Verizon)

A decade has gone by and the security area is no longer the same,
amongst other factors sophistication and motivation changed
tremendously. This talk will give you a crash course on the history of
vulnerability discovery and market value, a brief excurse into the world
of Vulnerability Markets, how they emerged, how they vary and what this
implies for those that are defending. The presentation will conclude
with an Attacker Classification System (Attacker Triad) and an
associated assurance model around OWASP OSVS. Some parts of this
presentation will only be done in live and will not be published after
this conference.

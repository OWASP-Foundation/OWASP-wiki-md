This Chapter describes how to value the real risk based on the results
of a security assessment. The idea is to create a general methodology to
break down the security findings and evaluate the risks with the goal of
prioritizing and managing those risks. The real risk is presented in a
table that can easily represent a snapshot of the assessment. This table
represents the technical information delivered to the client and it is
important to present an executive summary for the management.

# Application Security Requirements Project

\--- [Click here to return to OWASP Projects

----\>

## Overview

Clearly articulating project-agnostic application security requirements
—both general and specific requirements — is the best way to ensure
that software is developed under strong and workable security guidance

  - **Project purpose:** To assemble a useful base of generic security
    requirements that could be used in most applications.
  - **Intended audience:** Every person involved in application
    security, but especially for those responsible of sytem analysis and
    design.
  - **Project products:** Deliverables would be business-focused,
    developed for Business Analysts and Project Managers rather than
    software developers.

# About

# Roadmap

We are just re-starting the project after a couple of years without any
progress. We need all the help we can get to make this a successful
project

## Short-term actions

1.  . Identify (map from other owasp projects) categorization and
    prioritize
2.  . Identify software development standards to document requirements
3.  . Define work plan
4.  . Define document's introduction (scope of the document, composition
    of the document)
5.  . Write first draft related to web applications
6.  . Review and adjust plan

## Long-term actions

  - Write requirements for mobile applications
  - Write requirements for web services
  - Write requirements for mobile applications

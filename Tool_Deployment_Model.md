Deploying code review tools to developers helps the throughput of a code
review team by helping to identify and hopefully remove most of the
common and simple coding mistakes prior to a security consultant viewing
the code.

This methodology improves developer knowledge, and the security
consultant can spend time looking for more abstract vulnerabilities.

**Developer adoption model**

  - Deploy automated tools to developers.
  - Control tool rule base.
  - Security review results and probe a little further.

**Testing Department model**

  - Test department includes automated review in functional test.
  - Security review results and probe a little further.
  - Tool rule base is controlled by the security department and complies
    with internal secure application development policies.

**Application security group model**

  - All code goes through application security group.
  - Group use manual and automated solutions.

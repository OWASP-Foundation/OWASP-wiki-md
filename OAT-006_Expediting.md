"OAT-006_Expediting.png")

### Description

Using speed to violate explicit or implicit assumptions about the
applicationâ€™s normal use to achieve unfair individual gain, often
associated with deceit and loss to some other party.

In contrast to [OAT-016 Skewing](OAT-016_Skewing "wikilink") which
affects metrics, Expediting is purely related to faster progression
through a series of application processes. And [OAT-017
Spamming](OAT-017_Spamming "wikilink") is different to Expediting, since
the focus of spam is to add information, and may not involve the concept
of process progression.

### Other Names and Examples

automation; Gaming bot; Gold farming; Financial instrument dealing; High
frequency trading; Last look trade; Mining; Purchase automation;
Ticketing automation; Trading automation; Virtual wealth generation bot

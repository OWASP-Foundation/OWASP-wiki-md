<p>Modern applications leverage the availability of existing components for use as building blocks in application development. By using existing components, organizations can dramatically decrease time-to-market. Reusing existing components however, comes at a cost. Organizations that build on top of existing components assume risk for software they did not create. Vulnerabilities in third-party components are inherited by all applications that use those components. The <a href="OWASP_Top_Ten" title="wikilink">OWASP Top Ten</a> (2013 and 2017) both recognize the risk of <a href="Top_10_2013-A9-Using_Components_with_Known_Vulnerabilities" title="wikilink">using components with known vulnerabilities</a>.</p>
<p>Dependency-Track is a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) platform that keeps track of all third-party components used in all the applications an organization creates or consumes. It integrates with multiple vulnerability databases including the <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/">National Vulnerability Database</a> (NVD), <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/advisories">NPM Public Advisories</a>, <a href="https://ossindex.sonatype.org/">Sonatype OSS Index</a>, and <a href="https://vulndb.cyberriskanalytics.com">VulnDB</a> from <a href="https://www.riskbasedsecurity.com">Risk Based Security</a>. Dependency-Track monitors all applications in its portfolio in order to proactively identify vulnerabilities in components that are placing your applications at risk. Use of Dependency-Track can play a vital role in an overall <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Supply-Chain-Risk-Management">Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management</a> (C-SCRM) program by fulfilling many of the recommendations laid out by <a href="https://www.safecode.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/SAFECode_TPC_Whitepaper.pdf">SAFECode</a>.</p>
<p>Dependency-Track is designed to be used in an automated DevOps environment where BoM (bill-of-material) formats are automatically ingested during CI/CD. Use of the <a href="https://plugins.jenkins.io/dependency-track">Dependency-Track Jenkins Plugin</a> is highly recommended for this purpose and is well suited for use in Jenkins Pipeline. In such an environment, Dependency-Track enables your DevOps teams to accelerate while still keeping tabs on component usage and any inherited risk.</p>
<p>Dependency-Track can also be used to monitor vulnerabilities in COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) software.</p>

# Acknowledgements

This project would not be possible without the existence of the
[OWASP_Dependency_Check](OWASP_Dependency_Check "wikilink") project.
Special thanks to Jeremy Long and the Dependency-Check core team for
their hard work.

## Dependency-Track Core Team

  - [Steve Springett](User:Steve_Springett "wikilink")

## Sponsors

Dependency-Track is created by a worldwide group of volunteers who have
dedicated their time, talent, or provided financial support to the
project.

The project would like to acknowledge and thank the following
organizations that have helped move this project forward

  - [Risk Based Security](https://www.riskbasedsecurity.com/)

OWASP Dependency-Track is an open source project, created by people who
believe that the knowledge of using vulnerable components should be
accessible to anyone with a desire to know. By supporting this project,
you'll allow the team to outsource testing, infrastructure, further
research and development efforts, and engage in outreach to various
communities that would benefit from this technology.

<p>Dependency-Track is an intelligent Software <a href="Component_Analysis" title="wikilink">Supply Chain Component Analysis</a> platform that allows organizations to identify and reduce risk from the use of third-party and open source components. Dependency-Track takes a unique and highly beneficial approach by leveraging the capabilities of Software Bill-of-Materials (SBOM). This approach provides capabilities that traditional Software Composition Analysis (SCA) solutions cannot achieve.</p>
<p>Dependency-Track monitors component usage across all versions of every application in its portfolio in order to proactively identify risk across an organization. The platform has an API-first design and is ideal for use in Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) environments.</p>

# Acknowledgements

This project would not be possible without the existence of the
[OWASP_Dependency_Check](OWASP_Dependency_Check "wikilink") project.
Special thanks to Jeremy Long and the Dependency-Check core team for
their hard work.

## Dependency-Track Core Team

  - [Steve Springett](User:Steve_Springett "wikilink")

## Sponsors

Dependency-Track is created by a worldwide group of volunteers who have
dedicated their time, talent, or provided financial support to the
project.

The project would like to acknowledge and thank the following
organizations that have helped move this project forward

  - [Risk Based Security](https://www.riskbasedsecurity.com/)

OWASP Dependency-Track is an open source project, created by people who
believe that the knowledge of using vulnerable components should be
accessible to anyone with a desire to know. By supporting this project,
you'll allow the team to outsource testing, infrastructure, further
research and development efforts, and engage in outreach to various
communities that would benefit from this technology.

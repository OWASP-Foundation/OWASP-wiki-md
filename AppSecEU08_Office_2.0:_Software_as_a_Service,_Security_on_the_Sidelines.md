## Presentation Abstract

Online office suites have proliferated over the last year, improving
drastically and providing feasible alternatives to traditional desktop
office software in the form of [Google
Docs](http://www.google.com/docs), [ThinkFree](http://www.thinkfree.com)
and [Zoho](http://www.zoho.com). Securing these services presents
interesting challenges: web application vulnerabilities intersect the
world of macro-viruses, 0-day file format flaws and phone home bugs.

This presentation discusses "Office 2.0" threats demonstrating real
world vulnerabilities borne out of the presenter's
[research](http://heasman.blogspot.com). It will cover the following
areas:

  - Assessing the attack surface of online office suites
  - Exploiting the awkward problem of file system access
  - Weaknesses in document collaboration implementations
  - Phone home bugs and advanced document tracking

Though the focus is on online office suites, the concerns raised and
addressed during this session apply equally well to all Web 2.0
applications.

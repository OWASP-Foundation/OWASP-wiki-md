## Key Activities

  - Become intimately familiar with what you are meant to protect and at
    what level.
  - Define processes, procedures, and checklists to align assessment
    strategies to business needs.
  - Effectively communicate the introduction and goals of the

<span id="Asset Discovery"></span>

## Asset Discovery

  - Gather Internal, External and Hosted IP ranges.
  - Catalogue known domains and subdomains.
  - Identify asset meta-data locations. (CMDBs, GRCs, etc.).
  - Identify site owners, where those are not already known.
  - Gather assessment credentials, including multiple roles for
    horizontal and vertical testing.
  - Identify the rate of application change (e.g. monthly, weekly,
    etc.â€¦)

<span id="Asset Risk Prioritization"></span>

## Asset Risk Prioritization

  - Develop or leverage existing methodology for stack ranking the value
    of your assets to the business based on

impact to confidentiality, integrity and availability (C.I.A.). (See:

  - Map asset criticality against attacker profiles with use of a GRC
    (Governance Risk Management and Compliance) tool if available, or
    using an information asset register such as the University of Oxford
    Information Asset Register Tool

For example:

1.  Tier 1 = Targeted Govt./State sponsor.
2.  Tier 2 = Hactivism
3.  Tier 3 = Random Opportunistic

<!-- end list -->

  - Implement ISO 17799: Asset Management or similar standard to improve
    governance of application assets.

<span id="Communication Plan"></span>

## Communication Plan

  - Set expectations of assessment program for all interested parties.
  - Alert Operations team of upcoming activities.
  - Gather written buy-in from application stakeholders for the
    assessment activities.
  - Develop, publish, and maintain comprehensive application security
    and privacy standards, policies, procedures and guidelines and
    enforce these in compliance with relevant global regulations and
    standards.
  - Define, document and share application business continuity and
    incident response plan. (Business Continuity Plan Resources: ITIL,
    COBIT, NIST)

**To be considered a relevant OWASP participant, and, consequently, to
qualify to have the Summit attendance expenses partially paid, you must
belong to one, or more, of the following categories:**

1.  OWASP Summer of Code 2008 project leaders & reviewers,
2.  OWASP Summer of Code 2008 special project contributors,
3.  OWASP Spring of Code 2007 project leaders & reviewers,
4.  OWASP Autumn of Code 2006 project leaders & reviewers,
5.  Active Project Leaders (not currently participating on SoC 08),
6.  Active Chapter Leaders,
7.  Member with significant past OWASP Contribution.

The OWASP Summer of Code 2008 leaders, reviewers and contributors have
also a specific set of rules to abide by. These rules can be seen
[here](OWASP_Summer_of_Code_2008#Updates "wikilink").

Regarding the category 2, up to ten project contributors will be chosen
by OWASP Board having into consideration the supported and detailed
proposals made by the SoC's projects authors.

In addition, regarding the categories between 3 and 4, we will consider
relevant OWASP participant only those who have timely delivered their
projects or have timely performed their reviews.

Regarding the category 5, we will consider relevant OWASP participant
only those with projects in activity and the OWASP Board will judge that
by checking if any significant update on the project page was done in
the last six months.

Regarding the category 6, we will consider relevant OWASP participant
only those with chapters in activity and the OWASP Board will judge that
by checking if any significant activity was done in the last six months.

The last category, the seventh one, was deliberately created to assure
that nobody with relevant past OWASP contributions will be excluded. As
this judgement will be necessarily subjective and casuistic, it will be
OWASP Board's responsibility. However, you can present your application.

In what respects to the level of expenses that will be paid, the
following rules have been established:

1.  With the exceptions below, all accommodation and meal expenses,
    during all the four days, will be paid.
2.  As we are still seeking out for financial sponsorship support, until
    further notice, none of the dinners will be paid.
3.  The meals consist of a pre-negotiated menu and only this one will be
    paid.
4.  The accommodation will consist in a place in a shared T1 (3 people)
    or T2 (5 people) apartment. Therefore, even though one can choose an
    individual room, OWASP will pay only for the cost associated with a
    shared stay. At the cost of +/- 60 Euros per night, there is the
    option to stay in an individual room (or in a double-room, in the
    cases where the partner - wife / husband - is also present).
5.  Please note that the nights of 3 and 7 of Nov will be included in
    the paid accommodation for those of you attending the whole event.
6.  Regarding the flight expenses, OWASP will pay a maximum of 1000 US
    dollars to all non-European attendees and 600 US dollars to the
    European ones.

On the whole, if you accept our challenge to be at the OWASP EU Summit
2008 to present your project and engage the discussion at one, or more,
Working Sessions and if you qualify to have your expenses partially
paid, please contact [Paulo Coimbra](mailto:paulo.coimbra@owasp.org) as
soon as possible.

Nevertheless, although we start with a good budget to cover expenses
(150,000 USD), it will not be enough to cover the current projected
number of OWASP participants. Therefore, if you can convince your
company to pay for some or all of your expenses please do so and, on the
other flip of the coin, we can advertise its logo at the conference
materials - more details about sponsorship opportunities can be seen
[here](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_EU_Summit_2008_Sponsors).

Come and join us\! We are looking forward to seeing you in Portugal\!

The cost of fixing a security bug during coding and testing phases is
known to be much more expensive than at the earlier design stages. This
session will provide product architects and designers with the tools,
methodology and best practices of incorporating security into the design
and architecture stage in a systematic way that would prevent security
design flaws from being introduced in the first place. The session will
cover the threat modeling topic targeting software architecture and
designers. Session outline will include:

  - What is Threat Modeling?
  - Why carry out Threat Modeling?
  - Introducing the Threat Modeling process, covering: System
    decomposition (including DFD) Threat mapping (CIA, STRIDE, Attack
    trees, etc.) Risk rating (several models) Threat response &
    mitigation
  - Best practices in Threat Modeling (covering do's and donâ€™ts, tools,
    tips, etc.)

The session will use a dummy Internet banking system to demonstrate the
various steps in the performance of Threat Modeling.

System architects, designers and key programmers who will attend this
session will:

  - Understand the importance of the Threat Modeling process
  - Get initial tools and methodologies to start performing Threat
    Modeling / security design reviews in their own systems / products
  - Be exposed to industry BKM / best practices in Threat Modeling /
    security design reviews

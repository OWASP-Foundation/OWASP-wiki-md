## The concept

The OWASP Board has decided to start off the process of designing and
building a new concept that will be closely linked to the training
activities promoted by OWASP and that intends to take this area one step
further.

The idea is to create the **OWASP Academies** â€“ a frame under which work
should be done with Universities, Polytechnic Institutes, IT Schools and
other Academic institutions with a view to establish solid relationships
and develop with these organisms ways to collaborate and participate in
the design of courses focused on web application security.

**OWASP has the knowledge and critical mass to give an invaluable input
to any Academy focusing on this area** by:
\* contributing with its expertise in the definition of curricula and
course contents that explore and study the web security field;

  - making available to the Academy its pool of interested and willing
    security experts as trainers.

As mentioned above, this concept is just at its beginning and we do not
have, as of yet, a clear methodology or set of rules to implement what
hopefully will be a new area of work for OWASP.

What is clear, however, is that **to make this happen we will need your
input and ideas, your energy and your initiative\!** Moreover, as we are
planning to **include this discussion in one of the Working Sessions to
be held in the upcoming OWASP Summit 2011**, this would be the **perfect
timing to gather your input and contributions**.

Being so, **if you have contacts within your local academic communities
and would like to be involved in the design and development of this
concept, please do get back to me with your thoughts\!**

I am looking forward to hearing from you\!

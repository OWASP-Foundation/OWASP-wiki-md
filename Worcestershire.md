We would like to welcome everyone in the local community interested in
furthering the Security Community that's already well established to
come along and join a meet up, or contribute to one of our Projects /
CTF's - or even just give your opinion on what can be done better or
contribute ideas.

No knowledge is required, no idea is stupid and a community unafraid to
share openly is our goal.

Everyone is welcome to join us at our chapter meetings.

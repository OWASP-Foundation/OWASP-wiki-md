##### Training Concept

We are proposing a Chapters driven model with local Chapter organization
in which the courses are free for OWASP members, the contents are OWASP
projects focused and the costs are supported by a mix of funding i.e.
local chapter budget, external sponsorship, trainers sponsorship i.e.
trip and/or accommodation paid by themselves and local chapter membersâ€™
sponsorship i.e. taking trainers in as guests.

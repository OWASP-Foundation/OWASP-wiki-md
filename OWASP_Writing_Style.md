1.  **Cite your sources**. The reader needs to be assured that the
    material within it is reliable. This will improve the credibility of
    OWASP, avoid claims of
    [plagiarism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarism), ensure that
    the content of articles can be checked by any reader and help users
    find additional information on the topic. You can see
    [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources#How_to_cite_sources)
    how to cite. Plagiarism is representing another person's work as
    one's own. According to [Diana Hacker](http://www.dianahacker.com/),
    "Three acts are plagiarism: (1) failing to cite quotations and
    borrowed ideas, (2) failing to enclose borrowed language in
    quotation marks and (3) failing to put summaries and paraphrases in
    your own words." Plagiarism is inconsistent with OWASP's goals and
    will result in permanent removal of your material from our site. You
    can use [this simple tool](http://www.articlechecker.com/) to find
    plagiarism practices. Please report suspected plagiarism to
    <owasp@owasp.org> with as many details as possible.
2.  **Use active rather than passive tenses**. It is better to say ‘You
    should see a flashing cursor at the top left of the screen’ rather
    than ‘A flashing cursor should appear at the top left of the
    screen’.
3.  **Use grammatically correct constructs and correct spelling**. To
    boldly go on splitting infinitives (like this) and to misspell words
    (like mispell) irritates many readers and reduces the credibility of
    the writer in their eyes. Unfortunately, English spelling is not
    standardized and both British and American readers are sometimes
    irrational in their dislike of alternative spellings.
4.  **Do not use long sentences which present several different facts**.
    It is better to use a number of shorter sentences. Each sentence can
    then be assimilated on its own. The reader does not need to maintain
    several pieces of information at one time to understand the complete
    sentence.
5.  **Keep paragraphs short**. As a general rule, no paragraph should be
    made up of more than seven sentences. Our capacity for holding
    immediate information is limited. In short paragraphs, all of the
    concepts in the paragraph can be maintained in our short-term memory
    which can hold about 7 chunks of information.
6.  **Don’t be verbose**. If you can say something in a few words do so.
    A lengthy description is not necessarily more profound. Quality is
    more important than quantity.
7.  **Be precise and define the terms which you use**. Computing
    terminology is fluid and many terms have more than one meaning. If
    you use terms like module or process make sure that your definition
    is clear. Collect definitions in a glossary.
8.  **If a description is complex, repeat yourself**. It is often a good
    idea to present two or more differently phrased descriptions of the
    same thing. If readers fail to completely understand one
    description, they may benefit from having the same thing said in a
    different way.
9.  **Make use of headings and sub-headings**. These break up a chapter
    into parts which may be read separately. Always ensure that a
    consistent numbering convention is used.
10. **Itemize facts wherever possible**. It is usually clearer to
    present facts in a list rather than in a sentence. Use textual
    highlighting (italics or underlining) for emphasis.
11. **Do not refer to information by reference number alone**. Give the
    reference number and remind the reader what that reference covered.
    For example, rather than say ‘In section 1.3 …’ you should say ‘In
    section 1.3, which described management process models, …’.

  - Documents should be inspected in the same way as programs. During a
    document inspection, the text is criticized, omissions pointed out
    and suggestions made on how to improve the document. In this latter
    respect, it differs from a code inspection which is an error finding
    rather than an error correction mechanism. As well as personal
    criticism, you can also use grammar checkers which are incorporated
    in word processors. These checkers find ungrammatical or clumsy uses
    of words. They identify long sentences and paragraphs and the use of
    passive rather than active tenses. These checkers are not perfect
    and sometimes they use outmoded style rules or rules which are
    specific to one country. Nevertheless, because they often check
    style as you are typing, they can help identify phrases which could
    be improved.
  - Standards and quality assessment are essential if good documentation
    is to be produced but document quality is fundamentally dependent on
    the writer’s ability to construct clear and concise technical prose.
    In short, good documentation requires good writing.
  - Writing documents well is neither easy nor is it a single stage
    process. Written work must be written, read, criticized and then
    rewritten until a satisfactory document is produced. Technical
    writing is a craft rather than a science but some broad guide-lines
    about how to write well can be found above.

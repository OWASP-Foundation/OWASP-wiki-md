On behalf of the OWASP Foundation, I would like to extend an invitation
to you to attend the 2011 OWASP Global Summit.

OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) is a not-for-profit
Foundation whose mission is to make application security visible, so
that people and organizations can make informed decisions about true
application security risks. Everyone is free to participate in OWASP and
all of our materials are available under a free and open source software
license [OWASP MAIN PAGE](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page)

We are currently organizing our global strategic meeting - the OWASP
Summit 2011 - and intend to make this event the place where application
security experts meet to discuss plans, projects and solutions for the
future of application security. This Summit, that will take place near
Lisbon, in Portugal, on 8-11 February, and will consist of a series of
working sessions across a variety of topics set by a diversity of
leaders and experts in the industry and our community.

We would really be delighted to have you there. Information on the
working sessions, confirmed attendees, tickets, and accommodations can
be found [on the Summit

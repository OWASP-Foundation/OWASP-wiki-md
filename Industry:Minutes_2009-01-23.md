## Discussions, Actions and Results

### Committee Plan

The Industry Committee wants to establish contacts with proper people in
right places. These may be in industry, government, academia and
regulatory organisations - we will need to liaise with the other
committees, for example on the [Global Education
Committee](Global_Education_Committee "wikilink")'s work with
universities. We need to identify areas where we can make a difference.
Once we have identified potential organisations/contacts, we need to
rank these by potential to prioritize and then get other people to help
us. Our plan needs to include pro-active work as well as be able to
respond reactively to situations as they develop.

The draft plan was created on the [Global Industry
Committee](Global_Industry_Committee "wikilink") page during the
meeting.

Actions and results:

  - Create draft plan (DC) *Completed during meeting*
  - Add deadlines and finalise committee plan (DC)

### Outreach

Work in progress and completed items have been added to the [Global
Industry Committee](Global_Industry_Committee "wikilink").

Anything that is to be submitted as an official OWASP response/comment
should be reviewed and approved by a majority of the Industry Committee.
More sensitive issues may need approval by the OWASP Board.

Actions and results:

  - Add infragard presentation to 'completed items' (DC) *Completed

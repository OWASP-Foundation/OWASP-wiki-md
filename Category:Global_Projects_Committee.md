# About the Global Projects Committee (GPC)

The GPC was created during the OWASP EU Summit in Portugal in 11/2008.

The purpose of the OWASP Global Projects Committee (GPC) is to foster an
active OWASP developer community, facilitate contributions from OWASP
community members, provide support and direction for new projects, and
encourage adoption of OWASP Projects by the global community at large.

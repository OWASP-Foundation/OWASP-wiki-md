"Owasp_logo_normal.jpg")Application security is an evolving field, and
one that gets more complex each day as the threats and challenges
increase. By integrating traditional process-improvement methods with
application security considerations, rather than viewing application
security as an afterthought, organizations establish the foundation to
deliver security continuously throughout the lifecycle. This
presentation will highlight the positive impact that OWASP efforts have
had on the SwA Processes and Practices Working Group efforts to increase
the adoption of application security practices through the use of
people, process, and technology.

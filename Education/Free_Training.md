The following courses either have been offered or are being offered free
of charge courtesy of the trainers and the OWASP Foundation to anyone
interested in learning about application security. Additionally, the
training slides/coursework is available under an open source license and
we encourage you to use it to set up your own training event\!

  - NEW\* 11-April 2016, OWASP is experimenting with GOTOTraining as a
    platform to enable project leaders to provide training on their
    project to the world. For more information [CLICK
    HERE](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Education/Virtual_Classroom)

If you are interested in setting up a training event through OWASP,
[submit your request here](http://www.tfaforms.com/301382), we also have
funding available to community members who may need help with travel, a
venue or other logistics to get the event up and running. [Click here
for more information.](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Funding)

Here are some general guidelines we have set up for free training
courses within the OWASP Community:

1.  Use free and local when possible - donated venues or universities as
    well as trainers that are near by will help save on overhead costs
2.  Use open source training materials - we ask that you make your
    training materials available after the course, preferably in an
    editable format
3.  Use [OWASP
    template](https://www.owasp.org/images/5/5d/PPT_2013_Toolbox.zip)
    for slides and keep any company branding to one bio slide
4.  Do an open call for training when possible to avoid giving
    preference to any one vendor/trainer and give others in the
    community a chance to participate
5.  If possible, do the training in a way and time that doesn't compete
    with paid training (especially at Global AppSec Conferences)

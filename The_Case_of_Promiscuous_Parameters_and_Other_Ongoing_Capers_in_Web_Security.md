"Owasp_logo_normal.jpg")ecurity is harder than it looks: seemingly
innocuous programming constructs can turn a cool project into a time
bomb. The prevalence of “safe” languages like Java and C\# combined with
an ever-increasing number of abstraction layers are making
vulnerabilities like buffer overflow and SQL injection things of the
past. But is security on the Web getting better universally? This talk
takes a deep-dive into modern web programming paradigms and frameworks,
including ASP.NET, Spring and Struts, to demonstrate security
anti-patterns that every developer on the Web needs to grok.

## The speaker

Jacob West is Director of Security Research at Fortify Software where
his team is responsible for building security knowledge into Fortify's
products. Jacob brings expertise in numerous programming languages,
frameworks and styles together with knowledge about how real-world
systems can fail. Before joining Fortify, Jacob contributed to the
development of MOPS, a static analysis tool used to discover security
vulnerabilities in C programs. In 2007, he co-authored a book with
colleague Brian Chess titled "Secure Programming with Static Analysis".
When he is away from the keyboard, Jacob spends time speaking at
conferences and working with customers to advance their understanding of
software security.

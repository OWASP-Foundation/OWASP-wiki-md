## Overview

Welcome to the OWASP Interceptor Project for XML Processing. The
Interceptor tool is designed to easily assist security testers in
performing attacks against XML Web Services and AJAX interfaces. The
utility allows testers to capture a sample XML request and then
replay/fuzz requests against the Web Service.

A tester can also preload an automated attack database for each request
into the tool, and Interceptor will fuzz and replay each attack against
the service and provide results.

**The Welcome Screen (And Interface) of the Interceptor Project.**

## Goals

The Goal of this project was to develop a simple, quick and easy to use
tool that could capture and save XML requests and then allow testers to
easily replay the request with fuzzed data. Thus allowing the quick
testing of the XML Web Service interfaces without the need to use TCP
request processors or additional proxies to manipulate and replay
handcrafted attack data.

  -   - Please help with this project. We would like to be able to
        create a "GENERIC" XML attack list of common types of XML
        attacks that can be configured as a pre-loaded attack database
        in Interceptor. Contact the Project Team with any ideas.

## Download

Interceptor 0.9 BETA is currently available for download from

the binaries and associated Libraries to run on Windows. The utility
requires the system to have an installed version of the Microsoft .NET
Framework 2.0 installed.

This is the Request Screen for the Interface. From here you can easily
capture and save XML requests from clients and web browsers.

The XML Attack screen allows testers to load preconfigured attack logic
into the tool and then request the utility to perform an automated
attack based on the database signatures.

## Future Development

OK, After a while of not much developer, interceptor is back into full
swing. Thanks to some new team members with b-sec, we are now developing
a release which can be treated as 1.0 and will run on all the latest
versions of windows etc (including VISTA). If you have anything you want
us to add or change let us know.

## News

June-July 2007, Work on Version 1.0 is happening and the next release
will come up within a month. This will fix the VISTA problems etc.

22nd November 2006 - Interceptor 0.9 BETA Released on OWASP Web Site.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><strong>ASIDE</strong> is an abbreviation for <strong>Application Security plugin for Integrated Development Environment</strong>. It is an Eclipse Plugin which is a software tool primarily designed to help developers write more secure code by detecting and identifying potentially vulnerable code and providing informative fixes during the construction of programs in IDEs.</p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>ASIDE currently has three prototype implementations: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjzlpccMjTM">ASIDE CodeRefactoring for Education</a>, ASIDE CodeAnnotate which consists of two implementations, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyAO8WztiMc">ASIDE JavaCodeAnnotate</a> and ASIDE PHPCodeAnnotate.</p>
<p>ASIDE CodeRefactoring for Education is an Eclipse plugin that aims to detect root cause of vulnerabilities that are caused by untrusted inputs get in to the application and be consumed without validation, and provide interactive code refactoring support for students and professional developers to learn secure programming practices and write more secure code.</p>
<p>ASIDE CodeAnnotate is another Eclipse plugin which deals with a different class of vulnerabilities that are more application logic specific. Specifically, it is aimed at addressing CSRF and broken access control issues while the developers are writing their code.</p>
<p>An older version of <a href="http://webpages.uncc.edu/~jxie2/aside_old.swf">ASIDE DEMO</a> shows you earlier design and implementation of CodeRefactoring, if you are interested in knowing. You will need Adobe Flash to display it.</p>

# RoadMap and Get Involvement

ASIDE project has been continuously under active research, development,
and evaluation. Involvement in the development and promotion of ASIDE is
actively encouraged\! You do not have to be a security expert in order
to contribute. Some of the ways you can help:

  - Try ASIDE and email your feedback, comments to the project leaders.
  - Do pilot study with ASIDE in your team, and the project leaders
    would love to collaborate\!

# Education branch of ASIDE: ESIDE

## ESIDE

The education branch of ASIDE, named ESIDE (Educational Security in the
IDE), is led by [Michael
Whitney](http://hci.uncc.edu/tomcat/Michael_Whitney/) and [Heather
Richter Lipford](http://hci.uncc.edu/~richter). Other major contributors
include [Bill Chu](User:_Bill_Chu "wikilink") and [Jun
Zhu](http://www.linkedin.com/in/junzhu1).

## Introduction

ESIDE (Educational Security in the IDE) enhances the secure coding
instructional process by turning the student's IDE into a real-time
secure programming instructional resource. This approach capitalizes on
the out of class, in the IDE time by providing layered educational
opportunities whenever the student writes specific code patterns (i.e.,
vulnerable code) in a fashion similar to Microsoft's Grammar Checker. In
this manner, ESIDE provides students with the opportunity to learn
secure coding principles and practices concurrently with the lessons
they are learning in their respective courses.

## Description

Deployed as an Eclipse IDE Java plugin, ESIDE continuously searches for
predetermined code patterns (e.g., request.getParameter();). Whenever a
student writes targeted code, they are provided with an interactive
system that provides a layered educational opportunity. Because students
are contextually “in the moment” when the support becomes available,
they are more receptive to making the connection between classroom
principles and coding practices. A secondary effect is the exponential
increase in instructional exposure which has been proven to be
successful in other instructional areas. The overall goal of ESIDE is to
serve as an effective means to educate students at every level on the
principles and practices of secure coding throughout their educational
experience. To this end, we have developed ESIDE's interactive process
as follows: The moment target code is written, ESIDE initiates a layered
educational intervention based on the targeted code. The first layer is
a warning icon that is placed in the left margin of the code editor.
Hovering the icon reveals a short message that encourages further
interaction. When the student clicks the icon, ESIDE generates a content
specific list of educational options. Each of these options are
accompanied with a short explanation of the issue at hand. For each
generated list, there also exists the option to access an explanation
page that provides a more comprehensive explanation of what was
discovered, why it is important, and how to integrate the provided
principles into coding practices.

A video of an interaction designed for early students can be found at
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-FIcrr1ff8>

## What ESIDE provides?

• Real-time IDE support for secure code education (Java).

• Identification of targeted Java code patterns.

• Interactive instructional opportunities for students in the IDE.

## Runnable ESIDE Prototype and Installation Guidelines

The recent publicly available ESIDE plugin can be downloaded from
[here](http://webpages.uncc.edu/~jzhu16/edu.uncc.sis.aside_1.0.0.201302251700.jar).
You also need to download the complementary
[logging](http://webpages.uncc.edu/~jzhu16/edu.uncc.sis.aside.logging_1.0.0.201302251700.jar)
facility to make ESIDE work properly. ESIDE is built upon [Eclipse IDE
for Java EE
Developers](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/indigosr1)
Version 3.5+. To make it work, please place the two jar files under the
plugins folder of your Eclipse installation directory and then restart
your Eclipse.

## Open Source Code

The most recent source code of ESIDE can be accessed via
<https://github.com/witny23/ESIDE>.

## Priorities and get involved

As of March 17, 2015 the priorities are:

1\. Move xml into a database.

2\. Create a public repository of customized ESIDE support for specific
courses.

Involvement in the development and promotion of ESIDE is actively
encouraged\! You do not have to be a security expert in order to
contribute. Some of the ways you can help: Individuals who are
interested in content contribution, usability evaluation or deploying
ESIDE in their classroom would be wonderful\!\!

  - In July 2011, we released version 0.94 as the first "real" release
    (not a release candidate).
  - We plan to have a 1.0 release at the OWASP North America conference
    in September 2011.
  - After the 1.0 release, we plan to focus on gathering information
    about vulnerabilities in the 1.0 VM.

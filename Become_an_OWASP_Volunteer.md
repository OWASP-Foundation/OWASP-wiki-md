## Who Can Help

Anyone can help OWASP simply by finding tasks that need to be completed
and taking them on. Some tasks require a great deal of technical
expertise, while others are fine for those who are looking to help but
aren't yet confident in their application security skills.

## How to Get Started

In order to edit the materials at OWASP, you'll need to create an
account. Then you'll need to find some tasks that need to be completed.

1.  You can start by looking at some
    [projects](:Category:OWASP_Project "wikilink") that you're
    interested in to see if there are any open tasks.
2.  You can also check the [OWASP front page](Main_Page "wikilink") for
    any critical tasks.
3.  To browse the full list of tasks, you can look for
    [stubs](:Category:Stub "wikilink") of articles that need to be
    completed.

## Working with Others

There are three main ways to interact with other folks at OWASP.

1.  The first is to use the "discussion" pages associated with each
    OWASP article. Please use these pages to discuss approaches and
    document decisions.
2.  You can also use the mailing lists for each project to communicate
    with a list of people interested in a particular project
3.  Lastly, you can use the forums (coming soon) to discuss issues
    related to OWASP and application security.

  - **Dec 10 - [SANS and OWASP Partner to Add \#1 Web Application
    Security to SANS Top 20](http://www.sans.org/top20/?ref=1697#c1)**
    The SANS document is widely used, and we're extremely pleased that
    we could work with them to recognize the risks associated with web
    applications. From the document... "Every week hundreds of
    vulnerabilities are being reported in these web applications, and
    are being actively exploited. The number of attempted attacks every
    day for some of the large web hosting farms range from hundreds of
    thousands to even millions. All web frameworks (PHP, .NET, J2EE,
    Ruby on Rails, ColdFusion, Perl, etc) and all types of web
    applications are at risk from web application security defects,
    ranging from insufficient validation through to application logic
    errors."

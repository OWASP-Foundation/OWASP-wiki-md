### Topic: Hands on, AppSec Capture the Flag\!

The Denver OWASP chapter is pleased to present the [CTF from the New
York Appsec 2008
conference](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_NYC_AppSec_2008_Conference/ctf).
The CTF is a series of 30 or so "challenges" which demonstrate commonly
found software vulnerabilities.

The purpose of the CTF is twofold. Advanced users can test their AppSec
acumen by tackling the challenges on their own. Beginning users can
learn AppSec fundamentals as they are guided through the challenges by
the friendly chapter leaders and advanced users.

Whilst seemingly technical in nature, the CTF will also be of interest
to managers, developers and executives, as it provides a simple way to
demonstrate and communicate the serious impact of many AppSec
vulnerabilities.

### Agenda

  - 6pm: Pizza & pop @ RPSC, courtesy of
    [DirSec](http://www.dirsec.com/)
  - 6:30pm: Introduction and Chapter business
  - 6:45pm --\> 8pm: CTF

### Logistics

In order to participate in the CTF "hands on" you will need to bring a
wifi equipped laptop. Many of the challenges in the CTF can be solved
without any special tools. However, for those challenges that require
tools, we recommend the [OWASP
LiveCD](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Live_CD_2008_Project).
Go ahead and download it and familiarize yourself with it ahead of time,
if you're so inclined. We will have LiveCD copies on hand at the meeting
also.

### Prizes

We are working with DirSec to coordinate prizes for both the first place
advanced user as well as the "most improved" novice user.

<!-- end list -->

  - Membership Kits
      - Agreed that membership kits would be modified as follows to
        minimize cost
          - Memberhip kit will only contain an OWASP T-Shirt
          - An electronic copy of the membership card and certificate
            will be e-mail'ed to the member
          - For memberships created as a result of conference
            registration the user will receive their t-shirt at the
            conference. This will minimize the shipping costs for our
            international members.
          - The other items of the membership kit will be eliminated
            (printed badge, badge holder, sticker)
      - Savings: $4.34 per kit --\> 22% savings for domestic membership
        kits and 16% savings for international kits
      - Additional Savings: Possibly reduces Kate's time and
        significantly reduces international shipping costs (for
        conference originated membership)

<!-- end list -->

  - Creation of Organizational Supporter Kits
      - Purpose: To provide regular information to organizational
        supporters regarding OWASP
      - Each organizational supporter will receive an OWASP kit each
        quarter
      - Contents
          - 2 copies of an OWASP book printed from lulu (OWASP Top 10 is
            first book)
          - 1 glossy printout of most recent OWASP newsletter
      - **ACTION ITEM: KATE** - We need to determine an estimated cost
        for this and check we have mailing addresses for all
        organizational members

<!-- end list -->

  - Organizational Supporter Contact
      - Purpose: To establish regular communication between OWASP and
        organizational supporters
      - All of the organizational supporters will be logically divided
        by region or established contacts between the OWASP membership
        committee and OWASP board members (as needed).
      - Each quarter the OWASP contact point will call and speak with
        the organizational supporter contact point
      - Goal:
          - Establish and build relationship with OWASP
          - Ensure supporter is aware of local chapter events
          - Discuss how OWASP and supporter can further work together
      - **ACTION ITEM: MICHAEL** - Build list and perform first pass of
        division

<!-- end list -->

  - Organizational GOLD Supporter / Bundle
      - Discussing idea of creating a bundled supporter package.
      - Goal is to allow an org to use a single PO for the entire year
        for multiple OWASP "purchases"
      - Ideas for bundle include:
          - Organizational Supporter
          - Conference Attendance
          - Banner Ads
          - Conference Sponsorships
          - Local Chapter donations
      - Need to determine what % discount
      - Need to create sample bundles and possibly offer ala carte style
        bundling

<!-- end list -->

  - OWASP Presence at Conferences
      - Is OWASP visible at big security conferences? (BlacHat, HitB,
        CanSecWest, etc)
      - What about developer conferences?
      - Seba proposed OWASP contact conference organizers to establish
        official relationship. This is something connections committee
        is likely handling.
      - **ACTION ITEM: SEBA** - Follow up with connection committee to
        see if they are doing this

<td><h2 id="the_owasp_robotic_security_principles">The OWASP Robotic Security Principles</h2>
<p>The OWASP Robotic Security Project has the following principles:</p>
<p><em>I, Guy Huntington, have listed these principles below to get the discussion going. They aren't yet written in stone!</em></p>
<p><strong>Identification:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Each robot created, virtual or physical, will have a unique "Robot Identification Unit" (RIU)</li>
<li>The RIU will be unique to the robot from any other robot created in the past, present or future</li>
<li>Each RIU used will be instantly, globally checked to confirm its unique identity or, be issued by a recognized RIU issuing authority which can confirm its global uniqueness</li>
<li>The RIU must be able to show the robot is a robot</li>
<li>RIU's should be able to allow the robot to act anonymously, i.e. show the robot is registered but not reveal more details about the robot unless legal consent from its creator/owner is obtained</li>
<li>The RIU code repository will be secure</li>
<li>It won't allow for others to obtain the RIU and then masquerade as another or, allow a different RIU to be inserted into it to portray itself as another</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Registration:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Each robot created should be registered with a new age civil registration service</li>
<li>The process of creating a registered robot identity MUST be highly automated</li>
<li>The registration process must involve confirmation the robot identity being registered doesn't already exist in some other new age civil registration service on the planet</li>
<li>If the robotic registration process involves creation of a unique registered robotic identifier, then this must be securely passed back to the robotic creator/owner and then inserted into the RIU</li>
<li>Registration processes used by new age civil registration services MUST be the same to avoid potential robotic identity collisions as well as to easily provide global robotic registration from the local new age civil registration service</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Change of Registration:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Any change of registration must follow globally accepted business and technical processes</li>
<li>A robot's RIU CANNOT be changed unless under specific legal direction using globally accepted legal, business and technical processes as set forth in laws and regulations</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Robotic Termination:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Robotic termination should follow global laws and regulations pertaining to the termination of a robot</li>
<li>All robotic terminations should be registered with the local new age civil registration service</li>
<li>A robot who's created in Jurisdiction X that's terminated in Jurisdiction Y should have Jurisdiction Y doing a global search for the robot, determining it was created in Jurisdiction X and then automatically notifying Jurisdiction X of the termination</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Robot Security Principles:</strong></p>
<p>We need to insert here a detailed list of other robot security principles. These should detail out virtual and physical security principles for robots. The project must also address robots acting together in singularity.    </p>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>The OWASP Robotic Security Project is meant to create bottom up driven robot security standards applied globally. It includes robot identification, registration, change of registration, robot termination (and other robot security - we need to flesh this out).</p>
<p>With the advent of both virtual and physical robots, the number being created will shortly grow from millions to billions. They can and will easily cross existing nation state borders. The robots' actions will have legal implications ranging from contracts and operations through to personal interactions with people and/or other robots. This results in potential civil and criminal liabilities. Thus there is a need to legally register the identities of the robots, in a manner such that all jurisdictions are involved.</p>
<p>The potential aspect of malicious people, organizations or states taking advantage of a robot must be addressed. This ranges from identity, consent, data to potential operation of the robot. It also must include cloud based security for the robot. Thus, global security best practices need to be developed regarding robotic security.</p>
<p>This project is results driven. Thus, it starts with robot creation through to termination, generating practical code and business practice security which industry can readily adopt with new laws and regulations referencing them.</p>
<p>Since technology changes very quickly, the security principles and best practices also needs to be designed to rapidly change. Thus, the robot security project is creating a framework with which to then rapidly change as and when required.</p>
<p><strong>We invite interested parties to join us!</strong></p>

# FAQs

`   TBD`</span>

## How can I participate in your project?

All you have to do is make the Project Leader's aware of your available
time to contribute to the project. It is also important to let the
Leader's know how you would like to contribute and pitch in to help the
project meet it's goals and milestones. There are many different ways
you can contribute to an OWASP Project, but communication with the leads
is key.

## If I am not a programmer can I participate in your project?

Yes, you can certainly participate in the project if you are not a
programmer or technical. The project needs different skills and
expertise and different times during its development. Currently, beyond
the programmer, technical and security folks we are looking for people
with skills sets in legal, government and privacy.

## Result

ICO summary of responses at
<http://www.ico.gov.uk/upload/documents/library/data_protection/practical_application/personal_information_online_cop_consultation_summary.pdf>

OWASP listed as written responder in above document.

Final document expected July 2010, with separate guidance on security to
follow.

## Submission Response (final)

### Section 7 - Data protection online

#### Question 3 (Are there any other specific issues relating to online security that you think it would be helpful for us to cover in the code?)

We recommend adding the following points:

  - Ensure that a Secure Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is in place.
  - During the analysis phase of the project, perform a threat analysis
    (or similar) to help determine the security requirements that must
    be met. The security requirements should cover the following types
    of issue:
      - Security architecture
      - Authentication
      - Session management
      - Access control
      - Input validation
      - Output encoding/escaping
      - Cryptography
      - Error handling and logging
      - Data protection
      - Communication security
      - HTTP security
      - Security configuration
      - Malicious code search
  - Secure coding practices should be in place during the development
    phase. These should reflect common risks such as those described in
    the OWASP Top Ten.
  - The testing phase should include an element of application security
    testing.
  - During the deployment phase the emphasis should be on security
    hardening of the application, database and infrastructure.

### Section 10 - Operating internationally

#### Question 7 (Are there any other international issues you would like to see covered?)

The two sections boxed out with bullet point apply equally to design
agencies, website developers, web programmers, contractors, hosting
companies and other suppliers located in the UK - not just
internationally.

We recommend adding the following points:

  - have a risk-based application security programme built into all
    stages of software (e.g. website) development practices
  - ensure all websites and related systems are developed securely to
    protect against security risks
  - build information security and privacy requirements into all
    contracts and agreements

### Section 12 - General consultation questions

#### Question 16 (Is there any other relevant guidance that we should refer to?)

We recommend referencing the following OWASP documents relating to the
development of secure websites and web services (web applications).
These are all available free of charge on OWASP's wiki and as PDFs, or
at cost from an online printer. OWASP does not endorse commercial
products or services.

  - Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM)
    An open framework to help organisations formulate and implement a
    strategy for software security that is tailored to the specific
    risks facing the organization.
    <http://www.opensamm.org/>

<!-- end list -->

  - Top Ten, OWASP
    The OWASP Top Ten represents a broad consensus about what the most
    critical web application security flaws are.

  - Guide to Building Secure Web Applications, OWASP
    The Development Guide is aimed at architects, developers,
    consultants and auditors and is a comprehensive manual for
    designing, developing and deploying secure Web Applications and Web
    Services.
    <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Guide_Project>

<!-- end list -->

  - Code Review Guide, OWASP
    Guidance on identifying security flaws in web application source
    code.
    <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Code_Review_Project>

<!-- end list -->

  - Testing Guide, OWASP
    Web application security penetration testing guide describing
    techniques for testing the most common web application and web
    service security issues.
    <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Testing_Project>

<!-- end list -->

  - Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS), OWASP
    Structured security verification framework for web applications.
    <http://www.owasp.org/index.php/ASVS>

#### Question 17 (Are there any further comments you wish to make?)

Response to the ICO on behalf of OWASP

-----

  - The following text does not form part of OWASP's submission, but
    explains our background and therefore the context of our input.

This is an official response on behalf of the Open Web Application
Security Project (OWASP)\[1\] prepared by UK members of OWASP's Global
Industry Committee\[2\] in consultation with participants in the
Leeds\[3\], London\[4\] and Scotland\[5\] chapters.

OWASP is pleased the ICO is providing guidance in this manner to UK
organisations.

About OWASP

-----

OWASP is a global open community dedicated to enabling organizations to
develop, purchase, and maintain applications that can be trusted. OWASP
builds documents, tools, teaching environments, guidelines, checklists,
and other materials to help organisations improve their capability to
produce secure code. All of the OWASP tools, documents, forums, and
chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application
security.

OWASP was formed in 2001, in an entirely organic fashion, when a group
of security professionals came to realise how terribly insecure the way
we develop our web applications was. The initial goal was deemed to be
modest: write a guide for developers, which would document secure
software development practices. While the initial effort was meant to
last a few weeks, it came out to several hundred pages. When released,
the OWASP Guide to Building Secure Web Applications was an instant
success.

OWASP is a place where good people gather to help increase the awareness
of the web application security problems in applications. It is a
grass-roots effort, with the driving force being the people who are
dealing with these problems every day, and wanting to lend a hand to
change the situation for the better. The OWASP Foundation is a
not-for-profit entity that ensures the project's long-term success and
has over 130 local chapters around the world including three in the UK.

OWASP's projects are widely referenced\[6\] by national & international
legislation, standards, guidelines, committees and industry codes of
practice. For example, the OWASP Guide to Building Secure Web
Applications\[7\] and OWASP Top Ten\[8\] are referred to in the Payment
Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)\[9\]. OWASP was
shortlisted last year for the best security initiative award in
Nominet's Best Practice Challenge\[10\].

OWASP has previously provided responses to DPC BS 8878:2009 on Web
Accessibility, the Digital Britain Interim Report, DPC BS 10012, and
many draft international standards and guides\[11\] relating to web
application security.

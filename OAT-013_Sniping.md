### Description

The defining characteristic of Sniping is an action undertaken at the
latest opportunity to achieve a particular objective, leaving
insufficient time for another user to bid/offer. Sniping can also be the
automated exploitation of system latencies in the form of timing
attacks. Careful timing and prompt action are necessary parts. It is
most well known as auction sniping, but the same threat event can be
used in other types of applications. Sniping normally leads to some
disbenefit for other users, and sometimes that might be considered a
form of denial of service.

In contrast, [OAT-005 Scalping](OAT-005_Scalping "wikilink") is the
acquisition of limited availability of sought-a er goods or services,
and [OAT-006 Expediting](OAT-006_Expediting "wikilink") is the general
hastening of progress.

### Other Names and Examples

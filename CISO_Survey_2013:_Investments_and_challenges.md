# 2\. Investments and challenges

## Increase of investments in Application Security

With regards to these risks and in general, application security
investments are overall increasing for the next year, while the majority
of budgets for infrastructure security will remain roughly the same.

## Advantages of a two year application security strategy for budget allocations

We also further analyzed the data for correlations of investments with a
variety of factors, like whether an organization had a recent security
breach, has an ASMS, company size, type of role of the submitting person
(i.e. CISO), whether the organization has a security strategy, and the
time horizon of the security strategy. So far we only found a
significant correlation with the existence of 2-year security
strategies. Other factors did not show a significant correlation, which
can to some degree be due to the fact that the data set might not be
large enough to prove other relationships.

Although of course correlation is not a proof for causality, it appears
that there is a sweet spot of a 2-year security strategy that can help
in budget decisions increasing investments in security. Other timespans
did not show a significant improvement. Reasons behind this might be
that a 2-year security strategy gives enough planning time to allocate
security investments budgets into the following year, even if the budget
for the current year is already exhausted. It may also give an advantage
in the budget planning process to look beyond the annual budget plans.
(More details about security strategies in the last section “Governance
and Controls” and in part III of the OWASP CISO guide.)

We also wanted to analyze the influence of a previous data breach on new
security investments. So far there have been frequent anecdotal reports
that a recent breach can increase the motivation and chances of an
organization to invest more in security. So we asked the CISOs about
whether their organization would be spending more on application
security in response to a breach or security incident related to a web
application?

Nearly seventy percent stated that a recent breach would not influence
their future spending in security. Interestingly this picture changes
when you look at only the sub-group of companies who recently had an
incident. There, more than half stated that they would increase spending
on application security after an incident. Maybe going through the
experience recently made them more aware for the potential turmoil and
damages resulting from such breaches with the consequence of increased
spending to not “get burned again”. And vice versa, this could be an
indication that companies who didn’t recently suffer from a breach or an
incident (or are not aware of it) might in fact be underinvesting in
application security as they are underestimating the potential damages
from such a security incident. It might also be an indication for a lack
of proactive risk management strategy of some organizations when
budgeting for the security of applications. As when the focus is on
tactical risk management, a security incident may still trigger an
increase in spending in application security even if is not considered a
factor in the budgeting for a one or two year strategy.

## The Top five application security priorities for the coming 12 months

After looking at the trends of application security investment, we
analyzed deeper which specific areas CISOs identified as their Top-5
priorities for 2014. And we received as a clear Top priority the
improvement of security awareness and training for developers, which
corresponds well to counter the most important security risk as seen by
CISOs, the lack of awareness of application security issues within the
organization. In line with these CISO priorities, OWASP will focus
especially on this and has defined the improvement of security trainings
as one of our key strategic goals for 2014.

## Biggest challenges to effectively delivering your organization's application security initiatives

Interestingly the top challenge for CISOs is not acquiring adequate
budget, but finding the right qualified resources and achieving
awareness across the organization, be it among the developers who build
new applications or the management team.

**The Chapter Handbook v.2 was last revised and approved by the Global
[Board](Board "wikilink") of Directors in 2017. Before that it was
revised by the [Global Chapter
Committee](Global_Chapter_Committee "wikilink") in December 2011. If you

The purpose of the OWASP Chapter Handbook is to provide chapter leaders
with a central place to find information about starting a chapter,
organizing a chapter meeting, handling their chapter finances, and many
other topics that come up in the course of running a chapter. While
there are a few hard and fast rules that chapter leaders must follow,
this handbook is primarily composed of suggestions and best practices
that have worked for other successful chapter leaders. That said, what
works for some chapters may not work for others, and this handbook
should not limit the scope of possibilities for running a strong and
thriving chapter.

Please note that we are in the process of developing a new version of
the OWASP Chapter Handbook. This version has not been updated. Recent
changes have been made to the wiki pages and documented on the Talk
pages for each chapter of the handbook. Please look there for the most
recent text.

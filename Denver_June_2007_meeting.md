The June meeting of the Denver OWASP chapter was be on June 21st at
7:00PM. [Accuvant](http://www.accuvant.com) hosted the meeting at their
downtown office. Refreshments were be provided by
[Symplified](http://www.symplified.com).

The technical presentation was by David Byrne from EchoStar Satellite.
He spoke on Anti-DNS pinning attacks, a technique that allows an
attacker to leverage cross-site-scripting to turn a web browser into a
proxy server. This is done using standard browser functionality; no
client-side vulnerabilities are required. The end-result is that network
firewalls can are completly bypassed to access internal servers.

The non/less technical presentation was by David Stevens from
Symplified. He discussed methods to calculate Return on Security
Investment (ROSI). Considering how difficult it often is to get funding
for security initiatives, this is a useful skill for any security
professional or security manager.

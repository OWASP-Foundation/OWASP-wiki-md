### **Development Issues Within AJAX Applications: How to Divert Threats**

**Name: Lars Ewe**

**Affiliation:** CTO and VP of Engineering for Cenzic

**Abstract:** AJAX has rapidly emerged as a prominent enabling
technology in the movement to improve the Web as a software platform for
business and consumer applications. Using AJAX development techniques
provides software developers with a wide-open platform for creating
innovative new Web (2.0) applications. The result is a more readily
responsive Web environment which minimizes the “start-stop-start-stop”
nature of Web pages, thus increasing the speed and user-interactivity of
Web-enabled services.

However, the open, malleable nature of Web 2.0 also has an often
overlooked impact on application security that is not necessarily
initially visible to application developers, establishing a relatively
easy target for malicious behavior to compromise applications and
overall network security. Various security issues arise from a number of
sources, thus increasing the attack surface of AJAX applications: client
side security controls often replace server side data validation, thus
creating a false sense of security; so do calls to “hidden” application
functionality and URLs; new XML and JavaScript data models, such as
JSON, also enable new attack vectors, like JavaScript Hijacking; and the
open, easy to use nature of so called Mashups often comes at the price
of various security compromises.

Such threats, however, can be thwarted with the proper implementation of
security testing. This session will address the development issues of
AJAX applications from a security perspective, looking at how today’s
common web threats such as SQL injections, Cross Site Scripting, and
others are often magnified in an AJAX environment, and it will also
explore new threads, such as JavaScript Hijacking. Last but not least it
also provides Best Practices for AJAX application developers that are
designed to help manage the security complexities inherent to AJAX
development.

**Bio:** Lars Ewe is a technology executive with broad background in
(web) application development and security, middleware infrastructure,
software development and application/system manageability technologies.

### **Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM)**

**Name: Pravir Chandra**

**Affilitation:** Director of Strategic Services, Fortify Software

**Abstract:** The Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM)
(http://www.opensamm.org) is a flexible and prescriptive framework for
building security into a software development organization. Covering
more than typical SDLC-based models for security, SAMM enables
organizations to self-assess their security assurance program and then
use recommended roadmaps to improve in a way that's aligned to the
specific risks facing the organization. Beyond that, SAMM enables
creation of scorecards for an organization's effectiveness at secure
software development throughout the typical governance, development, and
deployment business functions. Scorecards also enable management within
an organization to demonstrate quantitative improvements through
iterations of building a security assurance program. This workshop will
introduce the SAMM framework and walk through useful activities such as
assessing an assurance program, mapping an existing organization to a
recommended roadmap, and iteratively building an assurance program. Time
allowing, additional case studies will also be discussed. SAMM is an
open a free project and has recently been added under the Open Web
Application Security Project (OWASP).

**Bio:** Pravir Chandra is Director of Strategic Services at Fortify
Software and works with clients on software security assurance programs.
Pravir is recognized for his expertise in software security, code
analysis, and his ability to strategically apply technical knowledge.

challenges and opportunities Dell faced. This session will cover
creating policies/standards, deploying a Security Development Lifecycle
as an overlay to the SDLC, overcoming concerns of developers and
business partners, and addressing global standardization issues. This
talk will analyze the creation and evolution of Dell's Security
Development Lifecycle over the last few years, including
awareness/education/training, application security user groups, security
consulting staff development, risk assessments, security reviews, threat
modeling, source code scans, deployment scans, and penetration testing.
It will include a discussion of Dell's information security organization
and the division of labor among internal security consultants in the
security development lifecycle. It will also explain the development,
socialization, and approval process for the secure application
development standard.

### **Don't Be Next: Developing a Security Mindset Among Web Developers on Campus**

**Name: Ed Murphy**

**Affiliation:** Assistant Director, University Information Technology
Services at the University of Arizona

**Abstract:** This presentation focuses on the problem of bad computer
code and how to prevent it at a university. Web application development
on a university campus is done in a variety ways. Sometimes it is done
with student developers, sometimes with outside vendors, sometimes with
full-time staff and sometimes with a combination of resources. This
presentation will review strategies for developing a security mindset
when doing web development on a college or university campus. The
strategies covered by the presentation include: - Education such as,
developer presentations on vulnerabilities and how to use language
specific libraries to eliminate vulnerabilities. - Developing secure
coding standards for developers. - Changes to the Software Development
Life Cycle (SDLC) to incorporate secure code reviews into the peer
review process. - Leveraging your campus Information Security Office to
make tools available to distributed developers on campus, such as IBM's
Rational AppScan and QualysGuard. - Developing a recommended vendor list
for departments who choose to have web applications built by off campus
vendors. - Work with your Purchasing and Contracts department to
incorporate SANS Application Security Procurement Language into standard
contracts.

**Bio:** Fourteen years experience with software development, database
administration and web servers in both the corporate and higher
education sectors. My experience with web development covers the java,
PHP and .Net (C\#) platforms. Most recently I have been leading teams of
software developers, both full-time staff and student staff, as well as
being a secure coding proponent on campus. I have presented on securing
coding practices (in general), secure PHP code development and on the
value of vulnerability analysis using pentest tools (i.e., IBM's
Rational AppScan). I have also been called upon to lead teams of
developers in the investigation and remediation of several high-profile
web site hacks on campus. Most notably I lead the team that determined
the break in method and implemented the code fixes to secure the Phoenix
Mars Lander's [1](http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=1235) mission site.

### **Avoiding Injection Attacks in the Drupal Framework**

**Name: Dave Keays**

**Affiliation:** LA-Drupal (LADRUPAL.ORG)

**Abstract:** Drupal is a driving force in Open Source Web Applications
and has numerous security features built in. By following a few
guide-lines, all contributed code or modules can have security built in
by design.

Drupal's abstraction layers provide protection against some of the most
common attacks. This paper will be a look at those protections, code
snippets, black-box analysis, and a set of guide-lines to develop
modules for Drupal. It will serve as the first chapter in a free ebook
on Drupal security.

**Bio:** Dave Keays is a freelance PHP developer with over one-years
experience on security within Drupal. He is a member of the LADrupal
Users Group (LADRUPAL.ORG) where he has given talks about secure
development at the LADRUPAL Users Group and design, and has lead a
discussion group on Desktop and Internet security at North Orange County
Computer Club that meets at Chapman University in Orange, California.
His security knowledge is certified by COMPTIA and he is pursuing
certification by both ICS2 and SANS.

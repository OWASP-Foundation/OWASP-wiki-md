### Bio

I provide security services & security training to organisations of all
sizes, my strong background in both development & System/Network
Administration provides a great view on how best to both compromise and
secure required services & applications.

The majority of my work involves working with companies to perform
penetration & security testing, test and improve secure coding practices
and provide security consultancy to companies that are keen to improve
their processes & procedures.

I have great experience in developing & implementing efficient and
effective practices across all sections of an organisation to assist
with securing and retaining external quality recognition such as
ISO27001, CyberEssentials and CSA STAR.

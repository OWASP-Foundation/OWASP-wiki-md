#### Welcome

![Froc2010_sm.png](Froc2010_sm.png "Froc2010_sm.png") **Welcome to FROC
2010, the third annual Front Range OWASP Application Security
Conference\!**

After successful FROC's in June of 2008, and [March
of 2009](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Front_Range_OWASP_Conference_2009),
we are back in Denver, Colorado USA on Wednesday the 2nd of June 2010\!

This year we again present a full day, multi-track event, which will
provide valuable information for managers and executives as well as
developers and engineers.

In 2009, we attracted a packed venue with our great AppSec speakers, and
we hope to achieve the same again in 2010. This year we are organizing
the conference with the support of our colleagues at the [Cloud Security
Alliance](http://www.cloudsecurityalliance.org/), and will feature an
AppSec track as well as a CloudSec/VirtSec track.

#### Registration

Due to the hard work of our organizers and the gracious support of our
sponsors, FROC was a free event in 2008 and 2009. This year, thanks to
the generosity of our
[sponsors](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Front_Range_OWASP_Conference_2010#tab=Conference_Sponsors)
we are offering tickets to the event on a DONATION basis. Pay whatever
you or your company can afford.

#### Agenda

## Agenda and Presentations: 2 June 2010

The agenda follows the successful OWASP conference multi track format,
with opening keynotes and presentations in the main auditorium, split
tracks in the middle of the day, and closing panel discussions back in
the main auditorium.

#### Capture the Flag (CTF)

A capture the flag contest was held, with challenges in the categories
of network, forensics, and web applications. The winner received a new
iPad. Second and third place received an iPod shuffle.

The team that won the contest consisted of four members of the Denver
Defcon group, dc303 (http://dc303.org). This group also plays in the
annual Defcon CTF competition (with about 20 other folks from the Denver
area). If you are interested in joining them for future CTF competitions
(local and abroad), contact mantis1 at gmail.com.

Second place went to Matthew Rowley (playing on his own)

    page](:Category:Global_Projects_Committee "wikilink") (approved)

# Minutes

  - GPC will evaluate proposals and select projects for board approval
  - SoC will be release driven (evaluated by release criteria)
  - Creating June 1 deadline for project templates
  - Project proposals need complete project functional roadmap
      - Roadmap should include technical detail
      - Roadmap should include mile markers for alpha, beta, stable
        releases
      - Proposals will identify objective, measurable goals in roadmap
        to mark as 50% and 100% review points
  - 50% review should be beta quality (if applicable) and 50% milepost
    in roadmap
  - We are encouraging projects to be smaller in scope
  - Agreed on the following: "The participant will create a roadmap for
    the project that includes technical requirements, functional
    requirements, and quality requirements. Preference will be given to
    proposals that use the existing OWASP Beta and Stable requirements
    for quality supplemented with their own technical and functional
    requirements."

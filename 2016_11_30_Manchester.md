**An Anatomy of IoT Security - Dominic Chell**

With an estimated 26 billion devices online by 2020 and in wake of a
number of large scale IoT hacks, IoT security has come under close
scrutiny of late. This talk provides a whistle-stop tour in to the world
of IoT hacking, discussing the various IoT attack surfaces and using
practical examples to illustrate the OWASP Internet of Things Top 10.

**JSON Hijacking - Gareth Heyes**

JSON hijacking is supposedly dead after the Array constructor and
"Object.prototype" setter bugs have been patched or is it? This talk
will show how it's still possible to steal JSON data cross domain using
various browser bugs. Gareth will take us on an epic journey of bug
discovery and if we have time he may even bypass CSP for fun.

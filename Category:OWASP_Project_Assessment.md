## Overview

OWASP has created a system to review projects and the project's releases
to determine the quality level achieved. The initial creation of an
assessment criteria was created for the OWASP Summer of Code 2008.
Though created to benchmark the quality of SoC 2008 projects, it was
also applied to new projects created outside the SoC 2008 process. As
work began to create the Season of Code 2009 (SoC 2009), the lessons
learned by using the first Assessment Criteria were used as input to a
new version. The original Assessment Criteria - now called version 1 -
was the basis for this new methodology. As a result of reviewing the use
of the Assessment Criteria v1 (AC v1), a new assessment criteria was
developed that split the review process into projects and releases.
Starting with the SoC 2009, AC v2 will be the assessment criteria used
to judge the quality of all SoC and new projects.

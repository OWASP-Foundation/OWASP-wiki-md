<p>This is a documentation project. We provide information on threat modeling techniques for web and cloud, with a focus on current and emerging techniques.</p>
<p>Most threat model methodologies answer one or more of the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What are we building?</li>
<li>What can go wrong?</li>
<li>What are we going to do about that?</li>
<li>Did we do a good enough job?</li>
</ol>
<p>This project will gather techniques, methodologies, tools and examples. We will group these using the four questions. This will allow people to easily find advice they can use.</p>
<p>Example: if you are looking for different diagramming techniques you will want to look for all the techniques answering question 1.</p>
<p><strong>Guiding principles:</strong></p>
<p>This project follows a number of principles that all contributions must adhere to:</p>
<ol>
<li>We are vendor, methodology and tool independent: we strive to have examples in as many methodologies and/or tools as possible</li>
<li>Open discussion is promoted: all topics are open for discussion with just one rule: don't be a dick. If you feel information is lacking or missing, let us know via the OWASP Threat Model slack channel.</li>
<li>We come to an agreement: we discuss things mainly in google docs and on slack, if the project leaders feel a concensus is made, we will publish the content to our main website. All published content can be changed by submitting change requests on the Github repository that serves the website</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="licensing">Licensing</h2>

<p>Additionally, we also encourage you to contribute back to the project. We have no monopoly on this knowledge; however, we all have pieces of this knowledge from our experience. Let's begin by putting our individual pieces together to make something great. Great things happen when people work together.</p>

# FAQs

## How can I participate in your project?

All you have to do is make the Project Leader's aware of your available
time to contribute to the project. It is also important to let the
Leader's know how you would like to contribute and pitch in to help the
project meet it's goals and milestones. There are many different ways
you can contribute to an OWASP Project, but communication with the leads
is key.

The best way to achieve this is to join the OWASP threat modeling slack
channel at <https://owasp.slack.com/messages/C1CS3C6AF>

If you are not yet a member of the OWASP Slack community, you can
subscribe at <https://owasp.herokuapp.com/>

## If I am not a threat modeler can I participate in your project?

Yes, you can certainly participate in the project if you are not a
threat modeler. The project needs different skills and expertise and
different times during its development. Currently, we are looking for
researchers, writers, graphic designers, and people who want to learn
about threat modeling.

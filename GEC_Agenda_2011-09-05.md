###### Notes

Kate kicked-off the meeting explaining the goals and outline for OWASP
training events. This should be a two day event as currently organized
around the AppSec conference. The OWASP Global Education Committee is
THE committee to organize training events as those outside the AppSec
conferences. -\> Anthony is totally in for the idea, but suggests at
least 5 day events → Kate and Martin can convince Anthony that a 5 day
event can be the long time goal, but might be one step to far for now\!
-\> Cecil underlines the importance for this

Kate is asking if the setup as: 1. one day ‘member free training’ 2.
AppSec related training 3. stand-alone training events ...would be a
successful and non-competing possibility? -\> Kosta does explain the
one-day training is not so much a training event then a ‘about OWASP’
session

Ultimate goal: As we get more mature in organizing training events, we
would eventually take over the training organization for AppSec
conference. This as the GEC would be the natural committee to be in
charge for this. Currently, the GEC is not evolved enough to do so\!

What is needed to sort out? Lot of stuff is already created by the GEC
since existing, but got into stall. We need to rethink about: -\>
evalutation → Training evaluation form / process → Trainer evaluation

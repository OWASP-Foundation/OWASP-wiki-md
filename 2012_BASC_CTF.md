Attendees will be able to play Capture the Flag during the conference.
No sign-up necessary. Information about the game will be available at
the registration desk. If you are interested in playing, please bring
your own laptop. It is recommended that your laptop have either Chrome
or Firefox web browsers installed. Please note that you will not be
attacking other attendees; the CTF game will be on a remote server. You
will use a NERD wireless connection to the internet, then to the server
to be attacked. There are 10 flags on the server.

The results will be discussed at the end of the conference during the
panel session time. There are no physical or digital prizes, but
bragging rights and peer recognition is of inestimable value.

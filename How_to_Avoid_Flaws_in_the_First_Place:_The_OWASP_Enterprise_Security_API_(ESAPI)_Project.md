Application security is arguably the most difficult IT challenge facing
organizations today. Chasing the 700 types of common weaknesses with
scanners and static analysis is a losing proposition. Rather than
chasing after these vulnerabilities, developers can address almost all
of these problems with a set of 10 to 12 strong centralized security
controls. To make it easier for developers to establish these controls,
the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) has created a clean,
intuitive, and open-source toolbox of the core security building blocks
that every web developer needs. In this talk, Dave will show you how to
create an ESAPI for your organization that will solve the OWASP Top Ten
vulnerabilities, increase assurance, and dramatically cut costs all at
the same time.
